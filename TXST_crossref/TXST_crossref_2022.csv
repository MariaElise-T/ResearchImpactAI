Six full strip loins x 6 steaks per loin x 2 types provided 72 electrical conductivity (CV) observations, and 72 measurements of color variables (chroma, hue, L*, a* b*) of loins. Six core samples per cooked steaks provided 216 Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF) values. EC was also measured on three water types and saline (n=20), and commercial beef jerky samples (n=72). Procedures used for EC were developed in our lab and consisted of using emulsified samples enclosed in a silicon vessel with copper electrodes connected to a digital multimeter. Microsiemens (µS) were measured over 60 s with a sampling rate of two per s. Color variables were measured using a Varian Cary 50 Series Spectrophotometer. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and Pearson correlation coefficients. EC means (µS) were 14.4, 42.5, 34.9, 22.9, 16.1 and 24.7 for fresh steaks (P= .07); and 7.8, 16.5, 6.4, 10.7, 5.2, and 8.0 for cooked steaks (P=.36). Means for all color variables were different (P&lt; 0.05) across fresh steaks. Correlation of EC to each color variable was negative: chroma -0.013, hue -0.050, L*-0.009, a*-0.131, b*-0.110. Only a* was significantly correlated (P&lt; 0.05) to EC. WBSF tenderness (kg/f) means were not different (P &gt; 0.05) across steaks but did differ (P&lt; 0.05) within steaks. Correlations of EC to tenderness was not significant (P &gt; 0.05). EC mean of beef jerky was 106.9 (SEM 5.05). EC of water types differed (P&lt; 0.05) - deionized 0.40, purified 1.56, tap 1.30. EC for saline was 0.04. These data indicate that EC of beef can be effectively measured, but high variations across EC, color, and tenderness values decreased the overall probability of finding relationships.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/100/Supplement_3/103/45963413/skac247.201.pdf",""

Students apply skills and knowledge in practical situations and reflect on their experiences. Our 3000-level service-learning college course, Leadership Development in Agricultural Sciences, involved student-led development and execution of a one-day event, “AgCamp”, held on university campus for high school students (n = 23). Early in the semester, college students (n = 42) were divided into one of ten cohorts. Throughout the semester, cohorts worked together to define and execute deliverables for AgCamp. The day of AgCamp included lectures and demonstrations in Animal Science, Horticulture, and Agricultural Mechanics; lunch; a lecture on careers in agriculture; and small group discussions about college. The objective of our study was to evaluate if participating in a service-learning course affected college students’ development and perceptions of the value of service-learning for society. Texas State University IRB approved this research (#7980). An electronic mixed methods questionnaire-based survey was developed and distributed to college students enrolled in Leadership Development in Agricultural Sciences as a pre- and post-test at the beginning and end of the Spring 2022 semester. Prior to distribution, survey validity and reliability were established. Questions were scored on a five-point Likert scale where 1=Strongly agree and 5=Strongly disagree. Data were analyzed in SPSS 26.0 using measures of central tendency and paired sample t-tests. As a result of participating in the service-learning course, students significantly increased (P ≤ 0.01) their agreement with “I believe I have strong leadership skills,” from a pre-test mean of 2.25 ± 0.67 to a post-test mean of 1.55 ± 0.68. There was also a trend (P = 0.08) for an increase in agreement with “I feel service-learning makes a positive impact on individuals’ lives,” from a pre-test mean of 1.68 ± 0.76 to a post-test mean of 1.45 ± 0.55. In the post-test, we asked students the degree to which they agreed with: “I feel I would have learned more if more time was spent in the classroom instead of a service-learning platform;” 58% of students disagreed or strongly disagreed. We also asked them to respond to “I felt what I learned in this course will be valuable for my future;” 86% agreed or strongly agreed. Further, 79% of students agreed or strongly agreed that they “developed a greater sense of personal responsibility” and 54% agreed or strongly agreed that they “developed a sense of purpose or direction in life” as a result of participation in the course. Ultimately, our data indicate participating in a service-learning course positively impacts college students professional development, in addition to their perceptions of the benefits of service-learning for society.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/100/Supplement_4/19/46604815/skac313.028.pdf",""

Thus, there is a need to identify and implement novel, sustainable feed for livestock to meet food demands for animal-source protein without jeopardizing food availability for future generations. Insects have potential to fill this role as they are protein-rich and can grow on low-quality nutrient sources. However, Western societies traditionally feel disgust and fear towards insects. Thus, while previous in-vivo research suggests insects are suitable feed for cattle, pigs, poultry, and fish, it is unknown if U.S. consumers will accept animal-source products from livestock consuming insects as feed. Our objectives were to determine the demographics of likely consumers of products from livestock consuming insects as feed and identify factors that affect U.S. consumer acceptance of insects as livestock feed. This study was approved by Texas State University IRB (#7722). We developed a quantitative, electronic survey-based questionnaire that was distributed through convenience sampling (e.g., Facebook, Reddit) to adult U.S. consumers. We used a 95 ± 5% confidence level to calculate required sample size. Prior to distribution, we established face, content, and construct validity of the survey instrument using an external expert panel and established reliability (Cronbach’s ɑ=0.77) using 12 consumers representative of our target population. The effects of demographics on consumer attitude were analyzed using a multinomial logit model in R statistical software and factors affecting acceptance of products from insects as livestock feed were analyzed with descriptive statistics. Of respondents (n=361), 34% were accepting of insects as livestock feed, 15% were opposed, and 52% were neutral. U.S. consumers more likely to accept insects as livestock feed were younger versus older (18-24 versus 35-44 years; P=0.05), had a higher average household income ($50,000-$100,000 versus $25,000; P=0.01), and achieved higher educational attainment (master’s degree versus high school diploma; P=0.05). Older consumers (65+ versus 35-44 years; P=0.05) and those with a lower average household income (less than $25,000 versus $50,000-$100,000; P=0.01) were more likely to oppose insects as livestock feed. Respondents reported the top factors that would positively affect their acceptance of insects as livestock feed were: “If I knew the insects were healthy for the livestock” (74%); “If I knew it would not affect the balance of our eco-system” (66%); and “If I knew it would lessen the environmental impact of livestock production” (61%). Ultimately, our data indicate that young, educated U.S. consumers with higher-than-average income are the target market for animal-source protein from livestock fed insects. Our data also indicate that marketing and educational efforts should emphasize environmental benefits of insects as livestock feed to increase adoption by consumers with neutral or negative attitudes.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/100/Supplement_4/28/46604774/skac313.040.pdf",""

Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) often presents itself as the starting equipment for industrial applications and hobby enthusiasts. The introduction of conductive polymer composites into FFF has brought about widespread capabilities, particularly in the areas of flexible sensors, printed electronics, and other multi-functional materials. Piezoresistive sensors have especially been of interest due to their use in wearable electronics and structural health monitoring coupled with the increasing commercial availability of conductive thermoplastic filaments. However, while much research has been devoted to the geometrical parameters in piezoresistive sensors in conventional manufacturing, little has been investigated with respect to additive manufacturing. Here, we present a unique method for tailoring the sensitivity of FFF produced flexible pressure sensors by altering the infill printing settings, therefore affecting the electromechanical response. Sensors were printed using common infill patterns (Concentric, Grid, Gyroid, Honeycomb, Lines, and Cubic) and low infill percentages (5–15%) capable of sensitivities of 2,010 kPa−1 under an applied pressure of up to 60 kPa and 530 kPa−1 under an applied pressure of up to 950 kPa.

There is much interest in determining how to mitigate burden and studies suggest knowledge of the disease and recognizing positive aspects of caregiving may help reduce burden (Abdollahpour et al., 2018; Graham et al., 1997). The purpose of this study was to better understand how certain caregiver characteristics may impact burden. Participants (N=112) completed questionnaires regarding burden, disease knowledge, specific characteristics, and their caregiver experience. Pearson’s correlations were conducted to examine the relationship between knowledge, burden, and caregiver characteristics. There was no significant correlation between burden and knowledge (p =.457), but burden was significantly correlated with positive aspects of caregiving (p &lt;.001) and life satisfaction (p &lt;.001). To better understand how well these two variables predicted burden, a multiple regression was conducted, R² = .352, F(2, 90) = 24.48, p &lt; .001. Our findings provide further evidence that a focus on the positive aspects of caregiving and higher levels of life satisfaction are predictors of reduced caregiver burden. Some prior studies suggested knowledge of Alzheimer’s disease led to decreased burden, whereas other studies found more knowledge increased anxiety, thus increased burden (Zawadzki et al., 2011). Our failure to find a correlation between knowledge and burden levels suggests this relationship may not be straightforward and future research needs to explore more specific aspects of this question.","https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/6/Supplement_1/487/48309568/igac059.1876.pdf",""

Above 132 °C, the strontium ferrite particles can rotate in the nylon matrix. The measured time constant decreases with temperature and magnitude of the rotation field. Model calculations indicate that, for 40 wt. % SrO(Fe2O3)6/PA12 at rotation fields of 500 Oe, the effect of the demagnetizing field on the angle between the magnetic moment and the particle’s easy axis is negligible, allowing one to determine the dynamic “melt” viscosity from the measured transients. The dynamic viscosity decreases from 2 × 105 Pa s at 132 °C to 3.1 × 104 Pa s at 175 °C with a sharp kink observed near 140 °C that correlates with a relaxation from the α′c phase for PA12 observed by others. A yield shear stress was observed for small rotation fields at low temperatures resulting in non-perfect alignment of the magnetic particles. The implications of the measurement results for MFAAM are discussed.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/adv/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/5.0098972/16475582/095223_1_online.pdf",""

Researchers have demonstrated anthropogenic materials, including plastics, to have both beneficial and harmful effects on survival and reproduction. During the spring of 2018, we collected 45 black-crested titmouse Baeolophus atricristatus nests in San Marcos, Texas, with two objectives: 1) to assess and compare the mass and proportion of nest materials along an urban gradient and 2) to examine the relationship between nest materials, clutch size, and hatching success. We categorized each nest based on collection location as urban, residential, park, or rural and separated nest materials into six categories: leaves, snake skin, twigs, moss, plastic, and nonplastic artificial materials. We then compared raw mass and proportion of mass of each nest material among urbanization categories. Nests in the urban category were 1.6–1.9 times lighter in mass than nests in other locations along the urban gradient (P = 0.01) and contained 4–5 times greater proportion, but not mass, of plastic compared to nests in all other locations. Nests in residential areas contained the greatest mass of combined anthropogenic materials. Neither clutch size nor hatching success differed based on urbanization category, nest mass, or proportions of anthropogenic or natural nest materials. The differences in mass of nests and increased proportion of plastics could have been due to a lack of natural nesting materials; however, we did not estimate availability of nesting materials at any location. Results add to the growing literature that the use of anthropogenic materials in nests varies across an urban gradient, and the effect of anthropogenic materials on nesting parameters varies among species.","https://meridian.allenpress.com/jfwm/article-pdf/13/1/236/3085091/i1944-687x-13-1-236.pdf",""

Recently, a computational adjoint based optimization method was used to design shaped film cooling holes fed by internal co-flow and cross-flow channels. The associated RANS computations predicted that the holes optimized for use with cross-flow (X-AOpt) and co-flow (Co-AOpt) would significantly increase adiabatic effectiveness. However, only the X-AOpt hole was tested experimentally in this previous study. Though the experimentally measured performance for this hole was much less than computationally predicted, it still had a 75% improved performance compared to the conventional 7-7-7 shaped hole. In the current study, the X-AOpt and Co-AOpt shaped holes were experimentally evaluated using measurements of adiabatic effectiveness and overall cooling effectiveness. Coolant was fed to the holes with an internal co-flow channel. For reference, experiments were also conducted with the baseline 7-7-7 shaped hole, and a 15-15-1 shaped hole (shown in a previous study to be the optimum expansion angles for a shaped hole). Furthermore, overall cooling effectiveness measurements were made with engine scale models to evaluate the performance of additively manufactured (AM) X-AOpt and Co-AOpt holes with a realistic metal build. Results from this study confirmed that the X-AOpt hole had a 75% increase in adiabatic effectiveness compared to the 7-7-7 shaped hole. However, the Co-AOpt hole had only a 30% increase in adiabatic effectiveness, substantially less than had been computationally predicted. Measurements of overall cooling effectiveness for the engine-scale models and the large-scale models followed similar trends.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/GT/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/GT2022-83436/6935528/v06at12a044-gt2022-83436.pdf",""

Others have contextualised these decedents—many of whom likely belonged to socially, politically, and/or economically marginalised groups in life—as part of a larger identification crisis in the US. However, there has been little discussion surrounding how this humanitarian crisis has manifested in academic institutions, where anthropologists often provide medicolegal consultation and act as long-term stewards of the unidentified. The Identification & Repatriation Initiative was created at the Forensic Anthropology Centre at Texas State University (FACTS) to recognise and investigate unidentified human remains in long-term storage. Our paper outlines common challenges that were encountered during our initial reassessment of unidentified cases at FACTS, emphasising the detrimental impacts of inconsistent procedures, loss of context, and case fatigue. It is likely that other academic institutions face similar challenges, and by highlighting these issues we hope to help initiate a larger conversation concerning ethical stewardship of human remains in these settings. By incorporating humanitarian perspectives into forensic casework, anthropologists in academia can better advocate for the long-term unidentified. Key PointsForensic anthropologists at academic institutions are qualified to act as consultants on forensic casework when requested by jurisdictional authorities and are often responsible for the long-term management of unidentified human remains.The long-term unidentified represent a vulnerable population and academic institutions are not exempt from calls for humanitarian approaches to identification.The Identification and Repatriation Initiative was created at the Forensic Anthropology Centre at Texas State University to acknowledge and investigate unidentified human remains in long-term storage.This paper considers possible ways for humanitarian action to be incorporated into academic settings and suggests anthropologists can better advocate for the unidentified through procedural standardisation, institutional and interagency collaboration and ethical stewardship.","https://academic.oup.com/fsr/article-pdf/7/3/358/50911674/fsr_7_3_358.pdf",""

In this study, 9-9-3 shaped film cooling holes were constructed at engine scale using metal AM, specifically direct laser metal sintering (DMLS). These “as built” geometries were characterized through computerized tomography (CT) scans to quantify deviations from holes with design intent, or “as-designed” holes. To evaluate the performance of the “as-built” holes compared to “as-designed” holes, both adiabatic and overall cooling effectiveness were measured experimentally for 5x scale models. The larger scale enabled the use of finite deposition modeling (FDM) to construct hole geometry that closely matched the “as-designed” holes and the CT scans of the “as-built” holes. Two versions of the 9-9-3 hole were studied, the 9-9-3 rounded inlet (RI) hole with rounding at the inlet, and the 9-9-3 rounded inlet and exit (RIE) hole with additional rounding at the hole inlet, and rounding at the hole exit. Results showed that the adiabatic effectiveness and overall cooling effectiveness for the “as-built” holes were similar to the performance of the “as-designed” film cooling holes for both hole geometries tested.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/GT/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/GT2022-83201/6935637/v06at12a041-gt2022-83201.pdf",""

One of the additive manufacturing methods discussed in this work is binder jetting additive manufacturing (BJAM) process where a liquid-based binder is deposited on the powder bed to make the part layer by layer. In this work, ceramics particles are used to investigate the effect of the part geometry on the density and shrinkage of the part made. Three different shapes (spheres, cylinders, and rectangular blocks) of the same size are printed at 100%, 75% core saturation limit at zero second and 10-seconds delay using a binder jetting 3D printer at 0.2 mm layer thickness. The green parts are de-powdered and dried for 6–8 hours using a drying heater at 35° C then de-bound and sintered to improve the strength and the density of the part made. We use ceramics powder of particle size range 50–200 μm to print the parts. It is found that the apparent density of the rectangular block is the highest in all cases except at 100% saturation with 10-seconds delay. The apparent densities of the sphere and the cylinder are very close to each other. Also, the shrinkage percentage for the sphere is the highest then cylinder comes next, and the rectangular block comes last in all cases except when the core saturation is 100% and delay is 0 second where the cylinder shrinkage is higher than that of the sphere. The reason behind this is maybe the difference in the surface area of each part printed. It is noticed also that the relative density obtained is in the range of about 79% to about 85% and the shrinkage percentage is in the range of 36% to 55%.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2022-96385/6980526/v02at02a026-imece2022-96385.pdf",""

In concrete technology, high‐performance lightweight concrete structures often represent such optimized properties, including cost‐effectiveness and ease of application, while having a lower structural dead load. Although the use of lightweight concrete is often viewed as a sustainable practice, it does not address the high use and dependance on Portland cement, which has a high ecological footprint. In this regard, this study evaluates the engineering properties of structural lightweight concrete containing expanded shale and clay, as coarse aggregate, with a high quantity of coal fly ash (class F and C). For this purpose, a total of 15 mixes have been produced and a comprehensive series of physico‐mechanical and durability tests have been conducted. Based on the results, it is found that expanded clay outperforms expanded shale in terms of physico‐mechanical and durability properties of the resulting concrete, potentially due to its lower particle size distribution (used in this study) and the resulting porosity compared to expanded shale. Nonetheless, comparable physico‐mechanical properties are achieved when expanded shale and clay are used, as a full replacement of limestone. In turn, the performance of class C fly ash is found to be better in mechanical, but lower in certain durability variables, compared to their class F companions. The result of this study is found significant and point to suitability of using expanded shale and clay in combination with high‐volume fly ash.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/suco.202200562",""

They may experience burnout because of stressors related to their clinical education responsibilities and course load. Various buffers have been suggested to reduce burnout in other health care settings; however, there is a limited body of research examining the effect of locus of control and optimism as buffers against burnout in athletic training populations. Objective: To investigate whether a perceived internal locus of control and/or optimism can provide a buffer against burnout in athletic training students. Design and Setting: A cross-sectional observational research design via Qualtrics survey. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 48 professional master's athletic training students enrolled in Commission on Accrediting Athletic Training Education–accredited programs. Data Collection and Analysis: Participants were sent a survey link that included demographic questions, the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory, Life Orientation Test–Revised, and the Rotter Internal/External Locus of Control Scale. Three multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationships of personal burnout, work-related burnout, and client-related burnout with optimism and locus of control. A Pearson correlation was conducted on the significant findings to determine the strength of relationship among variables. Main Outcome Measure(s): Copenhagen Burnout Inventory, Life Orientation Test–Revised, Rotter Internal/External Locus of Control Scale. Results: Significant relationships were identified between optimism and personal burnout (t = −3.30, P = .002) and between optimism and work-related burnout. (t = −2.48, P = .02). No significant relationships were identified between locus of control and any of the burnout-related variables (P &gt; .05). Conclusion: Optimism could be an effective buffer against student burnout in professional master's athletic training programs. Athletic training programs should implement various strategies to promote student optimism including proper social support strategies, time management, and stress management to help reduce the onset of burnout in students.","https://meridian.allenpress.com/atej/article-pdf/17/1/28/3035234/i1947-380x-17-1-28.pdf",""

RSI reporting and recognition was followed by aggressive clinical management in the population sampled, suggesting the need for larger scale epidemiological studies to determine the true prevalence, severity, and typical clinical course of these injuries.","https://journals.humankinetics.com/downloadpdf/journals/ijatt/27/2/article-p78.xml",""

The fourth team is currently working to design control mechanisms to automate the manual dual planetary transmission. The control mechanisms are a combination of mechanical and pneumatic systems that are controlled by a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) program. The transmission will be used in the Machine Elements Design Laboratory to educate students on gear transmissions and levers. SolidWorks software was used to draw and simulate the mechanical parts of the control systems, before being sent to a machine shop for manufacturing. The first control system uses vertical levers and linear actuators to control the brakes, while the second uses horizontal levers and rodless pneumatic cylinders to control the clutches. Willis Gearing Theory was then used to determine the six gear ratios realized by the transmission. To automate the mechanical parts of the control systems, a program was designed and uploaded to the CPU console. A Human Machine Interface (HMI) displays the transmission’s speed and torque readings from the PLC. It is expected that the future group will the finish the automation of the transmission and proceed with the testing phase.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2022-95173/6981848/v007t09a041-imece2022-95173.pdf",""

The hybrid model has two modules: a skeletal module and an OpenSim musculoskeletal module. The skeletal module consists of a dynamic joint strength based 40 degrees of freedom spatial skeletal model. The skeletal module can predict the lifting motion, ground reaction forces (GRFs), and center of pressure (COP) trajectory using an inverse dynamics based optimization method. The equations of motion are built by recursive Lagrangian dynamics. The musculoskeletal module consists of a 324-muscle-actuated full-body lumbar spine model. Based on the generated kinematics, GRFs and COP data from the skeletal module, the musculoskeletal module estimates muscle activations using static optimization and joint reaction forces through the joint reaction analysis tool. Muscle activation results between simulated and experimental EMG are compared to validate the model. Finally, potential lower back injuries are evaluated for a specific-weight asymmetric lifting task. The shear and compression spine loads are compared to NIOSH recommended limits. At the beginning of the dynamic lifting process, the simulated compressive spine load beyond the NIOSH action limit but less than the permissible limit. This is due to the fatigue factors considered in NIOSH lifting equation.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/DETC2022-89127/6942910/v002t02a022-detc2022-89127.pdf",""

We elucidate the relevance of temporal lags for cross-national research by looking specifically at the lagged longitudinal relationship between urbanization and homicide rates. Using cross-national time-series data for ( n  =  83) nations, we run a series of 10 separate panel models, in which we incrementally increase the time lag between the dependent variable homicide rate and two independent measures of urbanization, controlling for changes in GDP and age-structure as well as fixed effects for time and unit. Results from these panel models confirm that the two measures of urbanization are oppositely associated with homicide rates. Moreover, while the magnitudes of the associations for both predictors decline as lag time increases, they continue to be statistically significant. These results provide evidence that urbanization has countervailing and persistent consequences for homicide rates that ripple through time. These results also lead us to conclude that a more systematic approach to lag time in longitudinal research is needed.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/14773708221098990",""

Ecuador, which is heavily reliant on petroleum, agricultural exports, and ecotourism, experienced a rise in poverty in response to pandemic shutdowns. In this study, we sought to quantify levels of illegal timber extraction and poaching before and after the start of COVID-19 lockdowns throughout two protected areas (Reserva Jama Coaque [JCR] and Reserva Bosque Seco Lalo Loor [BSLL]) in the endangered Pacific Forest of Ecuador. We analyzed chainsaw and gunshot acoustic data recorded from devices installed in the forest canopy from December 2019 to March 2020 and October 2020 to March 2021. Results from generalized linear mixed effects models indicated less chainsaw activity before lockdowns (post.lockdown = 0.571 + 0.196 SE, p-value = 0.004), although increased average rainfall also seemed to negatively affect chainsaw activity (avg.rainfall = -0.005 + 0.001 SE, p-value < 0.001). Gunshots were too infrequent to conduct statistical models; however, 87% of gunshots were detected during the ‘lockdown’ period. Observational data collected by rangers from these protected areas also noted an increase in poaching activities beginning mid to late 2020 and persisting into 2021. These results add to the steadily growing literature indicating an increase in environmental crime, particularly in biodiverse nations, catalyzed by COVID-19-related economic hardships. Identifying areas where environmental crime increased during pandemic lockdowns is vital to address both socioeconomic drivers and enforcement deficiencies to prevent further biodiversity loss and disease outbreaks and to promote ecosystem resilience. Our study also demonstrates the utility of passive acoustic monitoring to detect illegal resource extraction patterns, which can inform strategies such as game theory modeling for ranger patrol circuits and placement of real-time acoustic detection technologies to monitor and mitigate environmental crimes.","",""

Ninety recently weaned calves were obtained from Red Bluff Ranch (Norris, MT). All calves were weaned and weighed (prior to transport). Calves were loaded into a livestock trailer, transported for 70 km, and unloaded at the Bozeman Agricultural Research and Teaching Farm for a 42-day preconditioning program. Upon arrival, calf body weight was recorded, and both pre- and post-transport body weight were averaged and used as calf weaning initial body weight. Calves were sorted by body weight, sex, and age, and assigned to receive 1) multiple administration of bovine appeasing substance at weaning (d0), d 14, 28, and before transport and feedlot entry (d 42; BAS; RSEA Group, Quartier Salignan, France), or 2) placebo (diethylene glycol monoethyl ether; CON). Treatments (5 mL) were applied topically to the nuchal skin area of each animal every 14 d during the preconditioning period. Calves within treatment groups were ranked by initial BW, sex, and age, and allocated to 1 of 18 drylot pens. On day 42, calves were combined within treatment group, loaded into 2 different single double-deck commercial livestock trailers, and transported for 1000 km (approximately 16 h). Upon arrival (day 43), calves were unloaded at the same feedyard and with the same pen distribution used prior to transport and fed ad libitum a TMR diet. Blood samples were collected on day 0 (weaning), 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42 (prior transport), 43 (feedlot arrival), 46, 50, 57, 64 and 90. Average daily gain and final BW did not differ (P &gt; 0.52) between BAS and CON calves in both the preconditioning and receiving phases. No treatment effects were also detected (P &gt; 0.44) for daily TMR intake in any of the phases. Overall feed efficiency did not differ between BAS and CON calves (P &gt; 0.54). No treatment effects were detected (P = 0.98) for plasma concentrations of cortisol. A treatment × day interaction was detected (P &lt; 0.001) for plasma haptoglobin concentrations, which was greater (P &lt; 0.01) in CON on day 3 and 7 vs. BAS calves. Therefore, multiple applications of BAS mitigated an acute-phase response associated with accumulative stress caused by weaning, transport, and vaccination.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/100/Supplement_4/14/46604764/skac313.020.pdf",""

The objective was to compare FTAI results in beef cows from two protocols that utilize pre-synchronization. Blood samples were collected on d-14 (d0=CIDR removal) to determine progesterone concentration at the start of synchronization (P4start: ≥1ng/mL=high, &lt; 1ng/mL=low). In a subset (n=1,032), an additional blood sample was taken between d-21 and -29 to determine cyclicity. Cows (n=1,119), from 21 herds, were grouped by days postpartum and age and randomly assigned to one of two protocols. Cows assigned to the PG 6-day CIDR protocol (PG6d) received prostaglandin F2α (PG) on d-9, CIDR insertion and GnRH on d-6, and CIDR removal and PG on d0. Cows assigned to the 7&7 Synch protocol (7&7) were administered PG and CIDR insertion on d-14, GnRH on d-7, CIDR removal and PG on d0. For both protocols, FTAI occurred coincident with GnRH 66 h after second PG. Pregnancy was determined by transrectal ultrasonography 30-40 d following FTAI. The GLIMMIX procedure of SAS (9.4) was used to detect differences in estrus response and pregnancy success with herd included as a random variable. Estrus response (0 to 66 h) was influenced by treatment (P&lt; 0.01; PG6d=60±5% and 7&7=74±4%), Body Condition Score (P&lt; 0.01), cycling status (P=0.03), P4start (P&lt; 0.01), and a P4start by treatment interaction (P&lt; 0.001; PG6d-highP4=62±6%, PG6d-lowP4=58±6%, 7&7-highP4=84±3%, 7&7-lowP4=60±6%).

Presented here are the effects of ambient conditions of temperature, pressure and solvent concentrations on device performance for devices grown using solvent engineering deposition methods. The results show that ambient conditions effect solvent evaporation rates which have a profound effect on device performance. Additionally, the Marangoni effect, described and observed here for the first time in perovskite solar devices, is also observed via its influence on the film parameters. Finally, the case is made that reliable and consistent perovskite devices will need a processing chamber to control the effects of temperature, pressure, and solvent conditions for perovskite devices to be truly commercializable.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/crat.202100116",""

How did their cultural backgrounds and identities (racial/ethnic, gendered, linguistic, other identity markers) shape and/or inform their leadership journeys? The testimonios of the four Latina assistant principals centered on four overarching themes related to the defining aspects of their leadership journeys: (1) the significant role that their parents and upbringing played in becoming advocates, educators, and school leaders; (2) the support and mentorship that were critical to their ascension into the assistant principal role; (3) the challenges they faced with regards to discrimination and microaggressions as Latina assistant principals; and (4) how they responded as agents of change in culturally responsive and asset-based ways as administrators. Each of these defining aspects were shaped and/or informed in some way by their cultural backgrounds and at least one or more social identity markers; often related to their Latinidad, being women, their age, being working to middle class, and bilingual or non-Spanish speaking.

Previous research suggested this pragmaticism was evidenced by either null or positive relationships between seemingly opposite items (i.e., between dispositional and situational crime attributions and between punitiveness and rehabilitative policy support). Pickett and Baker argued that because these studies worded survey items in the same positive direction, respondents’ susceptibility to acquiescence bias led to artificially inflated positive correlations. Using a simple split-ballot experiment, they manipulated the direction of survey items and demonstrated bidirectional survey items resulted in negative relationships between attributions and between support for punitive and rehabilitative policies. We replicated Pickett and Baker’s methodology with a nationally representative sample of American respondents supplemented by a diverse student sample. Our results were generally consistent, and, in many cases, effect sizes were stronger than those observed in the original study. Americans appear much less pragmatic when survey items are bidirectional. Yet, we suggest the use of bidirectional over unidirectional survey items trades one set of problems for another. Instead, to reduce acquiescence bias and improve overall data quality, we encourage researchers to adopt item-specific questioning.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0306624X221133007",""

Minority stressors (e.g., discrimination and victimization) contribute to these poor health outcomes. A salient form of discrimination is the use of gender nonaffirming language, such as using incorrect pronouns or names, yet less is known about other environmental stimuli that may be reined as affirming or nonaffirming. A recent study uncovered the impact symbols (e.g., flags, stickers) may have on invoking positive or negative feelings among TGD youth in the Midwest. Our study further investigates this phenomenon with TGD adults in Texas. During Summer 2021, 3 researchers conducted audio‐recorded semistructured focus groups and interviews with 11 participants who identified as transgender, gender nonconforming, or nonbinary. Interview topics included gender‐affirming and nonaffirming language, positive and negative experiences, nonsupportive and supportive symbolism, and coping mechanisms. In this manuscript, we present findings regarding symbolism. Within our two primary themes, supportive and nonsupportive symbolism, subthemes emerged. Supportive symbolism includes flags and signage, written and oral language and communication, and representation of diversity. Nonsupportive symbolism includes extreme patriotism and religious symbols and highly gendered settings. Further, Texas‐specific culture and a meter of safety were identified as being related to interacting with and observing an array of symbols. Symbolism can have a profound impact on someone's identity development, expression, emotions, coping mechanisms, and access to and engagement with social environments, exemplifying the importance of understanding geographic and cultural‐specific mechanisms within environments TGD people occupy.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jcop.22948",""

To create a soft robot actuated with soft polymeric actuators, this paper describes the development of a lightweight jellyfish-inspired swimming robot, which achieves a maximum vertical swimming speed of 7.3 mm/s (0.05 body length/s) and is characterized by a simple design. The robot, named Jelly-Z, utilizes a contraction-expansion mechanism for swimming similar to the motion of a Moon jellyfish. To better understand the characteristics of this motion, FSI flow simulation, and particle image velocimetry (PIV) tests were conducted to study the wake structure from the robot’s bell margin. The thrust generated by the robot was also characterized with a force sensor to ascertain the force and cost of transport (COT) at different input currents. Jelly-Z is the first robot that utilized twisted and coiled polymer fishing line (TCPFL) actuators for articulation of the bell and showed successful swimming operations. Here, a thorough investigation on swimming characteristics in an underwater setting is presented theoretically and experimentally. We found swimming metrics of the robot are comparable with other jellyfish-inspired robots that have utilized different actuation mechanisms, but the actuators used here are scalable and can be made in-house relatively easily, hence paving way for further advancements into the use of these actuators.","https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2313881/v1",""

Dilute borides, such as BGa(In)As, are typically assumed to be HMAs. BGa(In)As can be grown in higher alloy compositions than Ga(In)NAs with comparable bandgaps, potentially enabling routes to lattice-matched telecom lasers on Si or GaAs. However, BGa(In)As remains relatively unexplored, especially with large fractions of indium. Density functional theory with HSE06 hybrid functionals was employed to study BGaInAs with 4%–44% In and 0%–11% B, including atomic rearrangement effects. All compositions showed a direct bandgap, and the character of the lowest conduction band was nearly unperturbed with the addition of B. Surprisingly, although the bandgap remained almost constant and the lattice constant followed Vegard's law with the addition of boron, the electron effective mass increased. The increase in electron effective mass was higher than in conventional alloys, though smaller than those characteristics of HMAs. This illustrates a particularly striking finding, specifically that the compositional space of BGa(In)As appears to span conventional alloy and HMA behavior, so it is not well-described by either limit. For example, adding B to GaAs introduces additional states within the conduction band, but further addition of In removes them, regardless of the atomic arrangement.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/5.0125109/16517736/193104_1_online.pdf",""

In line with these data, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations capture how the coordinated entry and gating of sulfate into the beta-barrel is eliminated upon mutagenesis to facilitate binding and fluorescence quenching.

The objective of this study was to determine if virus could be found in various areas of the bovine reproductive tract following vaccination. Previously vaccinated beef females (n = 50) were administered a single dose of one of three treatments on d0 of the estrous cycle; BoviShield (n = 20), Titanium 5 (n = 20), or ViraShield (n = 10) based on estrus expression. Blood samples were collected on d0, 15, and 30 to evaluate Infectious Bovine-Rhinotracheitis (IBR) and Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) titers and progesterone concentrations. On d15/16, half the animals from each treatment were non-surgically flushed with sterile saline (Uterine Fluid), and uterine biopsies (Uterine Tissue) were collected. On d17, follicular fluid and granulosa cells were collected by follicle aspirations. Remaining animals had uteri flushed and uterine tissue collected on d29, and follicles aspirated on d31. All samples were evaluated for presence of virus. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS. Sub-luteal progesterone concentrations were observed in 15% of the BoviShield and Titanium treatments on d15 and d30, versus 0% in the ViraShield treatment. Virus isolation and RT-PCR results were negative in all samples for all animals. Titers for BVDV-1 did not differ between treatments (P = 0.99) or treatment by time (P = 0.48). Titers for IBR tended to differ by treatment (P = 0.09) and treatment by time (P = 0.06), while BVDV-2 titers were affected by treatment (P &lt; 0.01) and treatment x time (P &lt; 0.01). Sub-luteal progesterone animals had a rapid rise in IBR and BVDV-2 titers from d0 to d15 and then tended (P &lt; 0.07) to decrease to d30, compared to animals that had normal cycles where titers increased from d0 to d15 and remained elevated on d30.

This unprecedented sensing arises from an enhancement in the kinetics of binding, largely driven by position 138. In line with these data, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations capture how the coordinated entry and gating of sulfate into the -barrel is eliminated upon mutagenesis to facilitate binding and fluorescence quenching. Given the significance of sulfate in metabolic processes, we are now poised to apply SulfOFF-1 in living cells. We anticipate that fundamental insights gained from MD simulations can be integrated with protein engineering to design and expand this unique anion sensing function in the GFP family.","https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/63a223bab9c5f65de5da502f/original/rational-design-of-the-beta-bulge-gate-in-a-green-fluorescent-protein-accelerates-the-kinetics-of-sulfate-sensing.pdf",""

The objective of this study was to investigate the degree of luteal apoptosis after MLV or inactivated vaccine (IV) administration at time of artificial insemination. Beef females were estrous synchronized and on d 0 were vaccinated with a MLV or IV after being transrectally ultrasounded to record presence and location of dominant follicles and CL. Thirteen cows (MLV, n=7; IV, n=6) were selected on d 10-13 across treatment based on dominant follicle size and estrus expression for ovariectomy. Ovaries were obtained and CL were frozen in OCT and sectioned for immunohistochemistry analysis. At the time of ovary collection, some MLV animals had two CL. These were characterized into old or new CL, relative to if ovulation had occurred in response to the synchronization protocol or afterward due to an abnormal cycle, respectively. For immunohistochemistry analysis, two nonconsecutive sections were evaluated for apoptosis using a TUNEL staining kit (ab66110) according to manufacturer’s instructions, with the modification of DAPI being used as a cell marker. Two random fields of view from each section were photographed with a Keyence BZ-X810 microscope and were evaluated for number of total and apoptotic cells. The GLIMMIX procedure of SAS was utilized to analyze percentage of apoptotic cells with image included as a random effect. Percentage of apoptotic cells were affected by treatment (P &lt; 0.0001). MLV-new CL had the greatest percentage (35.56 ± 5.5%) of luteal cell apoptosis, while MLV-old CL (7.05 ± 4.6%) and IV (4.24 ± 4.9%) were similarly decreased. In summary, a greater degree of apoptosis in new CL which formed after an abnormal cycle following MLV administration indicates the ability of MLV to induce estrous cycle dysfunction and extend its effects to luteal cell development and function.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/100/Supplement_3/345/45963559/skac247.631.pdf",""

Our objective was to evaluate survival among 2,704 Texas infants with severe microcephaly delivered 1999–2015. Methods: Infants with severe microcephaly from the Texas Birth Defects Registry were linked to death certificates and the national death index. Survival estimates, hazard ratios (HR) and confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method and Cox proportional hazards models stratified by presence versus absence of co‐occurring defects. Results: We identified 496 deaths by age 4 years; most (42.9%) occurred in the neonatal period, and another 39.9% died by 1 year of age. Overall infant survival was 84.8%. Lowest infant survival subgroups included those with chromosomal/syndromic conditions (66.1%), very preterm deliveries (63.9%), or co‐occurring critical congenital heart defects (44.0%). Among infants with severe microcephaly and a chromosomal/syndromic co‐occurring defect, the risk of death was nearly three‐fold higher among those with: proportionate microcephaly (i.e., small baby overall), relative to non‐proportionate (HR = 2.84, 95% CI = 2.17–3.71); low‐birthweight relative to normal (HR = 2.72, 95% CI = 1.92–3.85); critical congenital heart defects (CCHD) relative to no CCHD (HR = 2.90, 95% CI = 2.20–3.80). Trisomies were a leading underlying cause of death (27.5%). Conclusions: Overall, infants with severe microcephaly had high 4‐year survival rates which varied by the presence of co‐occurring defects. Infants with co‐occurring chromosomal/syndromic anomalies have a higher risk of death by age one than those without any co‐occurring birth defects.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/bdr2.2109",""

Sense of belonging fundamentally influences behavior and is linked to academic and career outcomes. Recent projections indicate there will not be enough qualified college graduates for requisite STEM agriculture careers. Further, there is an ethnic disparity in STEM agriculture degree recipients. As Black and Hispanic students have higher attrition than White students in STEM, there is an opportunity to implement educational interventions to improve their sense of belonging and increase matriculation into the agriculture workforce. The objective of this study was to evaluate if an experiential learning opportunity, a five-day tour of the beef cattle industry, changed students’ sense of belonging with a focus on ethnicity. Procedures involving human subjects were approved by Texas State University IRB (#8309). Students from two universities attended a beef cattle industry tour in the Texas Panhandle in May 2022. Students toured facilities, interacted with industry professionals, and reflected on their experiences through daily entries in journals. Pre- and post-tests were administered via Qualtrics as identical questionnaire-based survey instruments immediately before and after the tour. Questions were adapted from previously validated instruments. Sense of belonging metrics were scored on a 5-point Likert scale where 1=Strongly disagree and 5=Strongly agree. Cronbach’s alpha for the pre-survey was 0.71 and for the post-survey was 0.74. Statistical analyses were conducted with SPSS v.26. Independent sample t-tests were used to evaluate the change from pre- to post-survey responses and one-way ANOVA was used to evaluate the difference in responses between ethnicities. Students (n = 21) were predominantly female (81%); attended Texas A&M University (67%) or Texas State University (33%); and were White (52%), Hispanic (33%), or Black (14%). We combined “Hispanic” and “Black” into a single independent variable to analyze differences between White (52%) and non-White (48%) students. Before the tour, there was a difference (P = 0.05) in sense of belonging between White (4.33 ± 0.16) and ethnic minority (3.73 ± 0.23) students such that White students had a stronger sense of belonging in agriculture. There was no change (P = 0.55) in White students’ sense of belonging as a result of the tour, from 4.33 ± 0.16 to 4.39 ± 0.44. However, there was a change (P ≤ 0.01) in ethnic minority students’ sense of belonging, from 3.73 ± 0.23 to 4.37 ± 0.27. Ultimately, participating in the tour increased Hispanic and Black, but not White, students’ sense of belonging. One potential benefit of implementing experiential learning opportunities in dynamic social environments is improving students’ sense of belonging, especially in careers/industries where ethnic minorities are underrepresented.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/100/Supplement_4/32/46604857/skac313.046.pdf",""

These types of ventures tend to be resource constrained, focused on regional service areas, and rely almost exclusively on replicative approaches to business. Despite their prevalence, these types of ventures receive far less attention in the literature than their innovative, growth-focused counterparts. Thus, there is still much we do not know about how the entrepreneurs behind these types of ventures approach strategy and measure their success. In this qualitative study, we utilize self-determination theory to interpret interview data and illustrate how venture launch and strategic choice allow everyday entrepreneurs to self-fulfill their psychological needs through their business. Doing so, our research answers questions related to: 1) everyday venture launch; 2) the strategies everyday entrepreneurs pursue to position their venture in the market; and, 3) the metrics by which everyday entrepreneurs measure the success of their venture. We find that everyday entrepreneurs self-fulfill their needs for autonomy, relatedness, and competence by launching their ventures and making specific strategic choices regarding competition. More specifically, we find that everyday entrepreneurs primarily rely on differentiation strategies focused on high-quality offerings coupled with a premium customer service experience, while measuring success using an approach similar to the balanced scorecard. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for theory and practice.","https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/erj-2022-0028/xml",""

This study utilizes data from 89 research in a two‐stage structural equation model (TSSEM). The findings show that eWOM usefulness and credibility impact behavioural intentions, and eWOM adoption plays a mediating role in these relationships. The results further signify the moderating effects of social networking sites (SNS) and e‐commerce platforms on the adoption behaviour. Building on the elaboration likelihood model (ELM), this study shows that the central route to persuasion is the dominant predictor of eWOM adoption on e‐commerce sites. In contrast, the peripheral route tends to dominate on social networking sites. The findings improve the current understanding of the diffusion of online information, which can alter consumers' behavioural intentions.

Methods: Population‐based, state‐wide data from the Texas Birth Defects Registry (TBDR) at the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) were used to connect children 9–18 months old, born with select birth defects with DSHS social workers. The social workers reviewed developmental milestones and referred children and their families to various health and social service programs. We tabulated the proportions of children meeting milestones and referral characteristics by referral program type and type of birth defect. Results: Social workers reached 67% (909/1,362) of identified families. Over half of children (54%, 488/909) were not meeting the developmental milestones for their age.

To further test the hypothesis that cardiac muscle mitochondria are more negatively impacted by HS in females than in males, samples were isolated from the left ventricle (LV) of the heart from 3‐month‐old castrated male and prepubertal female pigs that were exposed to thermoneutral (TN) conditions (n = 4 per sex) or HS conditions for 24 h at 37°C (HS; n = 6 per sex). Samples were analyzed for citrate synthase (CS) and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activities, and for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (P) and electron transfer (E) capacities via high resolution respirometry. Data were analyzed by mixed linear models in SAS v9.4 with treatment, sex, and treatment × sex as fixed effects. A traditional marker of mitochondrial volume density, CS activity, tended to be greater in TN males compared to HS males (P = 0.08) but was unaffected by HS in female pigs. Conversely, intrinsic (relative to CS activity) mitochondrial function, as measured by COX activity, was greater in TN females than HS females (P = 0.04) and within HS, males maintained greater intrinsic mitochondrial function than females (P = 0.02). Both integrative (relative to tissue wet weight) and intrinsic mitochondrial leak respiration were greater in HS than TN pigs (P = 0.03) but the contribution of leak to total E (flux control ratio; FCR","",""

These stressors can disrupt the homeostasis of the market pig, that in-turn could result in non-ambulatory-non-injured, non-ambulatory injured pigs or death. The objective of this study was to provide pigs electrolytes and a glucose source in alginate hydrogel beads (AHB) to determine if they could mitigate transportation stressors. A maternal neonatal pheromone was added to the AHB to encourage consumption. Sixty (PIC USA Camborough-22 sow line) market pigs (BW 122.27± 32.72 kg), including barrows and gilts were allocated to two treatment groups, either AHB (n= 30) or control (CON) without AHB (n= 30). Pigs were acclimated to the AHB 72-h prior to transport and fasted 12-h before being loaded on a straight trailer and transported for a total of 4-h. Pig body weights were collected before and after transport and blood samples were collected via jugular venipuncture. Active and inactive postures and drinking behavior were recorded using GoPro Cameras during transport and 24-h post-transport using a DVR in one min scan sample. The study was a complete randomized design with pen as the experimental unit. The AHB did not affect the pigs body weight (P &gt; 0.05). Blood chemistry and blood hematology measures showed treatment by time interactions for PH, PCO2, HCO3, BE, TCO2, TBIL and GLU (P ≤ 0.05). During transport AHB pigs displayed more lying than CON pigs (P &lt; 0.05). After transport AHB pigs sat more (P &lt; 0.05) and tended (P &gt; 0.05) to move more than CON pigs. CON pigs engaged in more drinking than AHB pigs after transport (P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, AHBs had some positive welfare effects on pig physiology and behavior during and immediately after short transportation and show promise as a tool that could be practically implemented by the industry.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/100/Supplement_3/3/45962520/skac247.005.pdf",""

Our paper seeks to identify considerations for weather risk management products to support disaster risk management, through analysis of humanitarian perceptions of the factors and processes that contribute to weather-influenced disasters, taking Somalia as a case study. We carry out semistructured interviews with humanitarian actors familiar with using weather information in their work, and we apply social cascades and disaster risk creation as conceptual tools in our analysis. Our study finds that humanitarian actors perceive historically influenced social networks, livelihood dependence on seasonality, terrorist territorial control, public capacities to manage disasters, and household-level factors related to asset control and coping mechanisms contribute to weather-influenced disasters in Somalia. These factors and processes are part of humanitarians’ dynamic decision-making context. Key insights from our study concern the importance of understanding local geographies of marginalization to design weather risk management products with the context specificity necessary for effective humanitarian actions. Also, assessing weather effects on livelihood calendars can help identify those seasonal weather conditions most responsible for detrimental livelihood impacts. Consideration of livelihood calendars can also promote accurate assessment of the effects of consecutive weather-related hazards on coping capacities and resiliency.","https://journals.ametsoc.org/downloadpdf/journals/wcas/14/3/WCAS-D-21-0165.1.xml",""

We evaluated whether compromising HR by targeting HSP90, a molecular chaperone required for the function of key HR proteins, using onalespib, a long-acting, brain-penetrant HSP90 inhibitor, would sensitize high-grade gliomas to chemoradiation in vitro and in vivo. Experimental Design:: The ability of onalespib to deplete HR client proteins, impair HR repair capacity, and sensitize glioblastoma (GBM) to chemoradiation was evaluated in vitro in GSCs, and in vivo using zebrafish and mouse intracranial glioma xenograft models. The effects of HSP90 inhibition on the transcriptome and cytoplasmic proteins was assessed in GSCs and in ex vivo organotypic human glioma slice cultures. Results:: Treatment with onalespib depleted CHK1 and RAD51, two key proteins of the HR pathway, and attenuated HR repair, sensitizing GSCs to the combination of radiation and temozolomide (TMZ). HSP90 inhibition reprogrammed the transcriptome of GSCs and broadly altered expression of cytoplasmic proteins including known and novel client proteins relevant to GSCs. The combination of onalespib with radiation and TMZ extended survival in a zebrafish and a mouse xenograft model of GBM compared with the standard of care (radiation and TMZ) or onalespib with radiation. Conclusions:: The results of this study demonstrate that targeting HR by HSP90 inhibition sensitizes GSCs to radiation and chemotherapy and extends survival in zebrafish and mouse intracranial models of GBM. These results provide a preclinical rationale for assessment of HSP90 inhibitors in combination with chemoradiation in patients with GBM.","https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article-pdf/28/9/1979/3114721/1979.pdf",""

The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of a graphene Energy Absorbing Layer (EAL) and alginate hydrogel (SA) (w.t. 1% and 2%) viscosity on jet generation in the LIFT bioprinting process. Since SA exhibits a shear-thinning behavior, it is a non-Newtonian fluid. The effect of EAL thickness and SA’s viscosity were addressed for various experimental conditions. After the laser irradiated on the quartz substrate, small holes caused by laser interaction appeared in the interaction area on the EAL. The EAL substrate with multiple holes was examined using an optical microscope, and the morphology of holes was observed and compared. The images of jet generation showed that graphene EAL can assist in the transfer of SA with a low laser energy absorption rate. The viscosity of the SA also plays a significant role in the generation of a stable jet for SA transfer. For the cases with the same laser energy input, the jet generated using higher viscosity bioink had a smaller initial velocity, which eventually led to a shorter jet length. The findings in this study will facilitate the development of new EAL in LIFT bioprinting.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2022-96190/6981019/v004t05a022-imece2022-96190.pdf",""

Horses were housed in individual stalls (3.6 m × 7.2 m). Diets were formulated to meet nutrient requirements including concentrate offered every 12 h and ad libitum access to coastal bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon) hay and water. Treatments consisted of control (CON; n = 8), single-dose (1X; n = 8), two-dose (2X; n = 8), and four-dose groups (4X; n = 8).

It is a key building block in many applications. In practice, solutions that require fewer distinct colors and that can be computed faster are typically preferred. Various coloring heuristics exist that provide different quality versus speed tradeoffs. The highest-quality heuristics tend to be slow. To improve performance, several parallel implementations have been proposed. This paper describes two improvements of the widely used LDF heuristic. First, we present a “shortcutting” approach to increase the parallelism by non-speculatively breaking data dependencies. Second, we present “color reduction” techniques to boost the solution of LDF. On 18 graphs from various domains, the shortcutting approach yields 2.5 times more parallelism in the mean, and the color-reduction techniques improve the result quality by up to 20%. Our deterministic CUDA implementation running on a Titan V is 2.9 times faster in the mean and uses as few or fewer colors as the best GPU codes from the literature.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3543545",""

Formation damage refers to the extent of damage reservoir rocks face from various drilling techniques and/or chemical treatment during well completion. A dynamic filtration test was used to investigate this effect using distinct core samples, brine concentrations and preformed particle gels. The effect of high pressures applied on the particle gels on various core samples with various permeability ranges was determined. These gels were pushed into the core holder with samples and the core permeability change was calculated. Different constant pressures were used to push the piston behind the gel samples. Then, the gel was flown around the core sample and collected in the outlet container. Various hardware was used to tighten the apparatus and provide connection between brine source, syringe pump, piston accumulator, core holder, and flow outlet container. The damage on the core was evaluated by comparing the original core permeability and the core permeability after gel treatments. Pressure gauges were used to measure the pressure drop across the core samples. The penetration of the particle gels into the low permeable formations can be decreased by the best selection of gel types, particle sizes, and brine concentrations under the reservoir condition. This work results can be used to select the best gel types for the right reservoir condition such as reservoir permeability, and reservoir pressure.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2022-89189/6981902/v007t09a038-imece2022-89189.pdf",""

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether SERPINA5 and/or DAG1 could be used as a fertility marker in dairy bulls. Frozen semen from dairy bulls (n=19) were evaluated for concentration of SERPINA5 and DAG1 and percentage of sperm tail labeled for SERPINA5 (SERPINA5-tail) by immunofluorescence in a minimum of 200 sperm cells per bull in two different ejaculates. Semen was evaluated for total motility, progressive motility, and viability. Semen was used for in vitro embryo production (~150 oocytes/bull). Bull fertility was classified by two methods, sire conception rates [SCR - High-SCR ( &gt;1.0) or Low-SCR (&lt; -4.0)] and the ratio of embryos that developed into a blastocyst (BL) from those that had cleaved (CL) as Good (BL/CL≥38.5%) or Poor (BL/CL&lt; 38.5%). The GLIMMIX procedure of SAS was used to evaluate fertility classification with SCR, BL/CL, and the interaction in the model with bull as a random effect. Progressive motility, CL, SERPINA5 and DAG1 concentration, and SERPINA5-tail did not differ (P≥0.14) among SCR and BL/CL classifications or their interaction.

High-SCR bulls had decreased BL (P=0.03; 30.6±1.6%, 35.8±1.4%, respectively) and tended to have decreased BL/CL ratio (P=0.10; 38.1±2.0%, 42.9±1.8%, respectively) compared with Low-SCR bulls. In summary, DAG1 and SERPINA5 do not seem to be a putative fertility marker. In vitro embryo production is not a good predictor of SCR, since High-SCR and Low-SCR bulls may have Good or Poor in vitro embryo developments.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/100/Supplement_3/350/45963537/skac247.640.pdf",""

Mares were balanced by age, BW, and stallion pairing, and randomly assigned to one of two dietary treatments consisting of supplemental L-arginine (50 mg/kg BW; n=5) or L-alanine (100 mg/kg BW; n=4; isonitrogenous control). Mares were individually fed concentrate top-dressed with the respective amino acid treatment plus ad libitum access to Coastal bermudagrass hay. Treatments began on d 14 of gestation and were terminated at parturition. Mare BW, BCS, and rump fat were determined every 28 d and concentrate adjusted accordingly. Parturition was attended with foaling variables and placental measures recorded. Placental tissue from the pregnant horn underwent histological analyses to assess cell-specific localization of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT1) proteins. Semiquantitative analyses were performed using 10 non-overlapping images per sample fixed in a 10X field (Fiji ImageJ v1.2). Data were analyzed using SAS PROC MIXED procedure. BW increased (P &lt; 0.01) in all mares with advancing gestation. BW, BCS, and gestation length of mares were not influenced (P &gt; 0.05) by supplemental arginine. Compared with arginine-supplemented mares, control mares had a thicker rump fat layer (P &lt; 0.01) at parturition. Body length, height, and BW of foals at birth, as well as placental weight, volume, and positive staining for VEGF and CAT1 at parturition were not affected (P &gt; 0.05) by maternal arginine supplementation. These results indicate dietary arginine supplementation (50 mg/kg BW) is safe for gestating mares and promotes mobilization of white adipose tissue. A larger number of mares is required to determine effects of supplemental arginine on embryonic/fetal survival and growth in mares.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/100/Supplement_3/97/45963095/skac247.190.pdf",""

The theoretical framework of the female substitution hypothesis (FSH) asserts that a female-skewed ASR at carrying capacity reflects an overall fitness benefit for females and for males competitive in acquiring access to reproductive females. The FSH predicts that as population abundance increases females should acquire forage more efficiently than males, thereby leading to passive displacement of males. The result is declining ASR associated with differential habitat use by both sexes as food resources are depleted by female scramble competition. We characterized the temporal variation in ASR in a Roosevelt elk population inhabiting the Redwood National and State Parks, California, across 24 years, and determined which of two possible ecological mechanisms was the driver of a declining ASR. The first mechanism explored was that increasing female abundance associated with declining forage in the study area led to the passive displacement of males into the study periphery over time. The second mechanism explored was that a declining ASR was precipitated by a lack of males within the study area and the study periphery. Systematic population surveys from a vehicle were done to estimate abundance and ASR as well as assess male abundance in the study periphery. Forage biomass was estimated in quarter-m2 plots randomly placed in meadows inhabited by female elk. Our multiple regression analysis revealed an inverse relationship between abundance and ASR indicating density dependence. We found numerous males in the study periphery when females were abundant. Our least squares models indicated declining food resources across years when female abundance increased. Our results showed that the first, and not the second, ecological mechanism examined was responsible for a female-skewed ASR. Our findings provide empirical support for the theoretical framework of the FSH in a nonmigratory population protected from hunting.","https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article-pdf/103/6/1373/48720184/gyac075.pdf",""

Strontium ferrite (SrFe12O19) particles have been shown as a great candidate for such applications, since it is an inert hard magnetic material that, in contrast to barium ferrite and neodymium, is also biocompatible. The preparation of such material is done by mixing the magnetic particles into the uncured elastomer (polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)), in liquid form, and then pouring the mixture in a mold for curing. If the samples are subjected to a magnetic field during the curing process, chains of particles are formed in the direction of the applied field, thus creating an easy axis in this same direction. The magnetic properties of such composite cannot yet be found in literature. In this study, we analyzed three concentrations of strontium ferrite particles in PDMS under three field configurations, resulting in 9 different samples. The concentrations used were 1:1, 2:1, and 4:1 ratios of PDMS to strontium ferrite per weight. All three types of samples were cured either in a zero magnetic field, or over the north pole of a neodymium permanent magnet, or over the side of said magnet. A biaxial vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) was used to measure hysteresis curves parallel and perpendicular to the curing field. The samples cured in a field show a squareness ratio of up to 0.94 while the samples cured in zero field, only close to 0.5. The samples cured in a field show a magnetic anisotropy with an easy axis parallel to the curing field. Harvesting these modified properties, a mobile robot manufacturing method is proposed that bypasses the need of applying a high intensity magnetic field.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/adv/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/9.0000338/16464103/035121_1_online.pdf",""

In this regard, a finite element technique was incorporated to determine the physical parameters of the governing equation of motion, where the shear and rotary effects, as well as the gyroscopic couples generated perpendicular to the axis of rotation, were accounted for. Further, the relative velocity between the coaxial rotors was accounted in the equation of motion, which induced a modification on the stiffness and damping parameters. A fourth-order Runge-Kutta method was utilized to estimate the response and power spectra for soft and compact formations. Results indicated that resonance conditions due to gyroscopic effects manifest at soft and compact formations during drilling, however, at soft formations, the natural frequencies separated at lower RPMs, while at compact formations, higher RPMs were required to induce instabilities.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2022-95600/6982345/v009t14a027-imece2022-95600.pdf",""

In this exploratory study, 26 law enforcement officials were interviewed about their experiences and perspectives with SUID investigations. Thematic analysis of qualitative data revealed three specific difficulties law enforcement encounter during SUID investigations: (1) inadequate preparation; (2) overwhelming emotions; and (3) a victim–suspect dilemma. Findings indicate that these barriers may inhibit consistent and reliable investigation of infant death and, therefore, may impede the cause and manner of death determinations. Participants’ narratives also offered insights into potential solutions, including expanded SUID training for law enforcement and use of checklists, such as the Sudden Unexpected Infant Death Investigation Reporting Form. The impacts of overwhelming emotions confronted during SUID investigation warrant further study. The victim–suspect dilemma stems from the inability of law enforcement to conclusively eliminate the possibility of homicide. This dilemma may be resolved through a clear distinction between interactions with potential evidence and interactions with the family. Law enforcement must be trained to treat all SUID families in a compassionate and non‐accusatory manner, while investigating all SUID with careful attention to detail that is essential in any potential homicide investigation. A consistent, meticulous, and compassionate approach to SUID investigations will improve the reliability of information obtained and offer the best opportunity for providing answers to grieving parents.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1556-4029.14982",""

Therefore, the objective of the current study was to determine blood lactate response to increasing exercise intensity in yearling horses, hypothesizing that blood lactate levels would peak immediately following exercise, and gradually decrease over a 3 h post-exercise period. To test this, 32 Quarter horses of similar background (480-520 d of age; 16 geldings and 16 fillies) were randomly assigned to one of four groups (n = 8/group) and exercised using an 8-panel free-stall walker. Exercise bouts were 30 min each, divided equally in clockwise and counterclockwise directions. Test 1 consisted of walking at 1.75m/s, and test 2 consisted of horses alternating between the walk and trot at 1.75 and 4.0m/s, respectively. Blood samples were obtained at the onset (PRE) and immediately (H0), half (H0.5), one (H1), and three (H3) h post-exercise. Mean blood lactate was determined using two portable lactate analyzers previously validated for use in horses. Data were analyzed using PROC MIXED in SAS with PRE values used as a covariate. There was a group × test × time interaction (P &lt; 0.01), where group 3 reached peak lactate concentration at H0 during test 2 (1.37 ± 0.08 mmol/L), while all other groups increased blood lactate concentrations over time to H3 post. Mean lactate post-exercise indicates that horses were able to clear lactate without a sufficient increase in systemic distribution. Values remained below the anaerobic threshold, similar to mature horses, which suggests that sub-maximal exercise in young horses does not elicit an anaerobic response and lactate accumulation.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/100/Supplement_1/48/42758998/skac028.089.pdf",""

Despite their popularity, there remain questions about how useful they are at improving women’s career trajectories or transforming gender demographics at the organizational or industry level. A frequent critique of current women‐focused mentoring efforts is that they reflect and uphold neoliberal feminism and have shifted from collective support to an individualized focus on competition and accruing human and social capital. These programs encourage women to internalize neoliberal subjectivities and prescribe individual change while shoring up ideas about meritocracy that are utterly divorced from gender. I discuss how feminist mentoring, which takes central tenets of feminism including focusing on collective action and organizational change, can serve as a countermeasure to neoliberal feminism and how this form of mentorship can help address gender inequality at work.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/soc4.12966",""

Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this paper is to counter the scarcity fallacy, in which institutions blame the “shortage” of qualified people from traditionally marginalized backgrounds for their own lack of representation, related to prospective PhD students and prospective faculty from traditionally marginalized groups. This study identifies the BS‐to‐PhD and PhD‐to‐tenure‐track‐faculty institutional pathways of Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino engineering doctorate recipients. Design/Method: Using the US Survey of Earned Doctorates, we tracked the BS‐to‐PhD institutional pathways of 3952 Black/African American and 5732 Hispanic/Latino engineering PhD graduates. We also used the Survey of Doctorate Recipients to track the PhD‐to‐tenure‐track faculty pathways of 104 Black/African American and 211 Hispanic/Latino faculty. Results: The majority of Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino PhD graduates in this study did not earn their BS degrees from Top 25 institutions, but rather from Not Top 25, non‐US, and minority‐serving institutions. The results also show the relatively small proportion of PhD earners and faculty members who move into highly ranked institutions after earning a bachelor's degree from outside this set of institutions. Conclusions: The findings of this study have important implications for graduate student and faculty recruitment by illustrating that recruitment from a narrow range of institutions (i.e., Top 25 institutions) is unlikely to result in increased diversity among racially minoritized PhDs and faculty in engineering.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jee.20491",""

We propose three distinct patterns of range contraction: shrinkage, amputation, and fragmentation. We tested the impact of these patterns on populations of a generalist species using forward-time simulations. All three patterns caused 86-88% reduction in population abundance and significantly increased average relatedness, with differing patterns in declines of nucleotide diversity (π) relative to the contraction pattern. The fragmentation pattern resulted in the strongest effects on post-contraction genetic diversity and structure. Defining and quantifying range contraction patterns and their consequences for Earth’s biodiversity would provide useful and necessary information to combat biological annihilation.","https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1673987/v1",""

The numerical simulations of the floating platform dynamics in waves coupled with the sloshing problem in PMTLD are emphasized. Two numerical methods are adopted for fluid computation. The first potential-based approach employs a mixed-type boundary value problem (BVP) solver, which is implemented by the boundary element method (BEM), coupled with a free surface particle tracker, which includes the nonlinear damping effects via a quadratic Forchheimer term for PMTLD. Another equivalent mechanical model is also used exclusively for solving the linear PMTLD. The coupling behavior between fluid and structure is solved by the Newmark method. The second viscous approach uses the finite element method (FEM) to spatially discretize the Navier-Stokes equations and handles the free surface via the volume of fluid (VOF) and the level set (LS) equations. The multiphase simulation is implemented by a computational modeling toolkit Proteus for the fluid phase and Chrono for the solid phase. The correlations between potential flow and Navier-Stokes (NS) models are presented. The PMTLD is designed for a floating platform by analogy with the tuned mass damper (TMD). Numerical results show that the PMTLD can effectively reduce the structure’s dynamic response in terms of vibration amplitude around resonance. Such damping devices have great potential for practical applications in offshore platforms and wind turbine design.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/OMAE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/OMAE2022-79607/6929589/v007t08a046-omae2022-79607.pdf",""

It also compares how the effects of school environments differ between Black and White adolescents. This study analyzed wave 6 of the Fragile Families and Child Well‐being Study, a longitudinal birth cohort study in 20 major cities across the United States. Almost three‐fourth (73.39%) of the adolescents were Black, and 26.61% were White. About half (50.46%) of the adolescents were females, and the mean age of adolescents was 15.39. Multiple regression analysis showed that higher school connectedness and less frequent troubles with teachers were associated with lower depression among Black adolescents. In contrast, only school connectedness was associated with depression among White adolescents. Higher school connectedness was associated with lower depressive symptoms for both Black and White adolescents. However, the magnitude of the effects of school connectedness was found to be statistically weaker among Black adolescents. These findings suggest a need for creating a racially equitable school environment that makes every student feel more connected to their schools, especially Black students.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jcop.22969",""

They possess therapeutic properties against a wide spectrum of diseases, including can-cers, neurodegenerative disorders, atherosclerosis, as well as cardiovascular disease. The phyto-chemical flavonol (a type of flavonoid) kaempferol (KMP) (3,5,7-trihydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4Hchromen-4-one) is abundant in cruciferous vegetables, including broccoli, kale, spinach, and wa-tercress, as well as in herbs like dill, chives, and tarragon. KMP is predominantly hydrophobic in nature due to its diphenylpropane structure (a characteristic feature of flavonoids). Recent findings have indicated the promise of applying KMP in disease prevention due to its potential antioxidant, antimutagenic, antifungal, and antiviral activities. In the literature, there is evidence that KMP ex-erts its anticancer effects by modulating critical elements in cellular signal transduction pathways linked to apoptosis, inflammation, angiogenesis, and metastasis in cancer cells without affecting the viability of normal cells. It has been shown that KMP triggers cancer cell death by several mecha-nisms, including cell cycle arrest, caspase activation, metabolic alteration, and impacting human te-lomerase reverse-transcriptase gene expression. This review is aimed at providing critical insights into the influence of KMP on the intracellular cascades that regulate metabolism and signaling in breast, ovarian, and cervical cancer cells.","https://www.eurekaselect.com/article/download?doi=10.2174/1568026622666220907112822",""

Nonetheless, due to recent concerns over the availability of certain precursors used AAMs (such as the reduction of coal fly ash availability), this study utilized marble powder in various quantities to replace the naturally available kaolin as precursor. This composite use of natural precursors has been entertained to assimilate the production of carbon zero AAMs. To evaluate the physico‐mechanical and microstructural characteristics of the materials, 48 mixes with different sodium (Na) concentrations, curing temperatures, and marble powder content have been used. The results show that rising curing temperature is more effective than other variables, such as the Na and marble powder content on the physico‐mechanical performance of tested geopolymers. In this regard, it is found that a very high Na content can have adverse effect on the properties, potentially due to altered Na/Si, Na/Al ratio in the mixes. Furthermore, the inclusion of marble powder is found to be effective in decreasing the overall porosity up to ~31% and enhancing the physico‐mechanical properties of the specimens cured at 20 and 80°C. Nonetheless, results show that when specimens containing marble powder are exposed to higher curing temperatures (above 80°C) the presence of marble powder adversely affects physico‐mechanical properties. It is concluded that this phenomenon is caused by the dehydration of chemically bound water in higher temperatures when marble powder is used. This result is further confirmed by microstructural tests.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/suco.202201010",""

Thus, if body composition can be reliably estimated relative to maturity, SWG and DMI can be used to calculate performance-adjusted net energy values using a quadratic solution. Likewise, SWG can be predicted from 13.91 × RE0.9116 x EQSBW-0.6837.

The physiological, behavioral and life-history mechanisms associated with the success of such species in urbanized habitats are not well understood, especially in freshwater ecosystems. Here, we examined the glucocorticoid (GC) profiles, life-history traits, and behavior of two species of fish across a gradient of urbanization to understand coping capacity and associated trade-offs. We studied the tolerant live-bearing Western Mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) for two years and the slightly less tolerant, egg-laying, Blacktail Shiner (Cyprinella venusta) for one year. We used a water-borne hormone method to examine baseline, stress-induced, and recovery cortisol release rates across six streams with differing degrees of urbanization. We also measured life-history traits related to reproduction, and for G. affinis, we measured shoaling behavior and individual activity in a novel arena. Both species showed a trend for reduced stress responsiveness in more urbanized streams, accompanied by higher reproductive output. Although not all populations fit this trend, these results suggest that GC suppression may be adaptive for coping with urban habitats. In G. affinis, GC recovery increased with urbanization, and individuals with the lowest stress response and highest recovery had the greatest reproductive allotment, suggesting that rapid return to baseline GC levels is also an important coping mechanism. In G. affinis, urban populations showed altered life-history trade-offs whereas behavioral traits did not vary systematically with urbanization. Thus, these tolerant species of fish may cope with anthropogenically modified streams by altering their GC profiles and life-history trade-offs. These results contribute to understanding the mechanisms driving species-specific adaptations and thereby community structure in freshwater systems associated with land-use converted areas.","https://academic.oup.com/icb/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/icb/icac002/42854481/icac002.pdf",""

We predicted that: (a) niche processes would dominate at high latitudes due to increased climatic stress, consistent with the physiological tolerance hypothesis and the Dobzhansky–MacArthur hypothesis and (b) dispersal limitation would prevail at low latitudes due to narrower niches and smaller range sizes, as postulated by the dispersal–ecological specialization trade‐off hypothesis, the latitude–niche breadth hypothesis, and Rapoport's rule. Location: Central United States. Time period: 1993–2019. Major taxa studied: Stream algae, insects, and fish. Methods: We examined the relative effects of environment (climate and physicochemistry) versus space on stream biodiversity in seven latitudinal zones, spanning 19 latitudinal degrees. In each zone, species richness (α‐diversity) was analysed with multiple regression and variance partitioning. Compositional dissimilarity (β‐diversity) within zones was assessed with distance‐based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) and variance partitioning. Results: For α‐diversity, latitudinal variability of niche and dispersal processes conformed to our predictions in all three groups, except for dispersal processes in insects. However, the drivers of β‐diversity did not follow our predictions. The latitude–niche breadth hypothesis and Rapoport's rule were weakly supported only in fish. Main conclusions: The importance of niche and dispersal processes varied predictably along the latitudinal gradient only for α‐diversity. However, the niche effects were driven mostly by physicochemistry, and the dispersal effects were not always linked with ecological specialization and range size. This suggests that climate‐based biodiversity theories do not have particular relevance for the streams in our study. Niche processes had a greater impact than dispersal processes across species groups and diversity metrics, emphasizing the primary role of the environment.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/geb.13595",""

Therefore, there is an urgent need of advanced treatment regimens. Particularly the subgroups of estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancers (ENBC) and the even worse triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a subtype of ENBC with a high metastatic potential, are lacking efficient treatment methods. Thus, developing more effective drugs for ENBC/TNCB treatment remains an unmet medical need. The pro-apoptotic protein Bax in active form was shown to be downregulated in most cancers. As a result, the balance between Bax and its antagonist Bcl-2 gets disturbed, thereby leading to dysfunctional apoptotic signaling in favor of cancer cell survival. Hence, drug discovery for Bax activation is a promising approach for developing novel cancer therapies. The small molecules GL0385 and GL0388 were identified from our progenitor molecules including small-molecule Bax activator (SMBA1), CYD-2-11, and CYD-4-61. The CYD compounds specifically target the Ser184 residue of Bax and have shown apoptosis-inducing effects in vitro and in vivo. These lead Bax activators provided proof-of-concept studies while further optimization is imperative to mitigate potential toxicity, leading to the discovery of advanced lead molecules GL0385 and GL0388. Treatment with either GL0385 or GL0388 resulted in significantly decreased cell proliferation in MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, BT549, MDA-MB-453, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-361 cells. Additionally, MDA-MB-231 cells treated with GL0385 or GL0388 showed reduced migration and invasion, compared to control cells. Western blot analysis confirmed increased protein levels of Bax, cleaved PARP, cleaved caspase 3, and cytochrome C. These results demonstrate that GL0385 and GL388 have a significant impact on cancer cell proliferation and cellular motility which are main attributes of metastasizing cells. Additionally, increased expression of apoptosis markers indicates that these compounds may be beneficial to regain the anti-apoptotic/pro-apoptotic balance in breast cancer cells. In vivo, both GL0385 and GL0388 show moderate tumor growth inhibition. Further chemical optimization has achieved additional drug candidates including GL0469. Breast cancer cells treated with GL0469 resulted in significant reduction of cell proliferation. Therefore, GL0385, GL0388, and GL0469 are promising new advanced lead compounds towards the development of effective therapies for breast cancers and other cancers with improved safety profiles. Further investigation is warranted to fully explore their anti-cancer potential and mechanisms of action.

STAT3 protein dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus to eventually transactivate downstream target genes. Despite some progress has been made in the past two decades, to date there is still lack of FDA-approved STAT3 inhibitors available for clinical use. Recently, proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology has dramatically advanced the development of therapeutics by introducing targeted protein degradation. Previously, our team has developed HJC0152, a promising STAT3 inhibitor, via structure- and fragment-based drug design strategies and in silico molecular modeling and docking. HJC0152 has demonstrated an attractive cancer therapeutic and preventive efficacy by targeting the non- estrogen receptor (ER)-based STAT3 signaling pathway. To achieve better potency and inhibition of STAT3 signaling, we therefore developed a series of HJC0152-based PROTAC protein degraders. These potential anticancer agents have been initially evaluated and several showed favorable potency in inhibiting the proliferation in a panel of breast cancer cell lines. We found that compounds JMX1122, JMX1123, and JMX1124 significantly inhibited proliferation and colony formation of a highly aggressive triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line, MDA-MB-231, and the ER-positive breast cancer cell lines. Different from the lead compound HJC0152, which showed an early inhibition on the phosphorylation of STAT3 at the Tyr705 and Ser727 residues, the newly developed HJC0152-PROTACs showed a significantly late differential inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation at the Tyr705 and Ser727 residues, and reduced the total STAT3 protein level at 72 hours of treatment. Our current results support the notion that HJC0152-based PROTAC degraders potently suppress breast cancer cell proliferation and induce apoptosis, via direct targeting of STAT3 and its protein degradation. These compounds are currently being investigated for breast cancer cell migration and invasion, and will be evaluated for the in vivo inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis in different mouse models.

Utilizing a sample of 274 franchised fitness center locations across the United States, this study reports a negative relationship between a franchisee’s appetite for independence and their center’s financial performance. However, we also report that this adverse relationship is positively mediated when channeled through the franchisee’s personal initiative and self-awareness. These findings suggest that although the desire for autonomy may not be the most desirable franchisee disposition, its detrimental impact on performance may be suppressed if franchisees are aware of their strengths and weaknesses and demonstrate superior initiative and proactive behaviors.","https://jsbs.scholasticahq.com/article/31716-channeling-franchisee-independence-how-personal-initiative-and-self-awareness-mediate-the-relationship-between-desire-for-autonomy-and-franchise-perf",""

The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of maladaptive psychopathological traits, volitional instability, and their effect on two-year outcomes in patients undergoing shoulder stabilization surgery. Methods:: A prospective multi-center cohort study led by the Multicenter Orthopaedic Outcomes Network (MOON) Shoulder Group targeted all subjects having surgical shoulder stabilization and collected patient-reported outcomes at baseline and at two years postoperatively. Psychopathological traits were assessed using the Personality Assessment Screener (PAS), a validated personality assessment tool. Longitudinal analyses were performed using multivariable regression models to determine predictors of two-year outcomes adjusting for confounders measured at index such as age, sex, smoking, BMI, volitional instability, and intraarticular pathology. Results:: The cohort (n = 890) was 80% male with a median age of 21.5 years. The prevalence of psychopathological traits was 20%. While all patients improved between baseline and 2 years, with adjusted analyses, the presence of maladaptive psychological traits present at the time of index surgery were predictive of lower WOSI (p = 0.001), ASES (p = 0.016), SANE (p = 0.03), and SF-36 MCS (p = 0.001) scores as well as a higher risk of failure (p = 0.04) at two years. As a main effect, volitional instability was not a predictor of WOSI, ASES, SANE, SF-36 or failure at two years. However, all models allowed for the interaction between volitional instability and the PAS, and this interaction was significant for WOSI (p = 0.006), SANE (p = 0.03), and SF-36 MCS (p = 0.003) scores at two years. In other words, the effect of volitional instability on the WOSI, SANE, and SF-36 MCS scores depends on the value of the PAS, and with high PAS scores it is associated with worse outcomes. This data is depicted in Figures 1-3. Conclusions:: While all patients improved, the presence of maladaptive psychopathological traits at the time of index surgery was a predictor of poorer outcomes at two years. Voluntary dislocators did similarly as non-voluntary dislocators up to a PAS score of ˜ 20, where above this they had worse WOSI, SANE, SF-36 MCS and higher failure rates at 2 years post-operatively.

Oral fluid is easy to collect, noninvasive, and may indicate recent drug use. There are limited methods available that analyze cognitive stimulants in oral fluid. Cognitive stimulants are used to treat attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a neurological disorder that emerges from lack of dopamine in the brain. To combat this disorder, medications inhibit dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake by blocking transporters in the brain. Though commonly diagnosed in children, ADHD may extend beyond adolescence and abuse of medications in college students is not uncommon.

Patients in a private facility (N = 3343) completed measures assessing suicide history and general personality traits. Four moderation analyses were conducted with extraversion moderating the relationship between neuroticism and suicide ideation, single attempt (compared to zero attempts), and multiple attempts (compared to zero attempts and to single attempts). Extraversion moderated neuroticism only when comparing individuals with multiple suicide attempts to those with no attempts. Individuals who were low in both neuroticism and extraversion had higher levels of attempts than individuals with low neuroticism and high extraversion, highlighting the importance of considering biological predispositions as risk factors for suicide.","",""

Unfortunately, many ADCs were closed during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving caregivers without an important resource. The current study sought to identify novel challenges that caregivers experienced with the closure of ADCs. From May to July 2020, caregivers were recruited from ADCs across the United States and completed an online survey regarding ADC use, feelings of caregiver burden, perceived stress, and perceived change in these variables and others (i.e., time spent caregiving, caregiver and care recipient memory) resulting from the pandemic. Qualitative reports of additional pandemic-related caregiving experiences were also captured. The current work included 70 caregivers, most of whom were caring for a family member with dementia. Correlational analyses indicated that more frequent ADC use prior to the pandemic was associated with reporting an increase in the amount of time spent on caregiving tasks, an increase in caregiver burden, and increased feelings of stress since the onset of the pandemic. Prior use was not related to change in perceptions of caregiver forgetfulness or changes in care recipient memory behaviors. Prominent themes from caregivers’ qualitative reports included mental health concerns, apprehension regarding the virus itself, and the need for respite. These findings support theories of caregiver stress (Pearlin et al., 1990) and provide insight into how caregivers were impacted by the loss of a key resource to support their caregiving.","https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/6/Supplement_1/826/48315492/igac059.2969.pdf",""

To achieve robust exciton-polariton emission, strong photon-exciton couplings are required at the TMD monolayer, which is challenging due to its limited thickness. High-quality(Q)-factor optical cavities with narrowband resonances are an effective approach but typically limited to a specific excitonic state of a certain TMD material. Herein, we achieve on-demand exciton-polariton emission for a wide range of monolayer TMDs by hybridizing 2D excitons with broadband Mie resonances spanning the whole visible spectrum. By tightly confining broadband light at the TMD monolayer, our one type of Mie resonator on different TMDs enables enhanced light-matter interactions with multiple excitonic states simultaneously.

Although research has examined the role of personality traits such as neuroticism in nightmares, it is unknown if other hypervigilance-related characteristics predict nightmares. Social vigilance, or monitoring one’s social environment for potential threats, is one factor that may influence stress reactivity and sleep. Nurses are one population who may be particularly susceptible to social vigilance and nightmares given their stressful work environments. The current study had two aims: 1) to examine the association between social vigilance and nightmares (assessed via retrospective questionnaire and via daily sleep diaries), and 2) to examine if perceived job stress strengthened the association between social vigilance and nightmares. Methods: Participants were 464 nurses (mean age = 39.03 years, SD = 11.07 years, 91% female) recruited from two Dallas-area hospitals. At baseline, nurses completed the Social Vigilance Questionnaire (SVQ), the Nightmare Disorder Index (NDI; a newly validated scale measuring past-month nightmare frequency and severity), and the Challenge- and Hindrance-Related Self-Reported Stress Scale (CHRSS). Nurses then completed 14 days of sleep diaries to assess daily nightmare frequency, which were then summed across the 14 days. Multiple linear regression models were run to assess main effects of social vigilance and hindrance or challenge stress, as well as their interactions, on nightmares. Results: Greater social vigilance (β = 0.10, p = 0.041) and greater hindrance stress (β = 0.13, p = 0.031) each predicted more nightmare symptoms as measured by the NDI, but not nightmare frequency as measured by the daily surveys. Only greater hindrance stress predicted greater daily nightmare frequency as measured by the daily surveys (β = 0.14, p = 0.015). Social vigilance did not interact with either hindrance or challenge stress to predict nightmares. Conclusion: Results indicate nurses who report higher levels of social vigilance or hindrance stress at work experience more nightmare symptoms. Although more research is needed, supporting nurses who report high levels of stress and vigilance may help reduce their arousal and improve their sleep.

The ASME B&PV code III outlines stringent requirements for the approval of materials where each heat is to be tested to 10,000+ hours to be qualified for service. Additionally, components operating at a range of service conditions require tests to be performed at many combinations of stress and temperature. Subsequently, it takes years to decades for new creep-resistant alloys to be implemented due to the number, duration, and costs of tests involved. The increasing demand for new alloys for IGT applications and the desire to reduce qualification time has driven the urge for rapid qualification testing, calibration, and modeling techniques. To that end, a datum temperature (DT) calibration approach is applied to a contemporary creep-damage model for improved long-term extrapolation of creep data. In the DT approach, data across multiple temperatures are mathematically transferred to a datum temperature creating a master curve. This collapse of the data to a single isotherm (i.e. master curve) increases the amount of data available for model calibration. Next, the model is calibrated to the master curve; afterward, the model is transferred back to original temperatures. A DT approach can significantly reduce: the overall duration of creep testing; effort required for model calibration; and eliminate the requirement for temperature-dependent material constants.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/PVP/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/PVP2022-82064/6939951/v04at06a026-pvp2022-82064.pdf",""

Does were offered a commercially available pelleted deer feed (Record Rack, Cargill, Inc., Wayzata, MN) ad-libitum formulated to provide 10g SCFP/kg feed (XPC; n=52) or the same basal pellet containing the other product at 8.8g SCFP/kg feed (NaturSafe; n=52) to provide approximately 12.5g XPC or 11g NaturSafe per animal daily (Diamond V Mills, Cedar Rapids, IA). Does were on diets for 86±19d prior to fawning and through lactation. Upon discovery of a newborn fawn, BW and morphological measurements were obtained using a soft tape measure. Fawns were weaned at 90d of age and remained on trial for 270-d post-weaning. Fawns were provided with the same diet as their dam throughout the study. Body weights were recorded every 90d during the post-weaning period. Antlers of yearling bucks were scored and weighed after removal of antlers the subsequent fall. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS with main effects of treatment and sex with age of fawn as a covariate. There were no differences in morphological measurements of fawns at birth. Fawns in the NaturSafe group had a greater (P=0.02) weaning weight than fawns in the XPC group, but there were no differences in post-weaning weights. There was a tendency (P=0.11) for a lower mortality rate for fawns in the NaturSafe group. Yearling bucks in the NaturSafe group had a greater antler score (P&lt; 0.01) and antler mass (P=0.02) than bucks in the XPC group. Results indicate a reduction in fawn mortality, improvement in weaning weight, and increased antler growth in yearling bucks supplemented with NaturSafe compared to those supplemented with XPC.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/100/Supplement_3/331/45963885/skac247.605.pdf",""

Building from transactive memory (TM) theory and using data from 741 SMEs in 33 emerging markets, we develop and test a contextualized framework of SME innovation that considers gendered effects in ownership, workforce composition, and communication. Findings indicate that in emerging markets, female‐led SMEs employ more women than male‐led SMEs, and more women in SMEs (even at modest levels) enhance and enable the TM system to deliver more innovation outcomes. Findings also suggest that emerging‐market SMEs can be innovative through differing configurations of women in ownership and workforce composition, underscoring the importance of gendered and contextual considerations in innovation research. Managerial Summary: Innovation is vital to the social progress and economic development of emerging markets. Even though institutionalized gender bias in emerging markets tends to constrain (rather than empower) women's entrepreneurial activities, our study reveals how women can be an important source of innovation. We find that women in emerging markets are stronger together: women in ownership advocate for and support other women by employing them in their SMEs, and in turn, as women's representation increases in SMEs, women are empowered to collectively share and leverage their endowed resources for innovation. Thus, our study challenges the general perception that men are more innovative than women by revealing that the presence of women in emerging‐market SMEs yields greater innovation outcomes.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/sej.1422",""

Cows were synchronized using the 7-d CO-Synch+CIDR® protocol and grouped by estrus expression 48h after prostaglandin (d0) [Estrual (PC): n = 198; Non-estrual: n = 406]. Non-estrual cows were administered GnRH and randomly assigned to Estradiol treatment (E2: n=202; 0.1mg estradiol 17-β) or no treatment (NC: n = 204). In vivo produced embryos were transferred on d7, with grade, stage, and flush balanced across treatments. Circulating concentrations of estradiol and progesterone were determined on d0 and d7, respectively. Abundance of PAGs was determined on d24 and d26. Cows that were pregnant on d30 were grouped by age (H: 2, C: &gt;2 years) and subjected to analysis. Correlations were analyzed using PROC CORR in SAS, while PAGs were analyzed using PROC GLIMMIX with treatment, age, year, sire, and embryo grade and stage as fixed effects. Abundance of PAGs on d24 was influenced by treatment (P = 0.01; PC=0.75±0.09, E2=0.59±0.09, NC=0.56±0.08), age (P &lt; 0.01; H=0.75±0.09, C=0.52±0.08), year (P &lt; 0.0001; 2019=0.42±0.08, 2020=0.84±0.09), and sire (P = 0.02; A=0.49±0.12, B=0.62±0.09, C=0.47±0.11, D=0.77±0.08, E=0.83±0.21), but not embryo grade (P = 0.89) or stage (P = 0.40). There was a negative correlation between d0 estradiol and d24 PAGs (P &lt; 0.0001, r=-0.34), and a positive correlation between d7 progesterone and d24 PAGs (P &lt; 0.0001, r=0.36). On d26, PAGs tended to differ by treatment (P = 0.09; PC=2.43±0.20, E2=2.33±0.21, NC=2.03±0.20). Age (P = 0.02; H=2.48±0.22, C=2.05±0.16), and sire (P = 0.0007; B=2.01±0.20, D=2.52±0.17) influenced PAGs, but embryo grade (P = 0.33) and stage (P = 0.32) did not on d26. Sire was associated with PAGs, and presumably embryo attachment, but not pregnancy rate. Increased progesterone concentrations on d7 were correlated with earlier attachment as measured by PAGs. Estrus expression prior to d0 may enhance earlier attachment of the fetal/maternal interface, and supplemental estradiol on d0 may improve attachment by d26 when ovulation is induced.

An experiment shows this frame works by reducing persuasion knowledge and increasing perceived behavioral control, resulting in science skeptics being significantly more likely to intend to take action, engage with the news, and agree with the story’s perspective. This effect is moderated by science skepticism, with adaptive frames working significantly better on the very people the news media are not reaching. We contribute to theory with an understanding of how a frame that eliminates references to deep-seated beliefs is more effective than the existing frames of conflict, attribution of responsibility, and possibly others.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/00936502221084925",""

However, it suffers from the curse of dimensionality in higher orders. Approximate dynamic programming (ADP) methods can remedy this by finding near-optimal rather than exact optimal solutions. In summary, ADP uses function approximators, such as neural networks, to approximate optimal control solutions. ADP can then converge to the near-optimal solution using techniques such as reinforcement learning (RL). The two main challenges in using this approach are finding a proper training domain and selecting a suitable neural network architecture for precisely approximating the solutions with RL. Users select the training domain and the neural networks mostly by trial and error, which is tedious and time-consuming. This paper proposes trading the closed-loop solution provided by ADP methods for more effectively selecting the domain of training. To do so, we train a neural network using a small and moving domain around the reference signal. We asses the method’s effectiveness by applying it to a widely used benchmark problem, the Van der Pol oscillator; and a real-world problem, controlling a quadrotor to track a reference trajectory. Simulation results demonstrate comparable performance to traditional methods while reducing computational requirements.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2022-96769/6981400/v005t07a064-imece2022-96769.pdf",""

The quadcopter dynamics consists of twelve states and four controls. The states are defined using two related reference frames: the earth frame, which describes the position and angles, and the body frame, which describes the linear and angular velocities. The quadcopter has six outputs and four controls, so it is an underactuated nonlinear system. The optimal control for the system is derived by solving a discrete-time recursive Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation using a linear in-parameter neural network. The neural network is trained to find a mapping between a target costate vector and the current states. The network’s weights are iteratively trained using the least-squares approximation method until the maximum number of iterations or convergence is reached, and training begins at the final time and proceeds backward to the initial time. The trained neural controller applies online optimal feedback control that tracks a trajectory, minimizes control effort, and satisfies the optimality condition. The SNAC method provides a controller that can handle all initial conditions within the domain of training and all times less than the training’s final time.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2022-96834/6981474/v005t07a035-imece2022-96834.pdf",""

This examination is important because the internal audit function (IAF) is uniquely positioned to provide experiences that could influence future managerial behavior, including limiting the potential negative repercussions of earnings management. We find that firms with managers that have internal audit experience are associated with lower real earnings management (REM) but not accruals‐based earnings management. Effects are strongest when managers with internal audit experience have greater power or currently hold financial roles, or when there are a greater number of managers with internal audit experience. The results are robust to including firm fixed effects, using entropy‐balancing and performance‐matching approaches, using a subsample of firm‐years required to have an IAF, using a subsample of firms for which we can measure IAF quality, and measuring internal audit experience at a previous employer. These results point to an important benefit of manager internal audit experience, as research suggests that REM is common, difficult to detect, not always within the scope of financial reporting regulators, and detrimental to future performance.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1911-3846.12770",""

We hypothesize that audit committees whose members have no Big 4 auditing experience are likely to struggle when interviewing prospective Big 4 partners, leading such committees to draw on superficial, heuristic cues in lieu of conducting more substantive evaluations. To test this prediction, we obtain independent ratings of the facial attractiveness of audit partners identified from Form AP filings recently mandated by the US PCAOB. Our primary finding is that audit committees with no Big 4–experienced members are more likely to favor partners whose photographs raters view to be highly attractive. We characterize attractiveness as a superficial attribute for auditor selection because we detect no relation between attractiveness and accruals‐ or restatement‐based measures of financial reporting quality for audit committees with one or more Big 4–experienced members. We do find an inverse association between attractiveness and financial reporting quality for committees without this experience, likely reflecting the statistical implication of a selection bias. We conclude that auditing expertise mitigates the influence of superficial considerations in auditor selection, enabling audit committees to fulfill their stewardship role more effectively.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1911-3846.12736",""

An actor-critic optimal controller generates the desired velocities in the upper-level control, and its parameters are tuned by reinforcement learning. The desired velocities are generated using the upper-level controller, which is then used to solve for the lower-level control algebraically.

We confirmed 38 hub miRNAs as associated with HCC in F2 hybrid mice derived from radiogenic HCC susceptible and resistant founders. When compared to a panel of 12 circulating miRNAs associated with human HCC, two had no mouse ortholog and 7 of the remaining 10 miRNAs overlapped with the 38 mouse HCC hub miRNAs. Using small RNA sequencing data generated from serially collected plasma samples in F2 mice, we examined the temporal levels of these 7 circulating miRNAs and found that the levels of 4 human circulating markers, miR-122-5p, miR-100-5p, miR-34a-5p and miR-365-3p increased linearly as the time approaching HCC detection neared, suggesting a correlation of miRNA levels with oncogenic progression.

Accordingly, a study was conducted to evaluate the effects of BSFL as a protein supplement in beef steers. Six steers (603 ± 20 kg of BW, n = 3 and 404 ± 17 kg of BW, n = 3) consuming King Ranch bluestem hay (6.55% dry matter [DM] crude protein [CP]) ad libitum were used in two simultaneous 3 × 3 Latin squares. Steers were provided one of three treatments each period: 1) a control with no supplement (CON), 2) a supplement comprised of conventional feed ingredients with whole cottonseed and soybean meal as the main protein sources (CONV), and 3) a supplement with BSFL as the main protein source (BSFL). Three 14-d periods were conducted with 8 d to adapt to treatments, 5 d to measure intake and digestion, and 1 d to complete a ruminal fermentation profile. DM, organic matter (OM), CP, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent insoluble ash were determined in forage, supplement, ort, and fecal samples. Protein supplementation as CONV or BSFL stimulated forage OM intake (P ≤ 0.01) relative to CON with a trend for a difference (P = 0.08) between the supplements such that CONV steers consumed more FOMI than BSFL steers. Treatment affected total digestible OM intake (TDOMI; P ≤ 0.01); TDOMI for CON steers was 47.5 g/kg metabolic body weight (MBW) which was significantly less (P ≤ 0.01) than that of CONV or BSFL steers. Steers supplemented with CONV consumed significantly more TDOMI than BSFL steers (P = 0.05; 62.2 vs. 60.1 g/kg MBW, respectively).

Although empirical support for the theory has been widely demonstrated using property and violent crime data, the body of literature examining the theory’s applicability to intimate partner violence (IPV) is more limited. Further, much of the existing literature in this area applies the theory’s macro-level variables to individual outcomes instead of assessing community effects. Using negative binomial regression to analyze incident data from the Austin (TX) Police Department and demographic information from the United States Census Bureau, this study assesses the relationship between concentrated disadvantage, racial/ethnic heterogeneity, residential instability, and the geographic distribution of IPV incidents in a major U.S. city with no racial or ethnic majority. The independent variables of interest were constructed using principal axis factoring, and a spatial lag variable was included in the model to control for spatial clustering. The analysis showed that concentrated disadvantage was significantly, positively associated with annual counts of IPV incidents in neighborhoods, as was the control variable total crime reports. These results demonstrate that the geographic distribution of IPV is influenced by community factors. They underscore the importance of considering community-wide prevention and intervention efforts in tandem with individual services to those impacted by IPV.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/08862605221092070",""

Objective: To describe the clinical manifestations and associated etiologies and outcomes of dogs with EV. Animals: Twenty‐five client‐owned dogs with EV diagnosed via computed tomography (CT), endoscopy, or fluoroscopy. Methods: Retrospective case series. Cases were identified by review of the hospital imaging records database between 2010 and 2020. Signalment, clinical signs, and outcomes were documented. When present, additional collateral vasculature was also recorded. Cases were subcategorized into suspected etiology based upon the anatomic location or absence of an attributable underlying disease process, as well as the direction of blood flow. Results: Twenty‐four of 25 cases were identified via CT, with a prevalence of 0.012% (24/1950 total studies). Presenting clinical signs were nonspecific, and more likely because of the underlying cause as opposed to complications secondary to EV themselves. Etiologic anatomic locations were similar in occurrence between the abdomen (N = 14) and thorax (N = 11). All cases with an abdominal etiologic location had presumed or confirmed portal hypertension and 9/11 cases with a thoracic etiologic location had pulmonary, caval, or systemic hypertension.

Existing studies suggest that higher levels of positive religious coping are associated with higher levels of hope, and more frequent experiences with negative religious coping are associated with lower levels of hope. However, the relationship between religious coping and hope is underexamined among one of the most religious dyads in the U.S., older African American couples. This study utilizes data from 194 older African American couples (146 married and 48 cohabiting), with each partner between the age of 50 and 86 years, to examine the dyadic relationship between religious coping and hope. Actor Partner Interdependence Models revealed that men’s religious coping was associated with their own hope, and women’s religious coping was associated with their own hope. One unexpected partner effect was identified and found that women’s positive religious coping was negatively associated with men’s hope.

A steam-flaked corn-based fishing diet was offered ad libitum once daily containing the following treatments: 1) Control, in which no direct fed microbial (DFM) was offered (lactose as carrier only); 2 and 3) Probiotic mixtures at distinct concentrations [Mixture A and B, at 2g/animal-daily (lactose used as carrier)]. Orts DM were quantified daily and subtracted from total dietary DM offered to calculate DM intake. Two-day consecutive unshrunk BW were recorded before feeding on d 0, 30, 60, 90, 121, and 153 (prior to shipment to a federally inspected slaughter facility). Data were analyzed using the GLIMMIX procedure of SAS and pen was considered the experimental unit, in which F-test protected pre-planned contrasts comparing control versus DFM mixture-A and control versus DFM mixture-B were used. Steers offered mixture-A increased carcass-adjusted ADG (P = 0.03) by 6.7%, gain efficiency (P &lt; 0.01) by 6%, tended to increase carcass-adjusted final BW (P = 0.07) by 15kg and hot carcass weight (P = 0.07) by 10kg. The overall (d 0 to end) DM intake (P = 0.36) was not affected by treatment; however, a subtle (1.2%) decrease (P &lt; 0.01) during the initial 30 days for steers offered DFM mixture-B was observed. Carcass variables (dressing percentage, 12th rib fat, longissimus muscle area, marbling, yield grade, and liver scores) were not affected (P ≥ 0.13) by treatments. Growth performance was improved with DFM mixture-A which seemed to positively affect carcass weight without inducing deleterious effects on other carcass characteristics.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/100/Supplement_3/161/45963170/skac247.300.pdf",""

Although the causative factors for the national outbreak of electronic-cigarette, or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) has not been established, CDC reported that vitamin E acetate (VEA) is strongly linked to the EVALI outbreak. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that VEA vaping causes acute lung injury in a dose-dependent manner in a sheep model. Methods: Sheep were surgically prepared under anesthesia and analgesia with multiple vascular catheters (pulmonary arterial, left atrial, and femoral arterial). To assess pulmonary edema, the mediastinal lymph node vessel draining the lung was cannulated. After a 5-day surgical recovery, a tracheostomy tube and urinary catheter were placed. Then, the sheep were placed on a mechanical ventilator and VEA vaping was immediately started in the following groups: (1) vaped with glycerol (n=1); (2) vaped with 0.4mg of VEA (n=2); (3) vaped with 0.6mg of VEA (n=1); (4) vaped with 0.8mg of VEA (n=7); and (5) not injured, not treated (Sham, n=6). Sheep were resuscitated with lactated Ringer’s solution (4mL/kg/hr). Sheep in a conscious state was monitored with 4 hrs intervals for cardiopulmonary variables for 48 hrs. Results: Pulmonary gas exchange, represented by the PaO2/FiO2 ratio, was unchanged in sham, glycerol, and 0.4 mg VEA groups. In the 0.6 VEA group, the PaO2/FiO2 ratio was decreased from 42 to 48 hrs, while in the 0.8 mg VEA group, it was strongly decreased starting at 24 hrs and remained low throughout the remaining period. Lung lymph flow, an index of pulmonary microvascular permeability, was increased more than 2-fold in 0.6 and 0.8 mg VEA groups. Lung compliance also tended to decrease in all VEA groups. Conclusions: VEA vaping causes acute lung injury in a dose-dependent manner in sheep. Further studies should investigate underlying mechanistic aspects that cause increased microvascular permeability.","https://academic.oup.com/jbcr/article-pdf/43/Supplement_1/S67/42979607/irac012.105.pdf",""

Despite chromosomal and genetic heterogeneity, AML are uniformly characterized by increased reliance on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). This key metabolic hallmark of leukemia was recently reported as a feature of resistance to Cytarabine (AraC)-based therapy. Also, an aggressive phenotype and poor response to chemotherapy is associated with increased levels of Bcl-2. Despite the introduction of the Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax (VEN), the overall survival, particularly in older patients, remains poor. Thus, approaches to improve the sensitivity of leukemic cells to AraC-based or Bcl-2 based therapies are urgently needed.Here, we investigated the preclinical activity of ME-344, a novel isoflavone OXPHOS inhibitor, on AML cell lines and relapsed/refractory (R/R) patient samples in vitro and examined the efficacy of ME-344 in combination with VEN in Ara-C sensitive and resistant AML cell lines and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) both in vitro and in vivo.ME-344 (0-300 nM, 24 hr) significantly reduced viability of AML cell lines with EC50 of 75-100 nM and R/R AML patient samples with EC50 of 200-300 nM respectively. The cytotoxic response in AML was enhanced when ME-344 was combined with VEN, producing strong synergistic viability reduction and induction of apoptosis, as evidenced by Annexin V assay and an increased level of cleaved caspase 3 and PARP (immunoblotting). The dual inhibition of OXPHOS/Bcl-2 reduced Mcl-1 levels and showed efficacy in Mcl-1 overexpressingand Ara-C resistant AML models.Functional metabolic characterization of AML by transcriptomics and mass spectrometry demonstrated that ME-344 effectively inhibited biosynthetic pathways of nucleotides uncovering the purine biosynthesis pathway as crucial for therapeutic efficacy. ME-344 induced a dose-dependent decrease in the oxygen consumption rate (by Seahorse assay), in both AraC-sensitive and -resistant AML cell lines, and in R/R AML patient samples, which was further significantly potentiated by combination with VEN.Finally, in an aggressive AML xenograft model, ME-344 (200 mpk, i.v.) combined with subtherapeutic doses of VEN (25 mpk) reduced circulating leukemia burden and extended survival. Ongoing in vivo studies in AML PDX models will address the impact of ME-344 in the context of acquired AraC- and Bcl-2- resistance.

Hypothesis:: The authors hypothesized that sex- and age-based patterns in youth gymnastics–related injuries exist, which are otherwise overlooked in an unstratified population. Study Design:: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods:: Publicly available injury data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System were collected on pediatric gymnastics injuries presenting to emergency departments in the United States. Participation data from the National Sporting Goods Association were used to calculate national injury incidence rates in 7- to 11-year-olds (childhood) and 12- to 17-year-olds (adolescence) from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2018. Z tests were conducted for the comparison of injury rates between girls and boys within each age group and for overall injury rate across age groups. Results:: Girls participated in gymnastics at a frequency 6.5 times that of boys in childhood and 13.5 times that of boys in adolescence. An estimated 72,542 youth gymnastics–related injuries were reported in US emergency departments each year. A large proportion (61.3%) occurred in childhood, with female predominance in both age groups. Overall, there was no difference in weighted annual injury rate (injuries per 100,000 athlete-days per year) by age group (6.9 [childhood] vs 8.8 [adolescence]; P = .19) or sex (7.4 [girls] vs 8.1 [boys]; P = .65). In adolescence, boys were more likely than girls to experience injury (16.47 vs 8.2; P = .003). Wrist and lower arm fractures were more common in childhood than adolescence (1.07 vs 0.43; P = .002) and specifically in girls (childhood vs adolescence, 1.06 vs 0.37; P = .001). Ankle injuries and concussions were more common in adolescence vs childhood ( P = .01 and .0002). Conclusion:: Upper extremity injuries predominated among childhood gymnasts, particularly girls. In adolescence, girls and boys experienced increases in concussions and foot and ankle injuries. Although representing a lower overall number of training gymnasts as compared with girls, adolescent boys experience a higher rate of injuries overall.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/23259671221102478",""

This study evaluated the effects of dietary melatonin supplementation during gestation on fetal hepatic circadian regulatory and metabolic gene expression. Twenty-four pregnant sows were randomly assigned to either melatonin (20mg/d; MEL) or control (CON) and 0500h (AM) or 1700h (PM) harvest timepoint across fall and spring replicates. The fall replicate occurred from gestational day 38±1 to 99±1, while spring was days 41 to 106±1. At harvest small, medium, and large piglets were identified by body weight and their livers were collected. Data were analyzed using a linear mixed model by the MIXED procedure of SAS. Cry1 expression tended to increase (P=0.0575) in large fetuses compared to small during the fall, while large fetuses had the greatest expression, medium intermediary, and small least during the spring (P=0.0056). Cry2 was reduced (P&lt; 0.001) in MEL offspring compared to CON in the fall. There was a Treatment × Class interaction (P=0.0104) for Cry2 expression during spring wherein, CON-AM was reduced compared to CON-PM, however no differences between MEL groups. A Treatment × Class interaction (P=0.0511) of Per2 expression was present in the fall, where expression of small control fetuses was reduced compared to remaining controls. Spring Per2 expression increased (P=0.0122) in large fetuses compared to other sizes, Per2 also increased (P=0.0039) in PM compared to AM. Fall IGF1 expression increased (P=0.0366) in large fetuses compared to medium and small, and spring IGF1 expression increased (P=0.0067) in large fetuses compared to small. These findings suggest that maternal melatonin supplementation during gestation modulates expression of hepatic circadian regulatory and metabolic genes which may impact growth and developmental efficiency postnatally in a seasonal manner.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/100/Supplement_3/323/45963695/skac247.590.pdf",""

Its expression was found to be upregulated in endothelial cells (ECs) under cardiovascular disease conditions. Since the role of MCU in regulating cytosolic Ca2+ (cCa2+) homeostasis in ECs exposed to shear stress (SS) is unknown, we studied mCa2+ dynamics (that is known to decode cCa2+ signaling) in sheared ECs. To understand cause-and-effect, we ectopically expressed MCU in ECs. A higher percentage of MCU-transduced ECs exhibited mCa2+ transients/oscillations, and at higher frequency, under SS compared to sheared control ECs.Transients/oscillations correlated with mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) flashes and mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) flickers, and depended on activation of the mechanosensitive Piezo1 channel and the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). A positive feedback loop composed of mCa2+ uptake/mROS flashes/ΔΨm flickers and endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release, in association with Piezo1 and eNOS, provided insights into the mechanism by which SS, under conditions of high MCU activity, may shape vascular EC energetics and function.","https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2026367/v1",""

The pandemic has been disruptive but offers the opportunity to learn about ways to support students in other situations where abrupt changes to teaching and learning are necessary. Purpose/Hypothesis: We described the responses of engineering and computer science students to a series of prompts about their experiences with remote learning. Design/Method: Data about students' remote learning experiences were collected from undergraduate engineering and computer science students at four different universities through an end‐of‐semester survey. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and qualitative responses were analyzed using qualitative content analysis through the lenses of master narrative theory and sociocultural theory. Results: Student responses revealed how their individual circumstances combined to reduce motivation, create home environments detrimental to completing schoolwork, and increase stress. Many students described the negative impacts of remote learning, but some students found positive aspects of the situation. The majority of students did not indicate a change in their desire or plans to pursue engineering or computer science majors. Conclusions: There was wide variation in how students experienced the disruption to university learning during Spring 2020. Implications of this paper can help not only in cases where emergency remote learning is needed in the future but also as universities seek to return to “normal” operations in 2022 and beyond.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jee.20473",""

To validate individual animal intake, 30 cows were allowed access to 3 portable units (2 feeding bins/unit) for 6 hours. Feed in each bin was removed and weighed in an external scale at the end of each cow visit. To validate total feed disappearance, 75 cows were assigned to 1 of 3 pastures equipped with a portable unit. Feed disappearance over 24 h was assessed manually over 21 consecutive days using an external scale. Ten cows per pasture were randomly selected and identified to facilitate collection of video observational data. Two trained observers recorded animal identification and start and end times for a visit (n = 480 minutes/day; 3 days). When regressing the EO and DO results within individual cow visit, a linear fit was detected (P &lt; 0.01; r2 = 0.95). Methods were very strongly correlated (r = 0.91) when all visits were analyzed but decreased to strong (r = 0.78) when DO intake was ≤ 0.1 kg. When regressing the EO and DO results for total feed disappearance, a linear fit was detected (P &lt; 0.01; r2 = 0.97) as DO total feed disappearance increased the EO output linearly increased. For observational data, Cohen’s kappa coefficient for agreement between DO and EO was considered strong (0.96). The sensitivity of EO in yielding true positive results was 97%, whereas specificity in yielding true negative results was 99%. These results indicate the portable, self-contained feeding units utilized herein are sufficiently effective for detecting cow presence at a bunk and measurement of feed consumption.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/100/Supplement_3/298/45963592/skac247.543.pdf",""

To discover student perceptions relating to this question, I used a mixed-methods approach in which I surveyed 117 students and then interviewed 10 survey participants. Survey and interview questions were based on utilitarian versus deontological ethics with an emphasis on whether exaggerating diversity in recruitment materials is ethl. The results of this exploratory study showed that most students believe using a disproportionate amount of diversity in recruitment materials is unethical. Student participants who identified as a person from an underrepresented racial/ethnic group indicated that it is unethical to exaggerate diversity in recruitment materials at a higher percentage than their white counterparts.

Bos indicus beef heifers (n=25) were subjected to embryo transfer on day 7 with IVP embryos, and pregnancies were confirmed at slaughter. Heifers were harvested on days 25 (n=8) and 36 (n=8), and samples from endometrium (END) and trophectoderm (TE) were collected for RNA isolation using a commercial extraction kit (QIAGEN; Hilden, Germany). Plasma concentrations of PAGs were determined via validated ELISA and the females were classified in groups of high and low PAG (6.8±0.7 (n=4) vs. 0.8±0.7 (n=4) ng/mL on D25 and 15±2.1 (n=5) vs. 4±1.2 (n=3) ng/mL on D36; P&lt; 0.05). An Illumina platform was utilized for RNA sequencing. Differentially expressed genes between groups and by tissue were determined using edge-R package from R. Gene ontology analyses revealed a down regulation of processes associated with embryonic and placenta development on D36 in both TE and END for the low PAG group. On D25 and D36, markers of attachment, ECM remodeling and invasion were significantly upregulated in the TE, but not in the END of the low PAG pregnancies. PAG genes were not differentially expressed between groups. In conclusion, heifers with low PAG in peripheral circulation have significantly different gene expression profiles in the developing conceptus and endometrium. The results suggested abnormal maternal-conceptus interactions initiated on D25, which may have resulted in poor embryonic and placenta development on D36. Disturbances at the maternal-conceptus interface could be impairing PAGs from reaching the maternal peripheral circulation, since no differences in PAG genes were found between PAG groups.

Historically, the occurrence of GBM is higher in male than in female of reproductive age. Usage of exogenous hormones are known to reduce the risk of glioma development and estrogen improves survival in a glioblastoma animal models, suggesting a potential protective role in GBM. Estrogen receptor β (ERβ) may play a role as a tumor suppressor in GBM, and interestingly its expression decreases in higher-grade tumor samples with loss of differentiation. Therefore, a selective ERβ agonist could be a potential therapy against GBM. OSU-ERb-12 is brain penetrant, orally bioavailable ERβ agonist and demonstrates selectivity of ERβ: ERα = 46:1.

Preoperative and postoperative gabapentin is often included within multimodal analgesia because it has been shown to reduce postoperative opioid use. However, the role of gabapentin has been questioned because of concerns of adverse effects, particularly in the elderly. In an effort to better understand the specific role of gabapentin within the context of an established enhanced recovery after surgery protocol, the authors studied the prevalence of its adverse effects in patients undergoing abdominal wall reconstruction. Methods:: Following institutional review board approval, a retrospective review of a prospectively collected database of 267 consecutive patients who underwent abdominal wall reconstruction performed by a single surgeon was conducted. Demographic variables; operative details; postoperative analgesic use; the presence of dizziness, lightheadedness, or altered mental status; hypotension; negative Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale scores; and postoperative falls were recorded and analyzed according to postoperative gabapentin administration. Results:: Two hundred thirteen patients (80 percent) met inclusion criteria, of which 138 (65 percent) received postoperative gabapentin. Postoperative gabapentin use was not associated with dizziness, lightheadedness, or altered mental status; hypotension; negative Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale scores; or falls. Furthermore, even among those aged 65 years or older, postoperative gabapentin use was not significantly associated with these adverse events. Conclusions:: In patients undergoing abdominal wall reconstruction, postoperative gabapentin administration was not associated with an increase in adverse effects. Further prospective analysis may better allow the characterization of the adverse effects of perioperative gabapentin.

Additional properties of the synapse beyond multiple weights can be needed, and can depend on the application, requiring the need for generating different synapse behaviors from the same materials. Here, we measure artificial synapses based on magnetic materials that use a magnetic tunnel junction and a magnetic domain wall. By fabricating lithographic notches in a domain wall track underneath a single magnetic tunnel junction, we achieve 4-5 stable resistance states that can be repeatably controlled electrically using spin orbit torque. We analyze the effect of geometry on the synapse behavior, showing that a trapezoidal device has asymmetric weight updates with high controllability, while a straight device has higher stochasticity, but with stable resistance levels. The device data is input into neuromorphic computing simulators to show the usefulness of application-specific synaptic functions. Implementing an artificial neural network applied on streamed Fashion-MNIST data, we show that the trapezoidal magnetic synapse can be used as a metaplastic function for efficient online learning. Implementing a convolutional neural network for CIFAR-100 image recognition, we show that the straight magnetic synapse achieves near-ideal inference accuracy, due to the stability of its resistance levels. This work shows multi-weight magnetic synapses are a feasible technology for neuromorphic computing and provides design guidelines for emerging artificial synapse technologies.","https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1104630/v1",""

We used interference reflection microscopy to make improved measurements of microtubule growth rates and growth fluctuations in the presence and absence of GTP hydrolysis. In the absence of GTP hydrolysis, microtubules grew steadily with very low fluctuations. These data were best described by a computational model implementing slow assembly kinetics, such that the rate of microtubule elongation is primarily limited by the rate of αβ-tubulin associations. With GTPase present, microtubules displayed substantially larger growth fluctuations than expected based on the no GTPase measurements. Our modeling showed that these larger fluctuations occurred because exposure of GDP-tubulin on the microtubule end transiently ‘poisoned’ growth, yielding a wider range of growth rates compared to GTP only conditions. Our experiments and modeling point to slow association kinetics (strong longitudinal interactions), such that drugs and regulatory proteins that alter microtubule dynamics could do so by modulating either the association or dissociation rate of tubulin from the microtubule tip.

Building upon and extending strategic leadership theory, we develop and empirically test a theoretical model of the interactive effects of the intensity of TMT joint problem solving and level of TMT interdependence on quality of TMT strategy implementation coordination and firm performance. Using data collected from TMTs in 83 firms, our results show that the: intensity of TMT joint problem solving is positively related to quality of TMT strategy implementation coordination; interaction between the intensity of TMT joint problem solving and the level of TMT interdependence attenuates the positive influence of each on quality of TMT strategy implementation coordination, demonstrating a substitution effect; and, quality of TMT strategy implementation coordination mediates the relationship between the interaction and firm performance.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/joms.12838",""

However, to date, no published research has compared non-treatment and treatment-seeking EMS professionals in the same greater metropolitan area. In this study, we examined differences and similarities among the non-treatment-seeking EMS professionals (<em>n </em>= 57) from a local EMS agency and treatment-seeking EMS personnel (<em>n </em>= 53) from a non-profit community treatment center on six assessment instruments that measure attachment avoidance, attachment anxiety, resilience, depression, generalized anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and suicidality. The Mann-Whitney U test revealed attachment avoidance, attachment anxiety, depression, generalized anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were significantly higher in the treatment-seeking sample compared to the non-treatment-seeking group. Resilience and suicide did not significantly differ. Correlational analyses revealed that the most consistent findings for both samples were PTSD, depression, and generalized anxiety. Findings suggest that negative affect may underlie these three constructs, regardless of whether the individual is treatment-seeking or not. These findings are conceptualized through three different theoretical frameworks: attachment, resilience, and negative affect. We also make recommendations for EMS agencies and suggest future scholarship based on these preliminary findings.","https://scholarworks.waldenu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1527&amp;context=jsbhs&amp;unstamped=1",""

It shows that changes in the bond can contribute to changes in delinquency through three sequences, each with a unique over-time pattern that depends on how bond agents respond to delinquency.

Mechanical properties (e.g., tensile strength, flexural strength, and Charpy impact strength), thermal conductivity, and radiation shielding properties (e.g., gamma radiation and neutron radiation) of the specimens were determined. The results revealed that the specimens containing barite and magnetite managed to exhibit adequate mechanical properties (especially Charpy impact strength). Among different filler materials used, barite‐filled specimens outperformed colemanite and magnetite‐filled specimens in terms of mechanical properties. The mechanical performance of filler‐modified specimens can be further enhanced by adopting efficient dispersion techniques to disperse filler material and SWCNTs throughout the composite plates. The thermal conductivity of barite, magnetite, and colemanite‐filled specimens (with/without SWCNTs) increased by 30.56%–60% as compared to specimens only containing SWCNTs and neat polymer, which avoids the accumulation of heat required for radiation shielding applications. Similar to thermal conductivity, specimens containing filler materials (with and without SWCNTs) provided higher gamma and neutron radiation shielding properties as compared to neat polymer‐ and SWCNT‐modified specimens. In the case of gamma and neutron radiation shielding, barite‐ and colemanite‐filled specimens provided better results, respectively.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/app.53483",""

I argue that appealing to aesthetic commitments allows us to account for the existence of aesthetic obligations as well as their grounding.

This report describes a computer algorithm for such classification and presents results using data from the Texas Birth Defects Registry (TBDR). Methods: Each of the 1,041 birth defects coded by the TBDR was classified as chromosomal, syndromic, minor, or “needs review” by a group of three clinical geneticists. A SAS program applied those classifications to each birth defect in a case (child/fetus), and then hierarchically combined them to obtain one summary classification for each case, adding isolated and multiple defect categories. The program was applied to 136,121 cases delivered in 2012–2017. Results: Of total cases, 49% were classified by the platform as isolated (having only one major birth defect). This varied widely by birth defect; of those examined, the highest proportion classified as isolated was found in pyloric stenosis (87.6%), whereas several cardiovascular malformations had low proportions, including tricuspid valve atresia/stenosis (2.3%). Discussion: This is one of the first and largest attempts to identify the proportion of isolated cases across a broad spectrum of birth defects, which can inform future epidemiologic and genomic studies of these phenotypes. Our approach is designed for easy modification for use with any birth defects coding system and category definitions, allowing scalability for different studies or birth defects registries, which often do not have resources for individual clinical review of all case records.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/bdr2.1990",""

Many Americans have seen information on social media that they find confusing (Mitchell, Oliphant & Shearer, 2020) and recent research has found that social media use may contribute to greater likelihoods of believing misinformation about the virus and sharing ‘fake news’ about it (Su, 2021; Pennycook et al., 2020).

The present study also identified the credibility cues that people look to as they are trying to ascertain the veracity of COVID-19 information they come across on social media and that are predictors of helping them feel more confident in their own ability to identify credible information. Those significant cues—believability, authenticity, trustworthiness, reliability and objectivity—confirm previous research by Appelman and Sundar (2016) and Tandoc et al. (2018b).

Thus, justice is likely to vary in both how much it is received and the employee reactions it engenders. In order to understand the range of justice responses, we develop a dynamic theory of justice by using person-environment fit to take both the value that an individual places in justice and the justice they received into account. Using this framework, we clarify the consequences of congruence versus incongruence in daily justice received and valued, which have implications for treatment discrepancies and subsequent work behavior. We also identify the differences between excess and deficient justice on cognitive and affective responses to justice. Our findings reveal that employees’ experience of justice is more complicated than simply whether the justice they received was high or low on a particular day. Using experience sampling and polynomial regression methods, we observe that not all instances in which employees receive high levels of justice are equivalent. In fact, we find that, depending on justice valued, receiving high levels of justice can be just as detrimental as receiving low levels. Additionally, we find that although both forms of justice misfit (excess and deficiency) cause-negative work outcomes, they affect these outcomes through differential responses to justice — with excess causing increased rumination and deficiency causing decreased positive affect. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for extant justice theory and for supervisor-employee work interactions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/orsc.2021.1496",""

In the first study, Angus bulls (n=5) were used to evaluate the effect of different insemination doses (10, 20 and 40 million sperm/dose) on pregnancy/fixed-time AI (P/FTAI; cows n=4,866). The interaction between insemination dose and bull was not significant (P=0.53), and there was no effect of insemination dose on P/FTAI (P=0.31); however, there was an effect of bull on P/FTAI (P &lt;0.01). Two bulls had high, one bull had average, and two bulls had low fertility. Post-thaw sperm analysis was performed by computer assisted sperm analysis (CASA) and flow cytometry; however, analysis performed could not explain field fertility differences. In a second study, Angus and Angus crosses bulls were used to investigate differences in sperm longevity between epididymal and ejaculated sperm. Epididymal and ejaculated semen was incubated at pH 5.8, 6.8, or 7.3. Proteins in epididymal fluid, seminal plasma, and proteins loosely attached to epididymal and ejaculated sperm were also investigated. It was identified that epididymal sperm maintained viability longer compared to ejaculated sperm regardless of media pH (P &lt;0.05). Ejaculated sperm had increased longevity (total motility &gt;20%) at pH 6.8 compared to pH 5.8 or 7.3. There were 458 unique proteins between all samples; 311 and 178 in epididymal fluid and seminal plasma, respectively, and 334 and 298 on epididymal and ejaculated sperm, respectively. Based on comparative proteomics, epididymal sperm energy metabolism is more glycolytic compared to ejaculated sperm. In addition, there were greater numbers of antioxidants available for epididymal sperm likely to maintain reactive oxygen species (ROS) at low concentrations to inhibit premature sperm activation. From this dataset, three proteins that are associated with cell-to-cell interaction were studied [plasma serine protease inhibitor (SERPINA5), dystroglycan (DAG1), and CD9]. Among dairy bulls, SERPINA5 and DAG1 were not associated with field fertility; thus, they are not potential fertility markers. The protein CD9 was evaluated to determine whether induction of sperm capacitation (in vitro) could be used to estimate/predict bulls fertility differences. Semen samples from first study were evaluated for total motility (CASA), and functional sperm analysis (flow cytometry) at pre-wash, post-wash, h 0, 3, 6, and 24 of incubation. Sperm analysis were not able to estimate fertility differences between high and average fertility bulls; however, low fertility bulls had decreased (P &lt;0.05) viability, zinc signature 2, and zinc signature1 + 2, and had increased (P &lt;0.05) dead CD9+ sperm. In summary, the use of an insemination dose of 10-40 million sperm can generate acceptable P/FTAI, and evaluation of CD9, viability and zinc signatures may increase the industry’s ability to estimate fertility of bulls that pass a BSE.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/100/Supplement_3/200/45962709/skac247.365.pdf",""

These methods intelligently overcome the sparsity in individual data by seeking temporal commonality among users’ heterogeneous location behaviors. The advantages of our models are highlighted through experiments on several real-world mobility data sets, which also show how our methods can realize the three analytical purposes in a unified manner.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/ijoc.2021.1098",""

While existing scholarship has so far treated apologies and restitution of looted art restitution as separate ways of atonement, this paper investigates both as indicators of a country's norm change toward postcolonial reconciliation and justice. The paper analyzes the political debates in France and Germany surrounding apologies and art restitution as instances of belated “coming to terms” with their colonial past. I argue that both form part of a broader societal change surrounding a state's history and its current identity. In response to increasing demands for apologies and restitution from African states, changing international norms of addressing colonial violence, and domestic mobilization, both states have made slow and incomplete progress toward postcolonial reconciliation and justice. They have agreed to return certain objects and apologized for specific colonial atrocities, albeit not for colonialism writ large. Ultimately, the debates highlight how these transitional justice forms each come with their own political, legal, and cultural challenges that complicate and delay engagement with the past. It was ultimately various social pressures from within and outside, in the form of lawsuits by victim groups and official demands for apology and restitution, that led to domestic mobilization toward more open engagement with colonial pasts.","https://academic.oup.com/isagsq/article-pdf/2/4/ksac053/46385529/ksac053.pdf",""

By analyzing the RIMS's log data, we identified 11 tasks researchers performed when updating their profiles. These tasks were further grouped into three activities: (a) adding publication, (b) enhancing researcher identity, and (c) improving research discoverability. In addition, we found that junior researchers and female researchers were more engaged in maintaining their RIMS profiles than senior researchers and male researchers. The results provide insights for designing profile maintenance action templates for institutional RIMS that are tailored to researchers' characteristics and help enhance researchers' engagement in the curation of their research information.

While built through books, essays, journal articles, and speeches, her intellectual legacy has seldom been recognized as academic by contemporary audiences. Yet, over the last 40 years, her contributions to sociology, philosophy, conceptions of democracy, inquiry, feminism, care ethics, community engagement, social ethics, community engagement, peace, municipal governance, social justice, and more have emerged and received traction in the scholarly literature. The Oxford Handbook of Jane Addams is a selective collection of original analyses offered by an international group of social and political theorists who have contributed to the burgeoning field of Addams Studies. This Handbook is a testament to the maturity of contemporary Jane Addams studies. Less than a half-century ago, such a scholarly collection would have been considered unwarranted. Despite intellectually influencing her contemporaries, Addams was marginalized as an original thinker for much of the 20th century. Today, a resurgence of academic work led by feminist scholars such as Mary Jo Deegan and Charlene Haddock Seigfried has restored Addams to her rightful place as an essential intellectual pioneer with ongoing significance. This collection pays particular attention to her contributions to scholarly fields of sociology and philosophy as well as to more professional disciplines of public administration and social work. Furthermore, this volume signifies Addams’s global impact as scholars from all over the world contribute to the tapestry of her intellectual legacy. The 38 chapters in this volume are divided into six sections: Addams, Democracy and Social Theory; Addams and Her Contemporaries; Addams Across Disciplines; Addams, Peace and International Relations; Addams on Knowledge and Methods; and Addams and Social Practice. A major focus of the Oxford Handbook of Jane Addams is how Addams’s insights remain relevant when confronting today’s social challenges.","",""

Yet, the iterative nature between control building trust and trust impacting control is poorly understood. Early formation of trust in work relationships is important because it pervades future interactions and trust‐building attempts, and we join this conversation by examining how workgroups can actively constrain newcomer behaviour through control to build trust during socialization. Specifically, our theory building focuses on the unofficial socialization practice of workgroup hazing to explore how workgroups can systematically force a circumstance in which newcomers must demonstrate their trustworthiness to the workgroup before they can be trusted as insiders of the group. Through this process, the perceived trustworthiness of newcomers affects how the workgroup subsequently controls them. By examining the perspective of the workgroup, we uncover two key mechanisms that impact these control‐trust dynamics in how workgroups often socialize newcomers: (1) there is a shift in vulnerability from the workgroup to the newcomer, and (2) person‐group fit serves as a proxy for the trustworthiness of the newcomer. We conclude with an agenda for future control‐trust research given our theory building.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/joms.12879",""

Being informed of the age-related increased risks could help older drivers form compensatory strategies and determine when to seek further help to stay on the road safely for longer. Using a self-report assessment tool, the Attentional Failure during Driving Questionnaire (AFDQ), we examined older drivers’ experience of various attentional failures during daily driving and how the measures could predict their crash risks. Methods: We used a new methodological approach distinguishing the occurrences of attentional failures during driving and the frequency of those occurrences. The individuals’ AFDQ occurrence and frequency scores were compared with prior driving outcomes and simulated driving performance. Results: Unlike middle-aged drivers, frequency rather than occurrence of attentional failures was a significant predictor of prior traffic violations and crashes among older drivers. Also, attentional failures, but not chronological age, predicted older drivers’ crash risks. AFDQ frequency was also associated with older drivers’ poorer performance in simulated driving. Discussion: The findings suggest that the self-report assessment for attention-related driving failures can predict older drivers’ crash risks. Furthermore, the two-part approach of AFDQ provides an opportunity to do a more comprehensive investigation of the associations between attentional declines and crash risks among older drivers.","https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/geronb/gbac077/44659609/gbac077.pdf",""

To address this, in this study, six mixes containing lightweight expanded clay aggregates with a small quantity of hooked steel fibers ranging from 0 to 1.15 vol% are produced. As a result, it is found that the inclusion of steel fibers at 1.15 vol% can increase fracture energy and characteristic length by about 20 and 11 times, respectively. The result of this study is found to be significant and point to the development of highly ductile, structural‐grade lightweight fiber reinforced concrete through the use of hooked steel fibers.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/suco.202200107",""

The results confirm the expected effect of race/ethnicity on confidence in the police, net of neighborhood contexts and respondents’ demographics. More importantly, we found that the three measures tapping into the quality of police treatment during police–resident encounters partially mediate the race/ethnicity effect on views of police. Perceived equal treatment emerged as having the strongest effect. When the combined race/ethnicity sample was divided into three racial/ethnic subsamples, perceived equal treatment exerted the largest effects on confidence in the police both within and across the groups.

However, due to the spatial and temporal heterogeneity and complex hydrological processes in karst systems, predicting karst spring discharge remains challenging. In this study, three deep learning‐based models, including long short‐term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU) and simple recurrent neural network (RNN), are framed with an encoder–decoder architecture to provide multiple‐step‐ahead spring discharge prediction. The encoder–decoder architecture includes an encoder that reads and encodes the input sequence into a vector and decoder that deciphers the vector and outputs the predicted sequence. Three hybrid models called LSTM‐ED, GRU‐ED and simple RNN‐ED are compared with single‐step models and multiple‐step models without the encoder–decoder architecture to investigate the role of the encoder–decoder architecture on multi‐step‐ahead prediction. The sensitivity of the selection of input time and lead time steps on the karst spring discharge prediction is evaluated. The predicted results are compared with the observed spring discharge. It implies that: (1) LSTM‐ED, GRU‐ED and RNN‐ED models obtain similar results on predicting karst spring discharge multiple time steps ahead; (2) three hybrid multiple‐step models outperform the single‐step models in making consistent and accurate spring discharge predictions; (3) the multiple‐step models framed with an encoder–decoder architecture obtain better spring discharge prediction results than the single‐step models and multiple‐step models without the encoder–decoder structure; (4) the LSTM‐ED, GRU‐ED and simple RNN‐ED models are sensitive to the selection of lead time and insensitive to the selection of input time step. A short lead time typically yields a more accurate spring discharge prediction.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hyp.14737",""

All animals were followed through the finishing phase in a commercial feedyard to investigate carryover effects on feedlot performance in 2 pens comingled across supplemental treatment. Carcass characteristics were evaluated via ultrasonography on d0 and d84 of finishing, and measurements were obtained at harvest. Feed DMI were segregated to individual animals according to Guiroy et al. (2001) and Tedeschi and Fox (2020b). Supplemented animals were heavier (P &lt; 0.01) at feedlot entry than FC, but harvest BW did not differ (P = 0.23). However, S and FS required 37 fewer days on feed (P = 0.01) than FC.

Thirty-two Californian rabbits, assigned randomly to one of four treatments, were used in a generalized complete block design experiment with two 35-d feeding periods. Treatments replaced soybean meal and alfalfa such that 0%, 25%, 50%, and 75% CP was replaced by HSM. Diets were isonitrogenous and contained 28% steam-flaked corn.

Rabbits were harvested after feeding periods, and stomach (S) and cecum (C) content sampling was conducted. Feed, orts, and fecal samples were assayed for DM and fiber fractions for digestibility determination. There was no effect of dietary treatment on DMD (52.5%; P = 0.05), NDFD (-29.5%; P = 0.54), or ADFD (-57.7%; P = 0.56).

Eight potentially toxic elements (PTEs), namely aluminum, chromium, copper, iron, manganese, nickel, lead, and zinc, were detected in rainwater samples, collected and analyzed from 54 sampling locations across the community. The elemental concentrations were quantified using atomic absorption spectrophotometry and compared using the regulatory standards of the World Health Organization, United States Environmental Protection Agency, and Nigerian Drinking Water Quality Standards. The PTEs detected in the rainwater samples can be attributed to the nature of the materials used in the roof catchment systems, storage tank conditions, anthropogenic effects from industrial and agricultural processes, and fossil fuel emissions. However, only 20% of the evaluated samples contained PTE concentrations below the allowable regulatory limits.

From this “finesse” of the problem of the geological time scales in sub‐glass temperature systems strong evidence that the divergence of the relaxation times at finite temperature from WLF‐types of extrapolation is not correct. The second topic is polymer nonlinear viscoelasticity as it relates to dynamic heterogeneity. We show results from mechanical hole burning experiments that suggest that dynamic heterogeneity arises from the nature of specific relaxation mechanisms rather than heterogeneous changes in, for example, the fictive temperature. Included is a discussion of large amplitude oscillatory shear testing and how it relates to characterization of nonlinear viscoelastic materials.

One, crafted by male reformers, was a reaction to corruption and inefficiencies of crony political hiring practices. Their goal was to separate politics and administration and uncover a science of administration. The second model, developed by settlement women, had a social justice reform agenda. These women, who themselves could not vote, advocated for children, women, and immigrants as they sought municipal (e.g., cleaner cities, playgrounds, juvenile justice) and industrial (e.g., safer workplaces, child labor laws) reform. Jane Addams led the effort and through her social democracy, social ethics, and feminist pragmatism provided a sound theoretical underpinning to the undertaking. The settlement model failed to receive recognition in the male-dominated field of public administration. In the early 2000s, public administration scholars rediscovered the buried settlement model, which contained two themes—municipal housekeeping and industrial citizenship. Of the two, industrial citizenship is less well articulated. This chapter describes industrial citizenship and Jane Addams’s role in its development.","https://academic.oup.com/edited-volume/41988/chapter/355435141",""

However, understanding what factors impact leader wisdom is still developing. In this paper, we rely on a fear‐based view of wisdom and empirically examine through a quantitative study of 249 leaders if one of the primary regulators of human behavior (fear) is positively related to wisdom. We are specifically focused on the role of fear of failure and wisdom. Additionally, because we recognize that fear has a negative connotation and has a tipping point regarding leader effectiveness, we propose that psychological empowerment serves as a coping mechanism for fear and mediates the relationship between fear of failure and wisdom. Through structural equation modeling (SEM), we demonstrate that fear of failure does positively impact leader wisdom and that this relationship is mediated by psychological empowerment. This study contributes to the literature by advancing the fear‐based view of wisdom which unites two of the most powerful concepts in human history: fear and wisdom. Although wisdom has a resurgence of interest in business literature, fear is not given much attention. By theoretically and empirically linking fear of failure with wisdom, we shed light on how fear is an important motivating mechanism. The study also contributes to practice by suggesting leaders should fear failure and avoid minimizing fears to be wise.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/beer.12497",""

Sensor technologies can identify behavioral trends, offering the potential to detect abnormal behavior associated with health status and animal welfare changes. The aim of recent studies was to investigate behavior deviations using tri-axial accelerometers and global positioning systems (GPS). Accelerometers were effective tools in determining behavior changes due to the onset of illnesses and parturition. Eight Brahman-cross heifers were fitted with accelerometers to study water consumption behavior. Two of the heifers were diagnosed with Bovine Ephemeral Fever, which symptoms include lameness and stiffness. Movement Intensity (MI), a metric calculated from accelerometer axis data, was lower (P ≤ 0.01) during the day of disease diagnosis compared to 48 h prior. Ten ewes were each fitted with HerdDogg biometric accelerometers, with five ewes also fitted with accelerometers to investigate behavior before and after illness caused by the unintentional feeding of mold-contaminated feedstuffs. Activity levels were lower for days 1 to 4 after feeding (P &lt; 0.05) than day -4 to 0 before feeding. Thirteen Debouillet ewes, with accelerometer ear tags, were used to determine the ability of random forest machine learning techniques to accurately identify and predict parturition-related behavior. Prediction models were able to predict seven mutually-exclusive behaviors and active vs. inactive behavior with 66.7% and 87.2% accuracy, respectively. The use of GPS tracking can help identify proper pasture rotation timing. Thirty-two and twenty-nine cattle were fitted with GPS collars in central Arizona to evaluate the temporal changes in association patterns on two herds of Corriente cattle managed under two different stocking densities: high stocking density (0.417 animal ha-1) and low stocking density (0.123 animals ha-1), respectively. Half-weight index (HWI) value was calculated for each pair of GPS-tracked cattle to determine the time cattle spent within 75 m and 500 m of others. Cattle within both pastures exhibited low mean association values (HWI &lt; 0.25) at both spatial scales at the beginning of the study with increasing levels of independence throughout the study. Cattle dispersed throughout the study (P &lt; 0.01) and traveled farther from water (P &lt; 0.01), likely in search of forages. The combination of GPS and accelerometers can improve detection of welfare issues. Seventeen cattle were tracked with both sensors and sixteen cattle tracked with only GPS across two years to determine the potential of detecting water system failures. Movement intensity was greater (P = 0.03) and cattle remained closer to water (P = 0.01) on the days of simulated water failure compared to control days. Real-time sensors have the potential to provide caretakers notification of changes in livestock behavior that can occur due to disease, parturition, or infrastructure failure.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/100/Supplement_3/197/45962715/skac247.362.pdf",""

Beef steers (n = 10) were tagged with Electronic RFID tags (EID) in an improved pasture (~12.1 hectares) containing Bermuda and Tall Fescue and inter-seeded with Annual Ryegrass and grazed from Feb. – Dec. 2020. Static chute weights (n = 80) were collected monthly, and a WOW system placed by the water to remotely collect BW (n = 5,466). Data were first loaded into Program R and scanned for spurious data using each of 2 primary approaches, 1) the whole herd and individual means ± 1 standard deviation (SD) calculated daily or over the entire trial and 2) each of 3 data smoothing algorithms, which included a quadratic growth model, cubic splines, and polynomial regression. Then, data with spurious observations removed were paired with static chute weights and fitted to a linear model to measure accuracy (mean bias) and precision (R2) of WOW data. Whole herd mean ± 1SD and individual daily mean ± 1SD identified 1,204 and 1,516 spurious data, with mean bias of -12.46 and -15.37 KG and R2 of 0.90 and 0.68, respectively.

Omadacycline (OMC) is a novel oral and intravenously administered aminomethylcycline with potent in-vitro activity against MDR gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. Post-marketing data investigating its potential place in the antibiotic armamentarium is limited. This study aimed at describing the clinical success and tolerability of patients receiving OMC for various infections. Methods: This was a multicenter, retrospective, observational study conducted from January 2020 to March 30, 2022. We included all patients ≥ 18 years of age that received OMC for any infection not related to Mycobacterium spp. for ≥72 hours. The primary outcome was clinical success at 30 days, defined as survival, the absence of persistence or re-emergence of infection during or after therapy, and the absence of escalation or alteration of OMC. Incidence of adverse effects while on OMC and reasons for OMC utilization were also analyzed. Results: This analysis included 19 patients from 10 distinct academic centers. The median age was 50 years (IQR, 37-63), 58% were male, 63% were Caucasian, and the median APACHE II, Charlson and SOFA scores were 10 (IQR 5-12.5), 4 (IQR 2-6.3), and 1 (IQR 0 – 2.25), respectively. Most patients had a bone and joint (8/19, 42.1%) or intra-abdominal infections (4/19, 21.1%), all with positive cultures. Eight patients (44.1%) had a polymicrobial infection and 4 (22.2%) had bacteremia. The most common pathogens encountered were Carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (5/19, 27.8%), E. coli (5/19, 27.8%), Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. (4/19, 22.2%), and K. pneumoniae (3/19, 16.7%). Clinical success was observed in 14 patients (74%) and 7 (36.8%) received combination therapy. Adverse drug reactions were reported in 3 patients (15.8%) and of those patients, none discontinued therapy. Reasons for prescribing OMC were mostly attributed to oral availability (12/14, 85.7%) and resistance to other agents (7/14, 50%). Conclusion: OMC demonstrated clinical effectiveness and safety against a large number of MDR pathogens. More robust, prospective, comparative studies are needed to confirm our preliminary findings.

Identification of antibiotic resistance can be achieved either phenotypically using Clinical & Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) cut-offs, or genotypically using whole genome sequencing (WGS). Here we compare the output from two software pipelines: EPISEQ CSTM (BIOMÉRIEUX, Marcy l ‘Etoile, France) and ResFinder to understand the similarities and differences in their ability to identify antibiotic resistance genes. Methods: We performed WGS on 89 clinical isolates of Enterococci (both E. faecalis and faecium) from two distinct tertiary care Detroit hospitals admitted to 16 intensive care units (ICU) and non-ICU wards between 2017-2019. WGS was performed using the NextSeq (Illumina Inc., CA) and analyzed using two bioinformatics pipelines mentioned above. The antibiotic resistance outputs were compared to identify both similarities and differences. Results: There was a significant difference in the genetic mutation output from both software. EPISEQ was able to identify 13 & 15 different genetic mutations for Enterococcus faecalis and faecium respectively which were not identified by ResFinder (Table 1). There were 9 & 12 common genetic mutations for Enterococcus faecalis and faecium respectively which were identified by both software. ResFinder was able to identify only two different gene mutations which were not identified by EPISEQ. Table 1:Genetic mutations identified by EPISEQ and ResFinder arranged by resistance to its respective drug class. Conclusion: The ability to identify different genetic mutations by both software products likely depends on databases used to determine the antibiotic resistant genes. EPISEQ CS uses 4 different databases (including ResFinder) as well as other proprietary databases making it more sensitive, thereby able to identify more genetic mutations compared to ResFinder alone. The costs for analyzing the WGS data through proprietary software is steep compared to open-source software. Standards metrics and methods for interpretations are needed before these methods can be adapted for clinical applications. Further studies are needed to understand the value of identifying these additional genes by comparing it to phenotypic susceptibilities.

Aims: Utilizing both Patients/Method: Preclinical studies included in vitro analysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in fatigued dermal fibroblasts, inhibition of ultraviolet radiation A (UVA) induced advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in keratinocytes, and ex vivo gene expression after incubation with the SSE. An institutional review board (IRB)‐approved short‐term, 7‐day, clinical case study was conducted on 28 female subjects, Fitzpatrick skin type I–IV, aged 30–60 years with moderate overall photodamage and skin fatigue. This was a double‐blinded, randomized, controlled, single‐center case study testing the AADS alone and in combination with an anti‐aging facial moisturizer (AAFM). Results: The SSE boosted intracellular ATP production in fatigued fibroblasts and reduced the formation of AGEs in keratinocytes. The SSE increased expression of genes related to epidermal keratinization and downregulated genes related to inflammation. Statistically significant improvement was found after 7 days of twice‐daily use of the AADS alone and in combination with the AAFM. Products were well tolerated and perceived by subjects.

As a result, they become more likely to engage in stakeholder management in the form of green management practices. Specifically, we explore the Green Power Partnership (GPP) which solicits firms to purchase green power. Using the data for the green power consumed by firms that are participating in the GPP program in the United States, we find that firms with performance above social aspiration are likely to increase their use of green power.

Pulsed Xenon Ultraviolet light (PX-UV), in combination with terminal cleaning, has been shown to improve disinfection and has the potential to lower HAIs by reducing the horizontal spread of infections in hospitals. Here, we assess the effect of PX-UV on the clonal recovery pattern of several E. coli sequence types (STs) using Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). Methods: A prospective, sham-controlled, double-blinded, interventional, crossover trial was conducted to compare standard terminal cleaning with PX-UV (intervention, Group Q) and standard terminal cleaning with sham UV (control, Group W) in 2 Detroit hospitals from 2017 to 2020. Treatments lasted 12 months before crossover, with a 6-month washout period in between (Group R) during which UV was not used. A total of 67 E. coli samples were collected. WGS of the isolates was performed using the Nextseq 550 (Illumina). After de novo assembly, BioNumerics calculation engine (v7.6) was used to complete Whole Genome Multilocus Sequence Type (wgMLST) analysis, assembly free and assembly-based call, and construction of minimum spanning tree (MST). Results: The total number of different STs found for the intervention UV device group (Q) and the sham UV device group (W) was 6 while the washout group (R) was 5. Out of the 9 total STs obtained, the most common was ST131 (Table 1). In Group Q, 11 of ST131 were found; 15 were found in Group W. During the washout period (R) 17 of ST131 were found. All other STs had 3 or less circulating clusters. After UV treatment ST1193, ST399, and ST7394 were not recovered. Fig. 1:Minimum spanning tree (MST) for E. coliTable 1:Total number of each sequence type (ST) per treatment group Conclusion: During UV intervention 3 different STs (ST1193, ST399, ST7394) were not recovered, but there were negligible changes to the frequency of recovery of the other 6 STs as compared to sham UV treatment. ST131 was the dominant E. coli ST found in Detroit, which is consistent with previously published data stating ST131 as the predominant strain. While PX-UV has previously demonstrated effectiveness on decreasing bioburden, our data does not indicate any remarkable change in clonality and prevalence of E. coli STs after PX-UV use.

This study aims to assess the effect of the addition of PX-UV to terminal cleaning on the clonal recovery of E. faecium sequence types (STs) using Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) on patient isolates. Methods: During 2017 to 2020 a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled, interventional, crossover trial in 2 separate Detroit hospitals (H1 and H2) compared HAI counts after the addition of either PX-UV or a non-UV sham device to terminal cleaning methods. The trial consisted of a total of 16 units randomized to have either the treatment of PX-UV (Group Q) or the sham control device with no UV (Group W) for 12 months. A washout period (Group R) of 6 months followed and the trial concluded with a 12-month crossover of treatments. A total of 60 E. faecium samples were collected, then WGS was performed by the Illumina Nextseq 550 instrument. de novo assembly was preformed using the SPAdes program. Whole Genome Multilocus Sequence Type (wgMLST) analysis was performed by BioNumerics (v7.6) to construct minimum spanning tree (MST). Results: A total of 7 STs were obtained across the 2 hospitals (H1 and H2). ST117, ST17, and ST80 all had more than 10 total recovered isolates, ST117 being the most frequent with 24 isolates. Less than 3 isolates were recovered for all other STs. For all STs, Group Q (PX-UV) had 14, Group R (washout period) had 22, and Group W (non-UV sham) had 24. ST18 was only found in Group Q. ST412, ST584, and ST736 were not found in Group W. The data shows that the intervention PX-UV group had a reduction of clonal recovery by 10 STs as compared to the sham UV group. Table 1:Total number of each sequence type (ST) in H1 and H2 Conclusion: The overall reductions in the number of isolates in the real UV units was driven by reductions in the ST117 a predominant strain in a hospital environment reported previously in Detroit and ST80. There were negligible differences in recovery of other ST between the groups. The reduction in clonal recovery of E. faecium isolates in Group Q as compared to Group R might be related to use of PX-UV following terminal room cleaning.

Most of the drop-wall interactions studies are based on the impact of a single drop on the wall. To accurately mimic and model the real engine conditions, it is necessary to characterize spray/wall interactions with different impingement frequencies at a wide range of wall temperatures. In this study, a numerical method, based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), is used to simulate consecutive droplet impacts on a heated wall both below and above the Leidenfrost temperature. Impact regimes are identified for various impact conditions by analyzing the time evolution of the post-impingement process of n-heptane drops at different impingement frequencies and wall surface temperatures. For wall temperature below the Leidenfrost temperature, the recoiled film does not leave the surface. Recoiling of the film takes place at a rapid rate at wall temperature above the boiling point of the liquid. For the given impingement conditions, at low impingement frequency, the succeeding drops meet the secondary drop, coalescing into a large drop. An increase in the impingement frequency promotes splashing. For the same impinging conditions, with the wall temperature above the Leidenfrost temperature, at low impingement frequency, recoiling and rebounding of the secondary droplets is seen along with the secondary droplets above the heated wall. On the other hand, at higher impingement frequencies, the succeeding drops impinge on thin liquid films about to be raised above the wall by the vapor film on the wall and splash forming isolated chunks of secondary droplets. Results of this study can further lead to the development of spray/wall impingement models that consider the impact frequency and wall temperature at realistic engine conditions.</div></div>","https://www.sae.org/gsdownload/?prodCd=2022-01-0508",""

Different evolutionary rates, inheritance mechanisms, and selection pressures set the stage for incompatibilities between interacting products of the two genomes. The mitonuclear coevolution hypothesis posits that incompatibilities may be avoided if evolution in one genome selects for complementary changes in interacting genes encoded by the other genome. Nuclear compensation, in which deleterious mtDNA changes are offset by compensatory nuclear changes, is often invoked as the primary mechanism for mitonuclear coevolution. Yet, direct evidence supporting nuclear compensation is rare. Here, we used data from 58 mammalian species representing eight orders to show strong correlations between evolutionary rates of mt and nuclear-encoded mt-targeted (N-mt) proteins, but not between mt and non-mt-targeted nuclear proteins, providing strong support for mitonuclear coevolution across mammals. N-mt genes with direct mt interactions also showed the strongest correlations. Although most N-mt genes had elevated dN/dS ratios compared to mt genes (as predicted under nuclear compensation), N-mt sites in close contact with mt proteins were not overrepresented for signs of positive selection compared to noncontact N-mt sites (contrary to predictions of nuclear compensation). Furthermore, temporal patterns of N-mt and mt amino acid substitutions did not support predictions of nuclear compensation, even in positively selected, functionally important residues with direct mitonuclear contacts. Overall, our results strongly support mitonuclear coevolution across ∼170 million years of mammalian evolution but fail to support nuclear compensation as the major mode of mitonuclear coevolution.","https://academic.oup.com/mbe/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/molbev/msac233/46649929/msac233.pdf",""

Next, we demonstrate how the loss of this enhancer, but not trans-activating factors, drove the loss of sodium channel gene expression from muscle in South American electric fish. While this enhancer is also altered in African electric fish, key transcription factor binding sites and enhancer activity are retained, suggesting that the convergent loss of sodium channel expression from muscle in these two electric fish lineages occurred via different processes.","https://www.science.org/doi/pdf/10.1126/sciadv.abm2970",""

Results: A total of 20 sequence types (STs) were found throughout the trial, the most common being ST5 and ST8 with roughly 20 to 50 each found in all 3 treatment groups (Table 1. The other 18 STs were only found 7 times or less in each treatment group. ). During intervention (Q) 9 STs were found, however 11 were not recovered after PX-UV (ST1, ST1508, ST22, ST231, ST3287, ST3462, ST398, ST59, ST6790, ST840, ST97). During the sham treatment (W) 15 STs were found while 7 were found during the washout period (R). The minimum spanning tree (MST) shows clusters of related ST groups color coded by treatment type (Figure 1). Fig. 1:Minimum spanning tree (MST) for S. aureusTable 1:Total number of each sequence type (ST) per treatment group Conclusion: The difference between the STs recovered during intervention and during sham UV treatment was inconsequential because many factors influence the amount of STs recovered (treatment, number of patients, sampling bias, and terminal cleaning methods). There was no clonality noted among any of the intervention group (Fig. 1). Both dominant strains (ST5, ST8) have been characterized as hypervirulent and predominant previously, consistent with our data. Our data does not demonstrate any notable change in the clonal prevalence of S. aureus after PX-UV use.

Methods: We identified infants with T21 from the Texas Birth Defects Registry, and maternal smoking and infant vital status were obtained from linked birth and death certificate data, respectively. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios between maternal smoking and death between 0 to ≤ 364 days, 28‐364 days, and 0‐27 days. Results: We found a significant association between maternal smoking and death between 0 to ≤ 364 (unadjusted HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.07, 2.77), which was no longer statistically significant after adjustment for covariates (adjusted HR 1.55, 95% CI 0.94, 2.56).

Hence, identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associated with phenotype could increase the amount of information used in the genetic evaluation of the trait. Using RNA-sequence data from lactating Holstein cows, a set of SNP (n = 69) were discovered among embryo mortality conceptuses (Conceptus-SNP) associated with maternal recognition of pregnancy on day 16 after artificial insemination (AI). To further study these SNP, our objective was to conduct analyses to identify markers associated with HPG in Red Angus. Phenotypic records and genotypes were provided by the Red Angus Association of America (RAAA). For phenotypes, a total of 59,387 cattle records, from the June 2022 RAAA genetic evaluation, were used in the analysis. For genotype data, a 47,860 SNP panel (excluding SNP on the X-chromosome) were formed by combining the historical RAAA genotype data (96,162 animals with genotypes) and genotypes from whole genome sequence of 30 prominent Red Angus AI sires. Markers were mapped to the ARS-UCD1.2 bovine reference genome and then imputed to 47,860 SNP panel using findhap software. A subset of SNP (n = 2,169 SNP; Conceptus-SNP and the multi-breed selected reduced panel [MSRP]) were extracted from the imputed genotypes file. Using PLINK software, genotype quality control procedure was performed so that animals with call rate &lt; 0.9 were removed. A marker was removed if: it had minor allele frequency &lt; 0.01, not in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (P &lt; 0.00001), or in high linkage disequilibrium (r2 &gt; 0.95). The final genotype file contained 96,667 animals with 2,137 SNP. A Bayes Cπ single-step super hybrid model (π = 0.99), using the BOLT software package, was used to estimate marker’s posterior probability of inclusion (PPI), the marker significance criterion in predicting HPG. A marker’s PPI was calculated as the average probability from four different Gibbs sampling chains of 75,000 iterations that included 5,000 iterations as burn-in. Markers rs42576394 (18:60583784) and rs42942055 (14:34249373) had PPI of 25.5 and 7.1%, respectively; suggesting association with HPG. None of the Conceptus-SNP had a detectable association with HPG; however, these Conceptus-SNP may be much more informative for genotype to phenotype association analyses for the trait of stayability. Such a trait would be measured with lactating mature beef cows and potentially more similar to the lactating Holstein cows from which the markers were discovered.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/100/Supplement_4/35/46604847/skac313.050.pdf",""

Future managed streamflow scenarios (through year 2099) were selected from among 97 scenarios developed based on downscaled, bias‐corrected global climate model outputs to evaluate future inflows to the principal surface water storage reservoirs, possible future reservoir releases, and groundwater pumping to sustain irrigated agriculture. The streamflow projections describe a wide range of dry and wet conditions compared to the average historical flows in the river, indicating significant uncertainty in future water availability in the Rio Grande Basin. We applied the Soil and Water Assessment Tool to illustrate the impact of climate futures on different components of the water budget at a watershed scale. Results indicate declining reliability of reservoir storage to meet the water demand of irrigated agriculture. The impact of declining surface water can be offset by increasing the pressure on the already‐strained groundwater resources.

To investigate the hypothesis that the process of cell-cell fusion alone leaves durable effects in daughter cell populations derived from homotypic cell-cell fusion, GFP and mCherry labeled cells from the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line HCC1806 were co-cultured and subclones were generated through single-cell FACS isolation of spontaneously generated fusion progeny (double positive cells; n=9) and control cells (single positive cells; n=9) from the same population. Subclonal populations were expanded for &gt;19 generations (1 to ~106 cells) before experimental measurements and perturbations. The morphological features, growth rate, chemotactic ability, motility, karyotype, gene expression profile, and chemotherapeutic response of each fusion and control subclone were characterized. We find no durable differences between fusion and control subclones in terms of growth rate, chemotactic ability, and response to 5-fluorouracil. However, subclonal populations generated from homotypic cell-cell fusion show remarkably consistent and statistically significant increased sensitivity to paclitaxel and doxorubicin compared to control subclones. Further, differential expression analysis of RNA sequencing data revealed loss of expression of cancer-testis antigen (CTA) MAGEC2 in fusion cells compared to controls. The MAGE family of CTAs have shown promise as an immunotherapeutic target, but this study suggests that loss or downregulation of MAGEC2 after homotypic cell-cell fusion could allow immune escape. While fusion progeny may be more protected from immune threats, fusion progeny are simultaneously sensitized to paclitaxel and doxorubicin which highlights the potential need for standard chemotherapeutics after CTA immunotherapy. Where current literature posits cell-cell fusion as a pathologically disruptive event which may increase therapeutic resistance, this is the first study to show that fusion progeny are counterintuitively more sensitive to standard chemotherapeutics and to indicate homotypic cell-cell fusion as a potential mechanism of immunotherapeutic escape.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/82/10_Supplement/PR007/696356/Abstract-PR007-Homotypic-cell-cell-fusion-in-TNBC",""

These disorders are grouped under the term fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Adequate nutrition and a conducive intrauterine environment are essential for healthy fetal development. Nutrient deficiencies resulting from inadequate maternal nutrient ingestion may be compounded by alcohol-induced altered nutrient metabolism, placental clearance, and malabsorption. Alcohol-induced alteration of the intrauterine environment is the main source of developmental deficits and nutritional insufficiencies can worsen the effects on fetal development. In this review, we discuss studies examining the collective and interactive effects of nutrition (specifically iron, selenium, vitamin A, thiamine, zinc, folate, vitamin B12, choline, and amino acids) relative to gestational alcohol consumption and its effects on fetal growth and development. We also summarize scientific reports that tested potential benefits of micronutrient supplementation in animal models of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and in humans. In summary, the deleterious effects of alcohol exposure in relation to nutrient homeostasis further validate that avoidance of alcohol consumption during pregnancy is the most effective way to mitigate the teratogenic effects of alcohol.","https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article-pdf/80/6/1568/43622858/nuab119.pdf",""

Moreover, the usage of electrical stimulation can affect postmortem metabolism and meat quality. However, few studies have looked at the combined impact of chilling and electrical stimulation on temperature decline, postmortem biochemistry, and color among the current consist of US beef. Beef carcasses (N =162, &lt; 30 months) were randomly selected from two beef processing plants. One side of each carcass was electrically stimulated (ES), while the opposing side was not electrically stimulated (NES). Matched sides were subjected to either conventional spray chilling (CONV) or delayed-spray chilling (DELAY). Deep tissue (10.5-cm under the pelvic bone) and surface temperature (1.5-cm under the loin fat) were continuously monitored during chilling in addition to temperature and pH measurements from the semimembranosus (SM), longissimus lumborum (LL), and psoas major (PM) muscles at an initial time (45 to 60 min), 6 h, 12 h, and after chilling (28 to 36 h) postmortem. Further, the instrumental (L*, a*, and b*) and visual color of the PM were evaluated. For data analysis, carcasses with hot carcass weights above or below the average were considered heavy or light, respectively. A nonlinear regression model was fitted to the continuous deep and surface temperatures, whereas other parameters were evaluated using a mixed model. Electrical stimulation improved (P &lt; 0.05) the color of PM in light weight carcasses, but not (P &gt; 0.05) in heavy weight carcasses. Temperature decline was faster (P &lt; 0.05), and pH decline slower (P &lt; 0.05) in the SM and LL of light weight carcasses under CONV. Exponential decay models for deep and surface temperatures indicated the rate of cooling differed (P &lt; 0.05) due to the combination of treatment factors. Heavy weight carcasses in DELAY had slower rates of temperature decline (P &lt; 0.05). Overall, the variability in carcass size affected temperature decline and postmortem metabolism.

Emerging evidence has shown that taste perception is altered during the development of obesity. Moreover, suppression of taste receptor or taste signaling molecules potentiate the inflammatory response, and the progression of inflammation attenuates the expression of taste receptors in vivo. Together, these findings suggest a possible interplay between taste signaling and inflammation. This review summarizes the interactions between type 1 (T1Rs) and type 2 taste receptors (T2Rs) and inflammation, as well as the impact of obesity on T1R- and T2R-mediated signaling. Furthermore, we evaluate the possible role that taste receptors play in regulating the inflammatory response during obesity as a therapeutic target to prevent the progression of comorbidities associated with obesity.","https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article-pdf/80/8/1919/44569169/nuac007.pdf",""

These measurements enable profiling of potential and dopant distributions across GaN pn junctions produced by uninterrupted epitaxial growth and by regrowth on an etched surface. Clear differences are observed in comparisons to the electronic structure of these two types of junctions that can be correlated with results of complementary characterization of dopant distributions reported for similarly grown structures.

For over half a century, PW treatment and handling have evolved from a waste product to a reusable stream for the petroleum industry. PW is reused and recycled for hydrocarbon recovery processes, well completion, stimulation, drilling, etc. Despite this usage, enormous volumes are still required to be disposed of in the subsurface aquifers or surface water bodies after treatment. Challenges to PW treatment are related mainly to widely varying PW characteristics, nonuniformity of water treatment systems for different fields, and difficulty in designing novel technology due to changing production rates and other design parameters. This paper focuses on purpose-specific water treatment units used in various activities within the oil and gas industries and technological advancement. A detailed account of the historical development of current water treatment practices, disposal, available technology, and challenges in implementation are presented. Forward-looking recommendations are given on how emerging technologies can be integrated into everyday oil and gas activities to achieve the purpose-specific treatment goal.","https://onepetro.org/PO/article-pdf/38/01/51/3066819/spe-212275-pa.pdf",""

It is commonly assumed that an entrepreneur can always “go back to work,” however, it is unclear how recruiters evaluate entrepreneurial experience early in the selection process. Drawing from screening theory, attribution theory, and the person-organization fit perspective, we designed three studies to begin answering questions about the challenges former entrepreneurs may face when attempting to find more traditional employment. Study 1 revealed that recruiters evaluate former entrepreneurs more negatively than job applicants with more traditional work experience, and this relationship is stronger when former entrepreneurs close—versus sell—their venture. Study 2 employed a qualitative, inductive approach to examine why recruiters may be biased against former entrepreneurs and found that there are often assumptions of rapid turnover, insubordinate behavior, and organizational misfit. Finally, the Study 3 results suggested that the negative evaluation of former entrepreneurs may not be universal and depends on important contextual factors such as job characteristics, length of entrepreneurial experience, and details about entrepreneurial exit.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/01492063221117119",""

America’s war in Afghanistan was lost for many reasons, but the U.S. military contributed to its downfall in two ways. First, U.S. combat units, trained to fight conventional battles, conducted counterterrorism operations (aka “search and destroy” missions) against guerilla forces that resulted in hardening the resolve of the enemy while causing widespread and senseless civilian casualties. Second, the Afghan military could not exist without U.S. logistical and material support. Because the Afghan Army was trained and equipped to fight a conventional-type war, they were incapable of operating independent of U.S. support, and could not survive on their own against guerrilla forces in a protracted civil war. Therefore, the Afghan security forces were not properly trained and equipped, demonstrating that the U.S. military repeated mistakes of the Vietnam War. It is argued that the United States must temper its conventional warfare mindset and re-direct resources toward improved ways to conduct limited wars against irregular adversaries. The constabulary forces concept described by Morris Janowitz is a feasible way to improve the chances that U.S. forces will succeed in such limited wars.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0095327X221100584",""

MFs and macrophages interact in colonic tissue. However, the mechanisms of MF mediated regulation of macrophages under intestinal mucosal tolerance has emerging evidence. We hypothesized that MF-restricted MyD88 signaling regulates macrophage maturation under colonic mucosal tolerance. Methods: RNAseq, qRT-PCR, H&E, and flow cytometry was used for analysis of colonic tissue/cell derived from B6ACTA2CreMyD88fl/fl, B6Col1a2CreMyD88fl/fl and B6RagCol1a2CreMyD88fl/fl MF-specific conditional KO mice. Results: MF-specific deletion of MyD88 in vivo resulted in the development of microcolitis and was associated with dysbiotic decrease in Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes bacterial ratio, a hallmark of intestinal inflammation. This process was associated with the increase in colonic expression of genes linked to the inflammatory activity of myeloid cells and accumulation of immature monocyte-derived macrophages. In vitro deletion of MyD88 from MFs (isolated from MF-specific MyD88 conditional KO mice) resulted in changes of basal and TLR4 mediated pathways involved in myeloid cell migration/maturation and inflammation. Using MF-macrophage co-cultures we demonstrated the MF-restricted MyD88 signaling suppresses myeloid cell inflammatory activity. Conclusion: Intrinsic MyD88 signaling within colonic mesenchymal cells is critical to control myeloid cell differentiation and inflammatory activity under mucosal tolerance in the gut.","https://journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article/208/1_Supplement/113.14/236448/MyD88-mediated-signaling-in-myo-fibroblasts-is",""

The current study examined the relationship between adolescents' psychosocial maturity, perceived importance of the CDC guidelines and adherence to the CDC guidelines within some of the highest risk groups for contracting COVID‐19 in a county particularly impacted by the pandemic (i.e., Hispanic and low‐SES youth in El Paso, Texas). Methods: Participants completed a phone interview with a research assistant regarding their thoughts and behaviours in the initial months of the COVID‐19 pandemic. Adolescents ( Results: Results indicated that although more psychosocially mature adolescents reported greater adherence to the CDC guidelines than less psychosocially mature adolescents, the association between psychosocial maturity and adherence was fully mediated by how important adolescents felt it was to follow the guidelines. Specifically, greater perceived importance was associated with greater adherence to the guidelines. Conclusions: The current study found that more psychosocially mature adolescents adhere to CDC's safety guidelines better than less psychosocially mature adolescents because they are more likely to view the guidelines as important.

The Mulliken symmetries of Ag and En≠0 are assigned to the wave functions. The positive and negative phase regions (deflections of the ring harmonics) are used to determine whether a wave function is even (g) or odd (u) under inversion. The transition moment integrals for absorption, emission, Rayleigh scattering, and Raman scattering are analyzed using the direct product table for the D∞h point group. This yields the symmetry selection rules for the 1DPR system, which are Δn = { ± 1} for direct absorption and emission, and Δn = {0, ± 2} for Rayleigh and Raman scattering. These selection rules match the results we computed in the analytical calculus solution chapters. The results are also in agreement with the conservation of angular momenta for 1- and 2-photon processes.","https://pubs.aip.org/books/monograph/chapter-pdf/12252781/9780735425668_009.pdf",""

Method:: Parent–child language use in 119 Spanish-speaking, Mexican immigrant mothers and their children at two ages ( Results:: Child productive language significantly increased over the year, whereas mothers showed commensurate increases in vocabulary diversity but very little change in grammatical complexity. Mother–child discourse was characterized by discontinuity: Mothers decreased their turn length and asked fewer questions while children increased on both measures. Rates of responding to questions remained high for both mothers and children even as children increased and mothers decreased over time. Mothers and children showed significant rank-order stability in productive language and measures of discourse. Mothers' rate of asking questions and children's responses to questions during the first interaction predicted children's receptive vocabulary a year later. Conclusions:: As children become more sophisticated communicators, language input remains important, with discourse features growing in relevance. Children's early opportunities to respond to parents' questions in the context of play benefit their language skills.

The line spectra are obvious phenomena from the selection rules and stick spectra.

About 50,000 infections are reported per year due to vancomycin-resistant Enterococci. Understanding the genotypic mutations can help recognize the potential burden for antibiotic resistance that exists in a population. In this study, using whole genome sequencing (WGS) we aim to analyze the prevalence of genetic resistance markers for commonly used antibiotics for Enterococcal treatment. Methods: Whole genome sequencing was performed using the NextSeq (Illumina Inc., CA) on 60 isolates of E. faecium and 29 isolates of E. faecalis. The isolates were obtained from two different Detroit area hospitals from 2017-2019. The data from WGS was analyzed using EPISEQ CSTM (BIOMÉRIEUX, Marcy l ‘Etoile, France) bioinformatic database to obtain specific resistance genes which would correspond to commonly used antibiotics for treatment of Enterococcal infections. Results: Among the 89 Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis investigated, we identified a total of 33 unique resistance genes across 18 classes of antibiotics (Table 1). We detected genetic mutations efmA, pbp5, tet(L), liar, liaS unique to E. faecium and only emeA unique to E. faecalis. E. faecium and E. faecalis share 14 similar resistance genes. E. faecium and E. faecalis had 12 and 7 unique resistance genes, respectively but are of same drug classes. The most common antibiotic classes include aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, quinolones, beta-lactams, glycopeptides, macrolides, and pyrimidine analogs. Table 1:Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis genetic mutations and drug class resistance Conclusion: Enterococcus faecium had a greater number of resistance genes with glycopeptide, aminoglycoside, and beta lactam resistance when compared to Enterococcus faecalis. Whereas Enterococcus faecalis had more resistance genes associated with macrolides, tetracyclines, pyrimidine analogs, and Bactrim. In general, both appear to have many genes that encode for resistance to major classes of antibiotics which are used for treatment of Enterococcal infections. Further comparison with phenotypic susceptibility testing data would help better understand the practical implications of our resistance gene testing.

Using the four substantive domains in Appova and Arbaugh’s (2018) framework on teachers' motivation to learn in PD—teacher education and PD, educational psychology, andragogy and adult learning, and policy and accountability—we argue that teacher motivation, rather than mere PD structure or content, is the true linchpin of teacher learning.

In light of ongoing racial tensions in America, the purpose of the current research was to examine whether the ISE replicates among racial groups. Study 1 replicated the ISE among African American, European American, and Latinx American university students and, unexpectedly, found that European American participants responded more positively to praise delivered by a racial outgroup member. Study 2 replicated these results in a nonstudent sample and identified motivation to respond without prejudice as a moderator of the praise effect.

We extend this literature by considering how pipelines may emerge not just out of strategic intent but also out of informal social processes reflecting network transitivity and homophily. Using bipartite social network analysis techniques in a sample of 110 public U.S. electronics component manufacturers, we argue and find evidence for transitive effects between firms’ employee-based ties to elite educational institutions and the formation of interfirm employee pipelines. We demonstrate that pipelines are more likely to form between firms that both hire educational elites, especially when those firms share ties to the same elite schools and when those shared elite schools are executives’ alma mater(s). We also find that these effects tend to be more pronounced when the focal firm has higher growth potential, encouraging mobility by attracting potential elite candidates and facilitating the two-way matching process in labor markets. Our theory and findings contribute to a better understanding of informal processes underlying pipeline formation and specifically demonstrate how hiring tendencies may lead to closed recruiting networks characterized by elite replication.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/01492063221097896",""

Because of the cumulative impact of immigration‐related stress, there is a need for research aimed at identifying specific contextual stressors that have the greatest impact on Latina/o immigrant parenting. Further, given significant barriers to access mental health services, there is an urgency to comprehend how pre‐existing family strengths might counteract these parenting shortcomings in Latina/o families. Accordingly, we examined in these investigation‐specific pathways through which immigration‐related stress affects maternal parenting practices, and how emotional and relational processes within families might act as predecessors to positive parenting practices within a context of adversity. This study is embedded within a larger program of research aimed at culturally adapting evidence‐based parenting programs for low‐income Latina/o immigrants. Our sample consisted of 71 Mexican‐origin Latina/o mothers, residents of an urban setting in the Midwest. According to Bayesian estimated path analysis, immigration‐related stress was associated with parenting stress and emotional support, while emotional support, parenting stress, and the co‐parenting alliance were associated with positive parenting practices. Indirect effects demonstrate that immigration‐related stress is negatively associated with positive parenting practices when mediated by parenting stress and emotional support. Current findings highlight the need to carefully examine the impact of immigration‐related stress on the parenting practices of Latina/o immigrant families and the need to inform parent training interventions accordingly.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/famp.12797",""

Simulation models can provide valuable insight into this complexity to guide future research and management decisions for sustainable grazing systems. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the combinations of grazing management (continuous vs. rotational), stocking rate (low, moderate, or high), and burning (none vs. annual spring burn) on soil erosion, nutrient losses, and carbon sequestration. Soil, weather, and forage species data were collected for 3 locations in the Central Great Plains (Konza Prairie Biological Station, Kansas; Agricultural Research Center-Hays, Kansas; Central Plains Experimental Range, Wyoming). These data were used to simulate combinations of rangeland management scenarios using the Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender (APEX) model. A stocker cattle operation was simulated at Hays, Kansas and Wyoming locations, and a cow-calf operation at Konza, Kansas location. Burning increased soil loss from water erosion regardless of stocking rate or grazing management. Rotational grazing increased soil loss at the Kansas locations, but decreased soil loss at Wyoming compared with continuous grazing. Stocking rate had little effect on nitrogen losses, but rotational grazing decreased nitrogen loss compared with continuous grazing. Greater stocking rates slightly decreased phosphorus losses with continuous grazing, but not rotational grazing. Burning decreased phosphorus losses with continuous grazing at Konza, but not the other locations. Greater stocking rates decreased the deposition of soil organic carbon especially with continuous grazing, and burning resulted in losses of soil organic carbon at Konza and Wyoming. In conclusion, rangeland management practices differentially affect nutrient processes among ecosystems such that a one-size-fits-all management scheme will not maximize retention of all nutrients in all ecosystems.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/100/Supplement_3/87/45962660/skac247.170.pdf",""

The complex relationships among floodplain vegetation, topography and hydrology affect water availability. This paper investigated whether hydrological assumptions within meteorological drought indicators and ecophysiological assumptions within remote‐sensing drought indicators reflect drought deficits as they occur in floodplain forests. We compared the performance of widely used meteorological and remote‐sensing drought indicators in floodplain forests to tree‐ring validation using five species at three floodplains in eastern Texas, USA. We found that the water balance in the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index and the water loss estimated by the Evaporative Stress Index were useful models of water deficits in floodplain forests at the site and sub‐site scales, respectively. Hydrological and stand conditions varied among sites enough to affect the specific patterns of tree‐species responded to drought. However, of the species we examined, tree rings in green ash were the most consistently affected by drought across floodplains and were the most closely correlated with both meteorological and remotely sensed drought indicators. Finally, drought effects varied by species and among and within floodplains, but generally, growth of trees in topographically drier sites was more closely correlated with drought indicators.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/eco.2421",""

The detection is based on the light absorption when it propagates through a medium. Most inorganic and organic molecules have characteristic absorption lines in the mid-infrared (mid-IR), which correspond to fundamental vibrational modes and in the near-IR (first overtones) presenting their absorption fingerprints. Here, we summarize the recent developments of the three techniques, namely, wavelength modulation spectroscopy (WMS), cavity ringdown spectroscopy (CRDS), and frequency comb spectroscopy (FCS), and describe their main features as well as possible applications, illustrated by recent experimental results. Emphasis is made on methane detection as applied to breath analysis and atmospheric monitoring. For the WMS technique, we consider local measurements with a multipass cell and also kilometer long open-path configurations for the near-IR and mid-IR spectral regions. The results of measurements of methane in exhaled breath with the CRDS technique in the near-IR are presented for a group of subjects of different ages. We consider various schemes of the FCS that enable fast broadband detection, including direct spectroscopy, dual FCS, and Vernier FCS, and review numerous applications of this approach that revolutionized the field of absorption spectroscopy. The current trends and possible future developments and applications are also discussed.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/5.0091263/20035278/220901_1_5.0091263.pdf",""

Sea storms threatened vessels and their crew members, who were near defenceless in the face of such violent natural elements. First, merchants sought to name their vessels for traits that bespoke speed. A vessel that remained for long stretches of time in any port lost capital by the day. Consequently, ships stayed for short periods of time in Atlantic harbours whenever possible. Second, force was also central to merchants’ naming patterns. Through christening their vessels after absolute monarchs, saints, classical deities and heroes, merchants sought appellations that represented a symbolic, or in many instances, real protection against the elements at sea.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/08438714221079551",""

Contrary to general assumptions, these students were able to astutely contribute to classroom lessons, discussions, and interviews about Nat Turner, an enslaved Black American, who led a rebellion in 1831. Employing notions of Black intellectual thought and curricular and pedagogical resuscitation as theoretical frameworks, in addition to critical hermeneutic phenomenology as its methodology, this study highlights the voices of young Black boys often missing in early childhood discourse. Findings indicate that the students expressed a favorable assessment of Nat Turner and his comrades. The statement, “But there is a God,” ultimately confronts the unavailability and restricted options for Black humanity in a racist society, but also an awareness testifying to a self-ordained defense of the Black body.

Our difference-in-differences test reveals an increase in GC opinions following the ruling for near-insolvent Delaware firms. Further tests indicate an increase in type I audit opinion errors and no change in audit risk after the ruling. Additional analysis shows that, after the ruling, near-insolvent Delaware firms are less likely to dismiss their auditors following the receipt of a GC report. Overall, our findings are consistent with managers and directors with increased fiduciary duties toward creditors exerting less pressure on auditors and allowing them to reveal more GC opinions.

Results from the complete sample, N=447, explained 36% of the variance in the outcome. Significant individual predictors included in the final model were crime type, religiosity, and forgiveness of self and situations. We split the sample on crime type and found that for the violent offenders (N=228), 39% of the variance in the outcome was explained; in addition to religiosity, all three assessments of forgiveness were significant predictors. For the non-violent offenders (N=209), 35% of the outcome’s variability was explained. Religiosity, forgiveness of self and situation were significant predictors for this sub-sample.

Unlike hospitals that did not participate in value-based care initiatives, ACOs were able to generate better quality outcomes while also improving overall efficiency. Furthermore, ACO providers that used health IT effectively demonstrated better patient health outcomes due to greater information integration with other providers. In other words, ACOs created value by not only reducing the cost of care but also improving patient outcomes simultaneously.

Considering the rapid fermentation of sugars, animals supplemented with pectin maintained higher pH (P = 0.021) due to changes in bacterial populations to digest the pectic substances (Table 1). Lactate production after starch digestion caused lower pH. Despite the differences in evaluated energy substrates, there was no effect on the primary SCFA concentration (P &gt; 0.05). Citrus pulp provided greater formic (P = 0.005) and valeric (P = 0.042) acids concentrations compared with corn, but there was no influence of formic acid in lactic acid production (Table 1). The greater IVGP by citrus pulp (P = 0.0140; Figure 1) may be related to its greater carbohydrate fraction A, soluble with a rapid rate of rumen degradation, and also because its ruminal fermentation results in greater acetic acid production, which provides more ruminal H2 and CO2, favoring the CH4 production. The citrus pulp can be used as an alternative source to corn because it might prevent acidosis, does not affect the main SCFA production, and is a non-human edible feed.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/100/Supplement_3/384/45962847/skac247.703.pdf",""

This 3-year investigation of adverse events related to contact lens wear in 7- to 11-year-old participants helps optometrists understand what to expect when fitting children with soft contact lenses. PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to report the frequency and type of ocular and nonocular adverse events related to soft contact lens wear in children. METHODS: Seven- to 11-year-old children wore soft contact lenses for 3 years. Adverse events were defined by a slit-lamp examination finding of grade 3 or worse; parental report of a clinically meaningful change (determined by the examiner) in eyes, vision, or health; or a clinically meaningful response (determined by examiner) to a symptom checklist. Adverse events were categorized and reported by examiners and finalized by the Executive Committee. The presence or absence of an infiltrate and a list of diagnoses was determined at the conclusion of the study. RESULTS: The 294 participants wore their contact lenses 73.0 ± 26.5 hours per week, and 220 (74.8%) encountered at least 1 adverse event. Of the 432 adverse events, 75.2% were ocular, and 24.8% were nonocular. Contact lens wear was probably or definitely related to 60.6% of the ocular and 2.8% of the nonocular adverse events. None of the ocular adverse events were serious or severe or caused permanent contact lens discontinuation. The corneal infiltrate incidence was 185 cases per 10,000 patient-years of wear (95% confidence interval, 110 to 294). The incidence of moderate ocular adverse events that were definitely or probably related to contact lens wear was 405 cases per 10,000 patient-years of wear (95% confidence interval, 286 to 557). CONCLUSIONS: The adverse events experienced by 7- to 11–year-old myopic children rarely required meaningful treatment and never led to permanent discontinuation of contact lens wear or loss of best-corrected vision.","https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/OPX.0000000000001902",""

Research Design and Methods: Data are drawn from 2 rounds of the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (2010/2011 and 2015/2016). The analytic sample includes 575 sexually active respondents aged 62–86 at baseline. Cognitive impairment is measured using a survey-adapted version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, with categories of normal, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia. We estimate cross-lagged models to test the potential reciprocal relationships between cognitive impairment and feelings of sexual obligation. Results: Older adults with dementia at baseline had significantly higher odds of sexual obligation 5 years later than their peers with normal cognition at baseline, after adjusting for gender, race/ethnicity, education, income, age, marital status, self-rated health, depression, comorbidities, and sexual obligation at baseline. We find no evidence of a reciprocal relationship, as sexual obligation at baseline did not predict later cognitive status. Discussion and Implications: Older adults with dementia often remain sexually active after their 60s, and many of them feel obligated to have sex with their partner. Our study highlights the importance of understanding the context of their sexual lives. The quality of their sexual relationship, such as whether they feel a duty to maintain their earlier sexual activity or please their partner, and the health implications of sexual obligation should be considered alongside the increase of older adults with dementia.","https://academic.oup.com/gerontologist/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/geront/gnac078/44884318/gnac078.pdf",""

The control information for each stratum is based on the subject’s exposure experience, and the stratifying variable is the individual subject. It is generally accepted that any effects associated with the matching covariates by stratum can be removed in the conditional logistic regression model. However, when there are numerous covariates, it is important to perform variable selection to study the functional association between the variables and the relative risk of diseases or clustered binary outcomes by simultaneously adjusting effect modifications. The methods for simultaneously evaluating effect modifications by matching covariates such as time, as well as performing automatic variable and functional selections under semiparametric model frameworks, are quite limited. In this article, we propose a unified Bayesian approach due to its ability to detect both parametric and nonparametric relationships between the predictors and the relative risk of diseases or binary outcomes, accounting for potential effect modifications by matching covariates such as time, and perform automatic variable and functional selections.

Nevertheless, due to the heterogeneous mechanical and metallurgical properties, repair welds are susceptible to re-cracking during subsequent operations. The API 1996 report has shown that 88% of outer-diameter (OD) repair welds have experienced re-cracking in coke drums. The re-cracking susceptibility downgrades the efficiency of welding repair to extend coke drum operation life and may increase the complexity of coke drum maintenance. Hence, addressing the low-cycle fatigue failure of weld becomes a critical issue to optimize welding repair for coke drum maintenance. Alloy 625 is a commonly used Ni-based filler metal to perform coke drum repairs due to its good thermal and metallurgical compatibility with the base metal. However, weld metal dilution close to the weld interface changes local microstructure and mechanical properties from the rest part of the weld. In this study, an external repair welds of 1.25Cr-0.5Mo steel under as-received (Normalized and Tempered) and service-aged conditions with Alloy 625 using HP-GTAW process are evaluated based on low-cycle fatigue tests and failure analysis. Weld transition samples are extracted to encompass the transition from weld metal to base metal at the gage section. Low-cycle fatigue tests are performed at 0.7%, 1.0%, 1.5% and 2.0% strain amplitudes. Interfacial cracks are observed at lower strain amplitudes (0.7% and 1.0%) and failures at higher strain amplitudes tend to occur at the base metal region. Metallurgical characterizations are performed to characterize the microstructure at weld interface and measure the mechanical properties through micro hardness. Interfacial cracks are examined using Scanning Electron Microscopy. This study helps clarify how microstructure and mechanical properties contribute to the interfacial cracking of the Ni-base alloy and steel dissimilar joint.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/PVP/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/PVP2022-84764/6939652/v002t03a001-pvp2022-84764.pdf",""

This heat exchanger design is unique in that it uses reduced metal oxide particle-to-sCO2 heat exchanger for cost-effective energy storage applications. The design uses low velocity, laminar air as the re-oxidizing reactant to transfer the heat of the re-oxidizing reaction to a sCO2 power loop. The design of the heat exchanger is based on a 2-D, 3-fluid plate/fin heat transfer model. The model parameterizes the size, shape, and number of passages of the heat exchanger to calculate the temperature profile, pressure drop, and fluid velocities of all three fluids. Global heat exchanger parameters such as the effectiveness and total heat transferred to the sCO2 are then calculated for overall performance. Due to the value and increased use of sCO2 heat exchangers in power cycles, a cost model of the system based on the unique high temperature/high pressure operating conditions was created using quotes from reference projects and market analysis. These quoted air-to-sCO2 heat exchangers are then processed using multiple weighting factors pertinent to heat exchanger design, including heat exchanger type, maximum temperature, differential pressures, fluids, duty, and more. These factors are then used in an exponential function in order to generate a parameterized cost curve. The design and cost of the heat exchanger are then optimized using the SMPSO genetic algorithm in Python. The optimization objectives for the system are to maximize the overall system effectiveness, including an air recuperator for preheating, and to minimize unit costs. Additional constraints are added to the system for the sCO2 and air pressure drops, air velocity to reduce particle entrainment, and the length and volume of the heat exchanger.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/GT/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/GT2022-80558/6936604/v009t28a001-gt2022-80558.pdf",""

We separated the attraction hypothesis into five previously proposed explanations of bat interactions at or near wind turbines, including attraction based on noise, roost sites, foraging and water, mating behavior, and lights, and one new hypothesis regarding olfaction, and provide a state of the knowledge in 2022. Our review indicates that future research should prioritize attraction based on social behaviors, such as mating and scent-marking, as this aspect of the attraction hypothesis has many postulates and remains the most unclear. Relatively more data regarding attraction to wind turbines based on lighting and noise emission exist, and these data indicate that these are unlikely attractants. Analyzing attraction at the species-level should be prioritized because of differences in foraging, flight, and social behavior among bat species. Lastly, research assessing bat attraction at various scales, such as the turbine or facility scale, is lacking, which could provide important insights for both wind turbine siting decisions and bat mortality minimization strategies.

We used insights from this literature review to define and describe the unique nature of thought experiments and offer a taxonomy of four main types based on a theory's development stage (i.e., early vs. late) and a study's theoretical goal (i.e., confirmation vs. disconfirmation). We also provide a decision‐making tree useful for evaluating whether conducting a thought experiment is beneficial for a particular research situation and which of the four types is most likely to produce a meaningful contribution. Then, we offer best‐practice recommendations for conducting thought experiments that address how to plan, execute, report results, and discuss implications. In addition, we demonstrate the potential of thought experiments by using the best‐practice recommendations to design and conduct a thought experiment in the domain of workplace allyship. Finally, we offer suggestions for future substantive research that would benefit from thought experiment methodology (i.e., diversity, equity, and inclusion; leadership; performance; selection and recruitment; teams; and turnover). Overall, our article offers a comprehensive review and recommendations that we hope will be a catalyst for using thought experiments to advance theory in OB and related fields.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/job.2658",""

Different grazing management practices including the continuous season‐long heavy stocking (HS) and light stocking (LS), and adaptive multi‐paddock stocking (MPS) are adopted on rangelands around the world. Studies evaluating the effects of grazing management practices on streamflow characteristics are lacking. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool was used to assess the impacts of HS (24 Animal Units [AU] per 100 ha), LS (12 AU/100 ha), and adaptive MPS (24 AU/100 ha) management practices on hydrological conditions and streamflow characteristics in the Lower Prairie Dog Town Fork Red River watershed in north Texas. The model was calibrated based on 36 years of measured daily streamflow data and then used to assess the variation in hydrological components and streamflow characteristics under different grazing management practices, and no grazing (EX). Results indicated that the adaptive MPS decreased surface runoff by 30.6 and 46.0%, streamflow by 15.6 and 23.6%, and Richards–Baker flashiness Index by 24.1 and 35.9%, while increasing Baseflow Index by 19.7 and 31.6% when compared to the continuous LS and HS, respectively. In addition, changing grazing management from HS or LS to MPS showed a general tendency to decrease the magnitude of high flows and increase the magnitude of low flows, thereby decreasing the frequency of occurrence of floods and droughts. Simulated hydrologic conditions under MPS and EX scenarios were similar. Overall, adaptive MPS was found to be an ideal grazing management practice for water conservation, streamflow stability, and reduction of flood and drought risk.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/rra.3948",""

Pollination mutualisms rely on temporal co‐occurrence of pollinators and their floral resources, and although much work has been done to characterize the shapes of flower phenological distributions, similar studies that include pollinators are lacking. Here, we provide the first broad assessment of skewness, a component of distribution shape, for a bee community. We compare skewness in bees to that in flowers, relate bee and flower skewness to other properties of their phenology, and quantify the potential consequences of differences in skewness between bees and flowers. Both bee and flower phenologies tend to be right‐skewed, with a more exaggerated asymmetry in bees. Early‐season species tend to be the most skewed, and this relationship is also stronger in bees than in flowers. Based on a simulation experiment, differences in bee and flower skewness could account for up to 14% of pairwise overlap differences. Given the potential for interaction loss, we argue that difference in skewness of interacting species is an underappreciated property of phenological change.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ecy.3890",""

While continuing mitotic cell division in the male germline post puberty has been proposed as the major cellular mechanism underlying both patterns, little direct evidence for this role has been found. Understanding the evolution of the per-generation mutation rate among species requires that we identify the molecular mechanisms that change between species. Here, we study the per-generation mutation rate in an extended pedigree of the brown (grizzly) bear, Ursus arctos horribilis. Brown bears hibernate for one-third of the year, a period during which spermatogenesis slows or stops altogether. The reduction of spermatogenesis is predicted to lessen the male mutation bias and to lower the per-generation mutation rate in this species. However, using whole-genome sequencing, we find that both male bias and per-generation mutation rates are highly similar to that expected for a non-hibernating species. We also carry out a phylogenetic comparison of substitution rates along the lineage leading to brown bear and panda (a non-hibernating species) and find no slowing of the substitution rate in the hibernator. Our results contribute to accumulating evidence that suggests that male germline cell division is not the major determinant of mutation rates and mutation biases. The results also provide a quantitative basis for improved estimates of the timing of carnivore evolution.","https://academic.oup.com/gbe/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/gbe/evac148/46201942/evac148.pdf",""

Phylogenomic analyses revealed they belong to four new and one poorly described bacterial phyla. Comparison of their rRNA genes with public databases revealed they are all globally distributed. These novel bacteria are capable of the anaerobic degradation of polysaccharides and proteins, and the respiration of sulfur and nitrogen. These genomes code for an unusually high proportion (~ 9, and up to 20% per genome) of protein families lacking representatives in public databases. Hundreds of these protein families are predicted to be co-localized with genes for sulfur reduction, nitrogen cycling, energy conservation, and the degradation of organic compounds.

Many models have been proposed, and different calibration techniques are used. Often the limitation of these models for accurate prediction arises due to a lack of long-range data incorporating both the low-stress and high-stress regions. This problem is more prominent for novel materials with very little data and may require long-term creep tests, delaying the material’s qualification. Model calibration against short-range data may lead to an inflection during extrapolation. In this study, a datum temperature (DT) calibration method derived from Parametric Numerical Isothermal Datum (P-NID) is compared with the traditional calibration approach for minimum-creep-strain-rate prediction using Norton power law. Minimum-creep-strain-rate data for Inconel 617 at five temperature levels (800 to 1000°C) and stress ranging from 11 to 122 MPa are used. Two different forms of the Norton power law are calibrated using the traditional approach and the most suitable form for Inconel 617 is selected. Next, the model is calibrated using the datum temperature calibration approach. In the datum temperature method, the data from different temperatures are transferred to a datum temperature creating a wide range of parametric data followed by model calibration against the transferred data at datum temperature. Finally, the model is transferred back to the original temperatures. The traditional approach and datum temperature method results are compared in terms of accuracy, calibration techniques, extrapolation, and limitations for Inconel 617. The datum temperature method is found to be accurate, like the traditional approach, however, requires comparatively less effort during calibration since the model is calibrated against a single temperature instead of multiple temperatures. Thus, the material constants are independent of temperature and stress resulting in stable, inflection-free, and reliable extrapolation over the traditional approach. A step-by-step procedure is provided to derive the datum temperature transformation equations and the calibration method. Finally, a general guideline is provided to apply the datum temperature method to any existing models.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/PVP/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/PVP2022-84415/6939959/v04at06a029-pvp2022-84415.pdf",""

A standard, two-link planar robot arm (Fig.1) is chosen to be the plant due to its nonlinear system dynamics and relatively simple inverse kinematics considering the math level of complexity of a typical senior-level mechanical engineering class. To facilitate model-based control design, the system dynamic model is derived through Lagrange’s equations in non-conservative form. An inverse kinematic analysis is also performed to extract the target joint variables to match for a circular motion executed in the task space. Finally, the system dynamic model is incorporated with feedback control designs based on the computed torque and sliding mode control methods. The tracking performance of the proposed nonlinear controllers are validated in closed-loop numerical simulations based on the same target trajectories to compare the performances achieved by the different algorithms.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2022-95524/6981820/v007t09a004-imece2022-95524.pdf",""

Diagnosis and analyses of sound sources at low frequencies have always been a significant challenge because the directivity of low-frequency sound is very poor. To date, there are no research papers and/or reports that have demonstrated low-frequency sources localization and radiation patterns of any kind at high spatial resolution in 3D space. This study shows that by using sound viewer technologies, which include the passive sonic detection and ranging (SODAR), the Helmholtz equation least squares (HELS) method, advanced signal processing, denoising, etc., the locations of sound sources and visualization of the sound fields can be determined with high spatial resolution, even at frequencies below 150 Hz. In particular, the HELS method allows for reconstructing all the acoustic quantities, including the acoustic pressure, time-averaged acoustic intensity, time-averaged acoustic power on the source surfaces and in 3D space. The hardware needed consists of a 3D array with six free-field precision microphones with pre-amplifiers, a miniature wide-angle camera, an eight-channel digital signal processor and a laptop computer.","https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S2591728522500050",""

Students who have not identified their study style or have yet to take classes that are materially‐intensive may perform poorly. Additionally, when anatomy courses are presented online, students’ learning can be impacted further due to the lack of access to typical in‐class learning experiences such as peer interaction and dissection. To address these challenges, this study introduces an active learning technique called Jigsaw to supplement peer‐to‐peer learning in an online, graduate anatomy course. Jigsaw was implemented into an online anatomy course in the Spring of 2021. During Jigsaw, students were split up into expert groups in which they were expected to master a specific topic assigned to them. Students from the expert groups were then put into teaching groups, where each student would teach the other students about the material mastered in their expert group material. A previous study had evaluated Jigsaw within an in‐person classroom environment with positive outcomes. The present study included 72 students who were split into 3 expert groups with 24 students per group. Two students from each expert group were assigned to one of 12 teaching groups, 6 students per group with 2 from each expert group A, B, and C. Students’ attitudes surrounding Jigsaw were then evaluated using post‐unit surveys and a final post‐course survey. Results from the post‐course survey indicated that 77.3% of students were either somewhat satisfied or very satisfied when asked about their satisfaction with Jigsaw. The remaining percent were neutral or negative. The satisfaction score took into account student’s likelihood of using Jigsaw again, as well as how they felt Jigsaw improved their understanding of the material. Jigsaw can serve to provide an outlet for peer interaction and learning that is absent is online classrooms, where students do not meet face‐to‐face and do not have hands‐on dissection. Future studies should also take into account grades as well as student attitudes in an effort to evaluate the usefulness of Jigsaw as a supplemental learning resource. Understanding students’ attitudes surrounding active learning techniques in the classroom can inform future anatomy educators as well as other instructors on assisting students in their learning process, especially in material intensive courses such as anatomy and as online learning becomes more commonplace.","",""

The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) periodically inspects the regional airports in Texas through visual surveys and estimates the pavement condition index (PCI) for each airport on a network scale. These ratings are used to assess the need for rehabilitation in a timely manner. In this study, an attempt was made to use an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mounted with an optical camera to inspect and evaluate the condition of various airport assets. Several observations were outlined to conduct a safe inspection of airport assets using UAVs. A comparison of PCI values, grouped into three categories, obtained from traditional and aerial inspections was made to understand the feasibility of using this new technology for airport asset management. It was observed that both inspections classified most of the airport assets similarly. The traditional inspection was observed to be quicker as it requires inspection of only sampled units, however, UAV data processing takes a relatively long time to offer a comprehensive digital footprint and immersive visualization experience of the whole airport assets.

Notably, MDD is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality. Although the mechanisms are unclear, evidence supports chronic systemic inflammation as a major contributor to CVD risk in older adults with MDD. However, whether an inflammatory phenotype is present in young adults with MDD prior to the onset of CVD and other comorbidities is equivocal. Recent work has implicated the sympathetic nervous system and specifically norepinephrine as a potent driver of inflammation via stimulating an increase in T‐cell mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (T‐cell mitoROS). Given previous findings of elevated plasma norepinephrine and inflammation in MDD, the purpose of this study was to examine the potential for a T‐cell mitoROS pro‐inflammatory pathway in young otherwise healthy adults with MDD. We hypothesized that young adults with MDD but otherwise free of clinical disease would have augmented circulating pro‐inflammatory cytokines and T‐cell mitoROS compared to young healthy adults without MDD (HA). Methods: All participants underwent a structured diagnostic neuropsychiatric interview to determine the presence or absence of MDD based on the DSM‐5 diagnostic criteria for MDD. Systemic pro and anti‐inflammatory cytokines and T‐cell mitoROS were measured in 14 healthy young adults with MDD of mild‐to‐moderate severity (non‐medicated; age: 23±2 years) and 11 HA (age: 22±1 years). Serum cytokines were detected using LEGENDplex Human Essential Immune Response panel and assessed by flow cytometry. Seven serum cytokines related to the norepinephrine‐T‐cell mitoROS‐inflammation pathway were measured. Immune cells were isolated from whole blood by red blood cell lysis. T‐cell mitoROS was measured by labeling with antibodies against CD3+ (total T cells) and mitoROS targeted fluorogenic dye (MitoSoxRED) and assessed by flow cytometry. All data are expressed as mean ± SE. Results: For pro‐inflammatory cytokines, there were no differences between MDD and HA for IL‐6 (41±18 pg/mL; 92± 66 pg/mL, P=0.66), IL‐17A (7±3 pg/mL; 17±8 pg/mL, P=0.13), TNF‐α (19±9 pg/mL; 36±18 pg/mL, P=0.20), IFNγ (120±70 pg/mL; 201±137 pg/mL, P=0.34) or IL‐2 (5±2 pg/mL; 13±6 pg/mL, P=0.25), respectively. Likewise, no differences were found in anti‐inflammatory cytokines between MDD and HA for IL‐10 (18±9 pg/mL; 78±57 pg/mL, P=0.19) or IL‐4 (33±15 pg/mL; 95±46 pg/mL, P=0.13), respectively. In contrast, T‐cell mitoROS was significantly elevated in MDD (34402±13353 a.u) compared to HA (6258±2942 a.u, P<0.05). Conclusion: These preliminary findings suggest T‐cell mitoROS but not circulating cytokine profiles are different between young adults with and without MDD. Thus, an elevated T‐cell mitoROS may represent an early marker of immune system alterations and inflammation in MDD.","",""

Multidrug resistant (MDR) CRAb is a major threat to public health as treatment options are limited. The objective of this study is to elucidate the molecular epidemiology of circulating antibiotic resistance genes causing MDR CRAb infections by using a combination of whole-genome Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (wgMLST) and antibiotic susceptibility phenotyping. Table 1.Molecular characterization of MDR CRAb isolates*The numbers indicate % of sequence identity match for each Beta-lactamase gene. Methods: Bacterial isolates were derived from cultures taken from subjects 48 hours following admission as part of routine clinical care for patients between 2017-2020. Isolates were obtained from 16 hospital units (both ICU and non-ICU) across two hospitals in the Detroit area. Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) was performed using Illumina MiniSeq or Nextseq. WgMLST analysis was performed using BioNumerics software v7.6. ResFinder software was used for analysis of antibiotic resistance genes. Isolates underwent antibiotic susceptibility testing using a broth microdilution method (VITEK2) and Clinical & Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) cut offs. Results: Out of the 95 total isolates, 51(54%) were CRAb isolates and of the CRAb isolates, 21(41%) were MDR CRAb. WgMLST identified that majority of the circulating MDR CRAb isolates belonged to ST2Pas (ST195Ox and ST208Ox) based on CDC definitions (Table 1). MDR CRAb isolates were resistant to 3 different classes of antibiotics including aminoglycosides, fluroquinolones and β-lactams. β-lactamase genes present include (blaADC-25, blaOXA-23, blaOXA-66 and blaTEM1D) for both ST195Ox and ST208Ox and (blaADC-25, blaOXA-23 and blaOXA-223) for ST406Pas (ST310Ox). Among the patients with MDR CRAb infections, most were males with respiratory infections in a non-ICU setting. Conclusion: The study demonstrated a high proportion of isolates belonged to ST2 Pas carrying multiple beta-lactamase genes including blaOXA-23 gene. ST406Pas might be an emerging lineage carrying the blaOXA-23 gene. In addition to stringent infection control measures, continuous surveillance is recommended in limiting the spread of MDR CRAb isolates in the healthcare settings.

Increasing multimorbidity represents a substantial threat to the health of aging populations. Recent trends suggest greater risk of poor health and mortality among later-born cohorts, yet we are unaware of work examining cohort differences in multimorbidity among aging U.S. adults. Methods: We examine intercohort variation in MCC burden in adults aged 51 years and older using 20 years (n = 33,598; 1998–2018) of repeated assessment drawn from the Health and Retirement Study. The index of MCCs included 9 chronic conditions (heart disease, hypertension, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, lung disease, cancer excluding skin cancer, high depressive symptoms, and cognitive impairment). We used linear mixed models with various approaches to estimate age/period/cohort effects to model intercohort patterns in MCC burden. We also explored variation in the specific conditions driving cohort differences in multimorbidity. Results: More recent cohorts had greater MCC burden and developed multimorbidity at earlier ages than those born to prior generations. The burden of chronic conditions was patterned by life-course sociodemographic factors and childhood health for all cohorts. Among adults with multimorbidity, arthritis and hypertension were the most prevalent conditions for all cohorts, and there was evidence that high depressive symptoms and diabetes contributed to the observed cohort differences in multimorbidity risk.

This system, which starts with 6 equipotent cells, encompasses diverse types of developmental event, including developmental competence, multiple signaling events to control precise and faithful patterning of three cell fates, execution and proliferation of specific cell lineages, and a series of sophisticated morphogenetic events. Early events have been subjected to extensive mutational and genetic investigations and later events to cell biological analyses. We infer the existence of dramatically changing profiles of gene expression that accompanies the observed changes in development. Yet, except from serendipitous discovery of several transcription factors expressed in dynamic patterns in vulval lineages, our knowledge of the transcriptomic landscape during vulval development is minimal. This study describes the composition of a vulva-specific transcriptome. We used tissue-specific harvesting of mRNAs via immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged poly(A) binding protein, PAB-1, heterologously expressed by a promoter known to express GFP in vulval cells throughout their development. The identified transcriptome was small but tightly interconnected. From this data set, we identified several genes with identified functions in development of the vulva and validated more with promoter-GFP reporters of expression. For one target, lag-1, promoter-GFP expression was limited but a fluorescent tag of the endogenous protein revealed extensive expression. Thus, we have identified a transcriptome of C. elegans vulval lineages as a launching pad for exploration of functions of these genes in organogenesis.","https://academic.oup.com/g3journal/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/g3journal/jkac091/43711593/jkac091.pdf",""

Strategies to enhance the transformation rate of dietary energy and protein to fish growth are greatly desired by fish culturists. Prebiotic compounds can be used as supplements to human, animal, and fish diets to populate beneficial bacteria in the gut. The goal of the present study is to identify low-cost prebiotic compounds with high efficacy in increasing the absorption of food nutrients by fish. Several oligosaccharides were evaluated as prebiotics in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), one of the most widely cultured species in the world. Several parameters of the fish on different diets were evaluated, including feed conversion ratios (FCRs), enzymatic activities, expression of growth-related genes, and the gut microbiome. Two age groups of fish (30 days old and 90 days old) were used in this study. The results indicated that the addition of xylooligosaccharide (XOS), galactooligosaccharide (GOS), or XOS and GOS combination to the basic fish diet significantly decreased the feed conversion ratio (FCR) of the fish in both age groups. Both XOS and GOS decreased the FCR of 30-day-old fish by 34.4% compared to the fish on the control diet. In the 90-day-old fish group, XOS and GOS decreased the FCR by 11.9%, while the combination of the two prebiotics led to a 20.2% decrease in FCR compared to the control group. The application of XOS and GOS also elevated the production of glutathione-related enzymes and the enzymatic activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPX), indicating the enhancement of antioxidation processes in fish. These improvements were associated with significant changes in the fish gut microbiota. The abundance of Clostridium ruminantium, Brevinema andersonii, Shewanella amazonensis, Reyranella massiliensis, and Chitinilyticum aquatile were upregulated by XOS and GOS supplements. The findings of the present study suggested that the prebiotics would be more effective when they were applied to the younger fish, and the application of multiple oligosaccharide prebiotic compounds could result in a greater growth enhancement. The identified bacteria can be potentially used as probiotic supplements in the future to improve fish growth and feeding efficiency and ultimately reduce the cost of tilapia aquaculture.","http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/anu/2022/5715649.pdf",""

During qualification of metallic AM properties, near-net AM parts are often machined prior to mechanical testing. The aim of this study is to understand the influence of net-shaped tensile coupons without post-AM machining on the accuracy of bulk material properties. The motivation for this study lies in: (1) reducing the qualification time and costs by (2) formulating and validating a correction factor to estimate bulk AM properties from mechanical testing of as-AM coupons. This research focused on the tensile testing of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) produced Inconel 718 to isolate the effects of as-AM surface roughness. Six different surface conditions were produced by varying two different laser processing conditions, with and without contour laser scans. Specimens (n = 5 per condition) were tested in both net-shape and post-AM machined conditions. Surface roughness was analyzed using both stylus contact profilometry and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) non-contact analysis. ANOVA analysis was performed to derive inference on processing conditions and resulting mechanical properties. It was observed that the measurement error in gauge diameter primarily accounts for variability in mechanical properties between machined and net-shape coupons, specifically Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS). This study presents a methodology to determine corrected gauge diameter based on depth of surface roughness. Findings from this study will enable net-shape tensile data to be compared against machined data for accurately predicting the strength of parts with as-AM surfaces. By accounting for surface roughness depth, tensile strength of net-shape AM coupons was within 1% accuracy to that of machined AM coupons.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/MSEC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/MSEC2022-85310/6922649/v002t05a029-msec2022-85310.pdf",""

Although the vaccine elicited neutralizing antibody (nAb) in human volunteers, the minimal antibody titer that is needed to afford protection is unknown. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the minimal nAb titer elicited by the RVFV MP-12 vaccine in human volunteers that protected mice against lethal RVFV challenge as a surrogate assessment of the protective efficacy of the vaccine. Among volunteers who were vaccinated with the MP-12 vaccine during a phase II trial, sera with antibody titers of 1:20 collected 5 years post-vaccination (PV), 1:40 titer collected 2 years PV, and 1:80 titer collected 1 year PV was passively transferred to groups of BALB/c mice. Blood samples were obtained 1 day after passive transfer to determine the RVFV neutralizing nAb titer before challenge with pathogenic RVFV (strain ZH501). Our results indicated that 1 day after passive transfer of the immune sera, an approximate 4-fold reduction in circulating nAb titers was detected in the mice. The presence of RVFV nAb titers in the range of 1:5 to 1:20 were generally protective (75–100% survival). These results suggested that circulating titers of 1:5 or higher offer a high degree of protection by MP-12-elicited antibody in human volunteers. Also, the findings highlighted the value of using the BALB/c mouse RVFV challenge model as a surrogate for evaluating the protective nAb responses elicited by MP-12 and possible use for evaluating the efficacy of other RVFV vaccine candidates.","https://www.ajtmh.org/downloadpdf/journals/tpmd/107/5/article-p1091.xml",""

Due to horizontal transfer from one bacterium to another, AMR genes on plasmids can be easily spread. However, distinguishing whether AMR genes are from plasmids or chromosomes is difficult. Here, we assessed two different approaches for identifying AMR genes on the plasmids of A. baumannii. Table 1.Comparison of informatics and experimental approach in studying AMR genes on plasmids in A. baumannii*Highlights indicate blaOXA-23 genes found in both approaches.*S-Susceptible isolates with no blaOXA-23 gene serve as control Methods: Genomic DNA from 30 clinical isolates was sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 550. Two approaches were applied to identify which AMR genes were on plasmids: isolation of plasmid DNA experimentally using plasmid isolation kit (Qiagen, CA), and deduction of plasmid sequence from genomic DNA using the bioinformatic tool, plasmidSPAdes, which distinguishes the plasmid sequence based on the copy number. AMR genes from both approaches were identified using the open-source AMR database, ResFinder. The AMR gene data obtained from plasmids utilizing each approach were compared based on information from whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. Results: As shown in Table 1, both approaches produced differences in the number of contigs, largest contig size, and number of AMR genes identified. The average number of contigs using plasmidSPAdes with WGS data was 7.4 and the largest contig size was 52939 base pairs, while with isolated plasmid DNA and analyzed by SPAdes was 1025 and 32274 bp, respectively. Plasmid DNA contigs are more fragmented. The average number of AMR genes identified using plasmidSPAdes was 1.2 and using plasmid DNA was 4. AMR information from WGS data showed 73.3% isolates have blaOXA-23, a carbapenem resistant gene. However, blaOXA-23 was found from 40% isolates using plasmidSpades and 50% isolates using plasmid DNA. In 36.7% isolates, blaOXA-23 was found by both approaches. Conclusion: The information obtained by the two approaches for identifying resistance genes on plasmids mostly agreed with some exceptions. The bla OXA-23 identified in both could be on plasmids, while genes not identified from both could be on chromosomes. PlasmidSPAdes was a useful tool to discriminate plasmid sequence from WGS data. Stringent infection control measures can prevent spread of AMR gene containing plasmids in hospital settings.

Therefore, RL-based approaches are widely used in unmanned vehicle systems to solve the HJB equations.

Although beneficial provider–patient communication effects have been associated with concordance, there is minimal evidence for concordance benefits to health outcomes. Methods: A cross‐sectional survey was conducted including 200 Black mothers who had given birth within the last 2 years asking about the perceived racial identity of their birth health provider, whether they preferred to have Black women providers, and the intersection between race and gender concordance on birth outcomes. In addition to race and gender concordance, other variables were tested for their impact on birth satisfaction including respect, trust for the care provider, perceived competence, care provider empathy, and inclusive communication. Results: Forty‐one percent of the mothers in this study were assisted in birth by a Black woman provider. Although patient–provider concordance did not result in measurable health outcomes, it is clear that compared to other studies of birth satisfaction among Black birthing persons, this study showed relatively higher levels of satisfaction, perceived trust, empathy, perceived provider competence, inclusive communication, and equal respect for both concordant and discordant care providers. Conclusions: Although many participants showed a preference for race concordance, participants equally valued respect, competence, and trust with their care providers. Further community‐based research needs to be conducted to examine whether race, gender, and cultural concordance results in other beneficial health outcomes.

However, since SCD is, by definition, based on self-reports, it is unclear whether those who experience memory loss discuss these issues with physicians. Access to regular healthcare can be a catalyst for early detection of SCD because asymptomatic cognitive changes may not be apparent unless directly addressed with primary care physicians (PCP). Further, given the widely-known racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare access, minority adults might be further disadvantaged in healthcare seeking for SCD. Using a large national dataset, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) in 2019, the goals of the study are to a) examine the link between having a PCP and discussing memory issues with physicians and b) examine how race and ethnicity and the availability of PCPs are associated with discussion of SCD. The sample included 7,900 individuals 50 and older who reported SCD in the past year. We conducted a logistic regression adjusting for BRFSS survey weights, missing data, state-level clustering, and a set of covariates. Among those with SCD, those with a PCP were almost twice as likely to discuss their cognitive decline (OR=1.98, p&lt;.001). There was also a significant interaction between Hispanic ethnicity and having a PCP (OR=0.25, p&lt;.05, F=4.65, p=.03). Surprisingly, Hispanics with a PCP were less likely to discuss memory issues compared to Hispanics without one. The findings highlight the significance of routine healthcare service utilization for adults with SCD while providing a nuanced understanding of ethnic differences.","https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/6/Supplement_1/183/48311660/igac059.734.pdf",""

Upon AC’s injury, proinflammatory mediators including interleukin 1β (IL1β) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) play major roles in the onset and progression of OA. The objective of this study was to mechanistically detect and compare the effects of IL1β and LPS, separately, on the morphological and nanomechanical properties of bovine chondrocytes. Cells were seeded overnight in a full serum medium and the next day divided into three main groups: A negative control (NC) of a reduced serum medium and 10 ng/ml IL1ß or 10 ng/ml LPS-modified media. Cells were induced for 24 h. Nanomechanical properties (elastic modulus and adhesion energy) and roughness were quantified using atomic force microscopy. Nitric oxide, prostaglandin 2 (PGE2), and matrix metalloproteinases 3 (MMP3) contents; viability of cells; and extracellular matrix components were quantified. Our data revealed that viability of the cells was not affected by inflammatory induction and IL1ß induction increased PGE2. Elastic moduli of cells were similar among IL1β and NC while LPS significantly decreased the elasticity compared to NC. IL1ß induction resulted in least cellular roughness while LPS induction resulted in least adhesion energy compared to NC. Our images suggest that IL1ß and LPS inflammation affect cellular morphology with cytoskeleton rearrangements and the presence of stress fibers. Finally, our results suggest that the two investigated inflammatory mediators modulated chondrocytes’ immediate responses to inflammation in variable ways.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/bip/article-pdf/doi/10.1116/6.0001986/16495318/051001_1_online.pdf",""

It is possible that a higher pedestrian volume increases the occurrence of jaywalking behavior or encourages more pedestrians to step into the crosswalk when they should not. By contrast, a higher pedestrian volume is highly associated with non-critical near-crash events with right-turn vehicles. Right-turn vehicles often expect that there will be pedestrians crossing, and a higher volume of pedestrian traffic increases a driver’s awareness and caution while turning. The study also found that a longer signal cycle is highly associated with critical near-crash events when the pedestrian volume is low, while a relatively short signal cycle length is highly associated with critical near-crash events when the pedestrian volume is high. During non-peak hours, pedestrians have less tolerance for a relatively longer signal cycle. Moreover, a relatively shorter signal cycle length at peak hours will limit the number of pedestrians that can cross during a cycle and encourage the possibility of pedestrians jaywalking or stepping onto the crosswalk when they should not.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/03611981221136138",""

Accurate splicing of precursor messenger RNA depends on placement and assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) sub-complexes of the spliceosome. Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) studies established a role in splice-site selection for PRE-RNA PROCESSING8 (PRP8), a conserved spliceosome scaffolding protein of the U5 snRNP. However, analogous splice-site selection studies in multicellular eukaryotes are lacking. Such studies are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of alternative splicing, which is extensive in plants and animals but limited in yeast. In this work, we describe an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) prp8a mutant that modulates splice-site selection. We isolated prp8a-14 from a screen for suppressors of pex14-6, which carries a splice-site mutation in the PEROXIN14 (PEX14) peroxisome biogenesis gene. To elucidate Arabidopsis PRP8A function in spliceosome fidelity, we combined prp8a-14 with various pex14 splice-site mutations and monitored the double mutants for physiological and molecular consequences of dysfunctional and functional peroxisomes that correspond to impaired and recovered splicing, respectively. prp8a-14 restored splicing and PEX14 function to alleles with mutations in the exonic guanine of the 5′-splice site but did not restore splicing or function to alleles with mutations in the intronic guanine of 5′- or 3′-splice sites. We used RNA-seq to reveal the systemic impact of prp8a-14 and found hundreds of differentially spliced transcripts and thousands of transcripts with significantly altered levels. Among differentially spliced transcripts, prp8a-14 significantly altered 5′- and 3′-splice-site utilization to favor sites resulting in shorter introns. This study provides a genetic platform for probing splicing in plants and hints at a role for plant PRP8 in splice-site selection.","https://academic.oup.com/plphys/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/plphys/kiac221/43858281/kiac221.pdf",""

Existing research on dose typically utilizes the number of sessions as a variable. In a school setting, there are scheduling limitations, student absences, and other logistical barriers that have the potential to affect the number of sessions for an intervention and, in turn, impact the efficacy of programming. METHODS: This article evaluates the effectiveness of a school‐based, peer‐led adolescent comprehensive sexual health education program, with a focus on dose. A repeated measures MANOVA was used to evaluate the effects of individual difference variables and intervention variables on changes in participants' knowledge and attitudes across 2 time points. Additionally, paired RESULTS: Results indicated that knowledge improved following the intervention, and specifically larger doses, measured in minutes, of the intervention were associated with larger improvements in knowledge. There were no significant effects related to attitudes or behavioral outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the knowledge base by including analysis of how the dose of intervention may impact youth outcomes.

Many voting rules, like plurality, are shown to be vulnerable as the attacker can target specific voters to manipulate the result. What if a local differential privacy (LDP) mechanism is adopted such that the true preference of a voter is never revealed in pre-election polls? In this case, the attacker can only infer stochastic information about a voter's true preference, and this may cause the manipulation of the electoral result significantly harder. The goal of this paper is to provide a quantitative study on the effect of adopting LDP mechanisms on a voting system. We introduce the metric PoLDP (power of LDP) that quantitatively measures the difference between the attacker's manipulation cost under LDP mechanisms and that without LDP mechanisms. The larger PoLDP is, the more robustness LDP mechanisms can add to a voting system. We give a full characterization of PoLDP for the voting system with plurality rule and provide general guidance towards the application of LDP mechanisms.","",""

To study this question, we develop an investment game in which, if the investor chooses to invest, the manager privately observes production costs, chooses their personal pay, and provides a cost report in one of three reporting regimes: aggregated, disaggregated without discretion, or disaggregated with discretion. In Experiment 1, as predicted, managers report lower personal pay under both disaggregated regimes than what they consume under the aggregated regime. Yet, when disaggregated reports allow for discretion, managers misclassify personal pay as production costs to such an extent that their actual consumption is no different than in the aggregated condition. In Experiment 2, we allow managers to choose either an aggregated report or a disaggregated report with discretion. We find that, rather than remaining silent, the vast majority of managers still prefer the opportunity to report on their pay explicitly so that they can use their reporting discretion to appear trustworthy, despite not actually being so. In summary, our evidence suggests a strong weight of preferences for appearing trustworthy in the managers' utility function, a much lower weight for actually being trustworthy, and little evidence that preferences for being honest are strong enough for","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1911-3846.12746",""

At the field scale, pasture management based on ground-level measurements, such as clipping or plate meter, is labor intensive and hampers the assessment of spatial and temporal variability. On the lookout for a solution, this study aimed to estimate marandu palisade grass forage mass based on satellite images using two machine learning (ML) algorithms, Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The experimental area comprised Marandu palisade grass pasture (Brachiaria brizantha ‘Marandu’), summing 33 paddocks (42 ha), receiving or not N fertilization. Pastures were managed under continuous stocking to maintain grazing height fixed at 25 cm during the growing season, using the put-and-take methodology with young beef bulls. Field dataset collection (total forage mass and morphological composition) and satellite images were assessed from Dec/2015 to Mar/2019 during the growing or wet season. The satellite images (Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2) were downloaded from US Geological Survey (USGS, http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov). Six spectral bands (Bd) and five vegetation indices (VI, Table 1) were used as input variables to MLR and ANN models. Datasets were randomly divided into a training set (80%) and a testing set (20%). Analyses were run in Python 3 (version 3.7). ML models are generally data-driven and require a large amount of data for better performance, and the best accuracy was achieved by using all Bd and VIs as input variables for both models (Table 1).

Depending on their cultural background, people respond differently to threats to these two dimensions of honor. In two studies, we examined the effects of morality-focused and competence-focused threats on people’s goal pursuit in two honor cultures (Turkey, Southern United States, and Latinx) and in a dignity culture (Northern United States). In Study 1, Turkish participants were more likely to reject a highly qualified person as a partner in a future task if that person threatened their morality (vs. no-threat), even though this meant letting go of the goal of winning an award. Participants from the U.S. honor and dignity groups, however, were equally likely to choose the people who gave them threatening and neutral feedback. In Study 2, Turkish and U.S. honor participants were more likely to persist in a subsequent goal after receiving a morality threat (vs. no-threat), whereas U.S. dignity participants were more likely to persist in a subsequent goal after receiving a competence threat (vs. no-threat). These results show that people’s responses to honor threats are influenced by the dominant values of their culture and by the tools that are available to them to potentially restore their reputation (e.g., punishing the offender vs. working hard on a different task).

We developed criteria to systematically identify infants with suspected syndromes, grouped by syndrome type and level of effort required for syndrome classification (e.g., text search). We applied this algorithm to the Texas Birth Defects Registry (TBDR) to describe the proportion of infants with syndromes delivered during 1999–2014. We also developed a bias analysis tool to estimate the potential percent bias resulting from including infants with syndromes in studies of risk factors. Among 207,880 cases with birth defects in the TBDR, 15% had suspected syndromes and 85% were assumed to be nonsyndromic, with a range across defect types from 28.5% (atrioventricular septal defects) to 98.9% (pyloric stenosis). Across hypothetical scenarios varying expected parameters (e.g., nonsyndromic proportion), the inclusion of syndromic cases in analyses resulted in up to 50.0% bias in prevalence ratios. In summary, we present a framework for identifying infants with syndromic conditions; implementation might harmonize syndromic classification across registries and reduce bias in association estimates.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ajmg.a.63014",""

Do they, like us humans, experience anticipated or previously experienced pains and pleasures as respectively painful and pleasurable? We review evidence from comparative neuroscience about hippocampus-dependent simulation in relation to this question. Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples and theta oscillations have been found to instantiate previous and anticipated experiences. These hippocampal activations coordinate with neural reward and fear centers as well as sensory and cortical areas in ways that are associated with conscious episodic mental imagery in humans. Moreover, such hippocampal “re- and preplay” has been found to contribute to instrumental decision making, the learning of value representations, and the delay of rewards in rats. The functional and structural features of hippocampal simulation are highly conserved across mammals. This evidence makes it reasonable to assume that internally triggered experiences of hedonic valence (IHVs) are pervasive across (at least) all mammals. This conclusion has important welfare implications. Most prominently, IHVs act as a kind of “welfare multiplier” through which the welfare impacts of any given experience of pain or pleasure are increased through each future retrieval. However, IHVs also have practical implications for welfare assessment and cause prioritization.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/17456916221120425",""

Then we expose the samples to CO2 in a supercritical state (ScCO2) for 21 days. We obtain the post-treatment properties of the microbially-treated samples and analyze the effect of the modified properties on long-term CO2 storage in the carbonate formation. Our results indicate that in hydrocarbon-depleted carbonate reservoirs, microbially-altered properties can enhance mechanical integrity and provide potential long-term security for stored CO2. 1 INTRODUCTION: Carbon capture and storage (CCS) in geologic formations is a key technology for climate change to mitigate anthropogenic CO2 emission (Holloway, 1997; Lackner, 2003; Lebedev et al., 2017; Badghaish and Schwartz, 2021; Kolawole et al., 2021a; Ozotta et al., 2021a; Schwartz, 2022). Geologic media such as saline aquifers (Langenfeld et al., 2017a), limestone (Gozalpour et al., 2005; Lebedev et al., 2017), sandstone, basalt (Langenfeld et al., 2017b; Menefee and Ellis, 2021), and shale (Fatah et al., 2021a, 2021b; Kolawole et al., 2021a, 2021b, 2021c; Onwumelu et al., 2021; Ozotta et al., 2021a, 2021b, 2021c) are potential target CO2 storage reservoirs.","https://onepetro.org/ARMAUSRMS/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.56952/ARMA-2022-0028/3063917/arma-2022-0028.pdf",""

That is, there is a group of people with mental disorders who are effectively resilient from victimization, but the ways in which resiliency is produced is not known. Using the National Comorbidity Study–Adolescent supplement data, the applicability of numerous resiliency models is examined to identify and understand how the resiliency from victimization process operates for people with mental disorders. Building off previous work, factors specific to mental illness are also included in additional models to examine whether the same factors relate to resiliency for people with mental illness as they do for other samples. Results indicate support for the compensatory and protective-protective resilience models when mental health-specific factors are excluded from the analyses.

Black and African-American ( N = 338) individuals participated in a three (colorblind, implicit, or explicit ROP-type) × two (Black or White recruiter) message processing experiment. Statistical analyses revealed that implicit race-acknowledged ROP messages were comparable to a colorblind condition in terms of organizational attraction and motivation to join the organization. Furthermore, an implicit race-acknowledged ROP message was associated with higher intention to accept a job offer than an explicit race-acknowledged ROP.

We argue that policy risk negatively affects acquisition completion, but the strength of the effect is dependent on home‐host country relations. Home‐host country relations underpin host governments' motivation to commit to policies and influence foreign acquirers' perceptions of the credibility of such commitments. Using longitudinal event data on intercountry interactions, we measure the valence and strength of home‐host country relations and examine the relationship between policy risk and cross‐border acquisition (CBA) completion under cooperative, conflictive, and ambivalent relations. In a sample of 26,124 CBAs, we find that the relationship is negative and strong under conflictive relations, weaker under cooperative relations, and weakest under ambivalent relations. Managerial Summary: We examine whether acquirers can use intercountry relations to infer and predict host governments' credibility of commitment to policies and evaluate the risk of arbitrary or opportunistic policy changes. Results show that policy risk decreases the likelihood of CBA completion, but the effect depends on home‐host country relations. The negative effect of policy risk is strongest under conflictive intercountry relations, weaker under cooperative relations, and weakest under ambivalent relations. Executives' evaluations of home‐host country relations in high policy risk environments can help assess the risk associated with completing CBAs and develop appropriate strategies to address potential issues.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/gsj.1460",""

Hope is a cognitive–motivational construct that includes three components: hopeful future expectations (HFEs), intentional self‐regulation (ISR), and connection, and is associated with academic achievement and career pursuit; it has not been examined in relation to STEM. This study fills a gap in the literature by taking a multimethod approach to understanding the association between adolescents' hope and STEM career interests. Methods: Participants were 639 middle‐ and high‐school adolescents in the southwestern United States who quantitatively reported their hope and STEM career interests and provided qualitative descriptions of reasons for wanting to pursue a STEM career. Results: Quantitatively, HFEs significantly and positively predicted STEM career interest. Relations were examined by gender and school level. For middle‐school girls, ISR significantly predicted STEM career interest, for middle‐school boys and high‐school girls, HFEs positively significantly predicted STEM career interest, but results of high‐school boys were nonsignificant. Qualitatively, adolescents mentioned reasons aligning with HFEs and ISR as motivations for pursuing a STEM career, as well as prosocial motivations. Additionally, they discussed their interest in a STEM career as a way to pursue other goals such as financial stability. Discussion: Findings highlight the possibility of hope as a malleable motivation for STEM career pursuit. Our findings support the components of hope as a salient associate of early STEM career interest, with adolescents who have high HFEs and ISR being particularly apt to say they would like to pursue a STEM career. Our results support the active development of hope among US adolescents as a catalyst toward personal and global success.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jad.12094",""

Presumptive tests are often used first to detect blood traces; however, they require confirmation, are destructive, and are susceptible to false positives. This study aims to develop a method of collection and identification for nonhuman blood using biosynthesized SERS swabs as a more accurate, specific, and nondestructive detection technique. Silver nanoparticles were synthesized directly on nylon swabs using a biosynthesis reaction and curcumin as the reducing agent to form the nanoparticles. The detection of bovine blood was investigated by analyzing decreasing volumes of blood swabbed with the surface‐enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) swabs. Although swabbing 30 and 20 μl of blood resulted in the most resolved spectra, swabbing 10 μl of blood still produced identifiable peaks. Wetted swabs were used to analyze dried bovine bloodstains on cotton fabrics and glass slides: The spectra collected when swabbing the bloodstain on the glass sides had a higher signal‐to‐noise ratio than on fabrics. The SERS swabs were subsequently used to collect and analyze horse and sheep blood. Although Raman bands characteristic of blood were identifiable for each specie, showing that the SERS swabs allowed the successful detection of the three animal blood species, the spectra from the three species could not be differentiated. This study demonstrates the efficiency of the biosynthesis to grow nanoparticles on the swabs and shows their viability to be used as SERS substrates to collect and identify animal blood.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jrs.6479",""

During this procedure, distal guide catheter placement within the venous sinuses may be desirable to facilitate stent delivery. We report our initial experience using the TracStar LDP™ (Imperative Care, Campbell, USA, 0.088-inch inner diameter) as the guide catheter for intracranial access during venous sinus stenting. Methods: A multi-institutional retrospective chart review of a prospectively maintained IRB-approved database was performed. Consecutive patients who underwent venous sinus stenting from 1/1/2020-9/6/2021 for IIH were included. Patient characteristics, procedural details, TracStar distal reach, outcomes, and complications were collected and analyzed. Results: Fifty-eight patients were included. The mean age was 33.8 years and 93.1% of patients were female. Visual changes prompted evaluation in 86.2% of patients. Stent placement was successful in all patients. The TracStar LDP catheter was advanced to the location of stent placement in 97.9% of cases in which it was attempted. The large 0.088-inch inner diameter lumen enabled compatibility with all desired stent sizes ranging from six to 10 millimeters. Gradient pressure across transverse sinus stenosis dropped from an average of 19.5 mmHg pre-procedure to 1.7 mmHg post-stent placement (p < 0.001). Clinical improvement was achieved in 87.9% (51/58) of patients. There were no catheter-related complications. Conclusion: The TracStar LDP is a safe and effective access platform for reaching treatment locations in patients who present with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and who are candidates for venous sinus stent placement.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/15910199221139545",""

Naturally, assuming this dynamic to exist lends support for a significant expansion of police operations from traditional crime control to order maintenance. More specifically, the advocates of the theory presume that citizens view disorder and crime as two distinctive constructs, and further that the former triggers the latter. Broken windows theory was quite popular during the 1990s and early 2000s, a period in which order maintenance or quality of life policing reached its apex of popularity. Findings from recent studies on public perceptions of disorder and crime, however, have called into serious question: the cognitive distinction between crime and disorder. Using data collected from a random telephone survey of residents residing in the Houston metropolitan area, we follow this line of research and test the hypothesized dynamics underlying broken windows theory. Our principal findings suggest that neither a one-factor model (convergent) nor a two-factor model (discriminant) fit the empirical data when an appropriate concept validation process is carried out. Implications are drawn for broken windows theory and some specific recommendations are made for future research at the end of the study.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0306624X221124856",""

Closed‐form solutions to ray‐path equations for graded‐index waveguides are shown to offer important insights into image‐transmission properties of GRIN fibers, suggesting useful recipes for optimized GRIN‐fiber‐based deep‐brain imaging. We show that the lengths of GRIN imaging components intended for deep‐brain studies in freely moving rodents need to be chosen as a tradeoff among the spatial resolution, the targeted imaging depth and the degree of fiber‐probe invasiveness. In the experimental setting that we present in this paper, the head of an awake mouse with a GRIN‐fiber implant is fixed under a microscope objective, but the mouse is free to move around an in‐house‐built flat‐floored air‐lifted platform, exploring a predesigned environment, configured as an arena for one of standard cognitive tests. We show that cellular‐resolution deep‐brain imaging can be integrated in this setting with robust cell‐specific optical neural recording to enable in vivo studies with minimal physical restraints on animal models. The enhancement of the information capacity of the fluorescence signal, achieved via a suitable filtering of the GRIN‐fiber readout, is shown to open routes toward practical imaging modalities whereby the deep‐brain neuronal dynamics and axonal connections underpinning the integrative functions of essential brain structures can be studied in awake rodent models.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jbio.202200025",""

This evidence is important because prior literature documents mixed evidence on whether political connections reduce the threat of SEC enforcement. By studying earnings management with a large sample, our study provides more generalizable insights into the effects of political connections on enforcement. We argue that politically connected firms face a lower threat of enforcement, which reduces the costs of accrual‐based earnings management and alters the trade‐off between real and accrual‐based earnings management. Consistent with our predictions, using a single‐step estimation method as well as a difference‐in‐differences test based on an exogenous shock, we find that connected firms engage in more accrual management and less real earnings management. Our results are driven by firms that have relatively high costs of real earnings management. Furthermore, we find that political connections mitigate the relation between SEC comment letters and earnings management. Overall, the evidence is consistent with politically connected firms facing a lower threat of regulatory enforcement and using this flexibility to increase accrual‐based earnings management and reduce real earnings management that is potentially value destructive. Our study complements and strengthens inferences in prior work that documents evidence of lax SEC enforcement for politically connected firms using small samples. Our findings should be of interest to policy‐makers, regulators, and other professionals that are interested in understanding the effects of political connections.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1911-3846.12811",""

The expression of MDM2 is elevated in cancer cells and inhibitors of MDM2 showed potent anticancer activities. Many inhibitors target the p53 binding domain of MDM2. However, inhibitors such as Inulanolide A and MA242 are found to bind the RING domain of MDM2 to block ubiquitin transfer. In this report, crystal structures of MDM2 RING domain in complex with Inulanolide A and MA242 were solved. These inhibitors primarily bind in a hydrophobic site centered at the sidechain of Tyr489 at the C‐terminus of MDM2 RING domain. The C‐terminus of MDM2 RING domain, especially residue Tyr489, is required for ubiquitin discharge induced by MDM2. The binding of these inhibitors at Tyr489 may interrupt interactions between the MDM2 RING domain and the E2‐Ubiquitin complex to inhibit ubiquitin transfer, regardless of what the substrate is. Our results suggest a new mechanism of inhibition of MDM2 E3 activity for a broad spectrum of substrates.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/pro.4367",""

We find that NPEs' total incentives decrease following the end of a tournament based on evidence of their reduced future promotion prospects and limited adjustments to their compensation. Consistent with the theory that NPEs leave in response to this loss in incentives, results indicate that turnover is higher for NPEs who: (1) are ex ante more competitive for promotion, (2) compete in open tournaments without an heir apparent versus closed tournaments with an heir apparent winner, and (3) compete in tournaments with an outsider versus insider winner. Departed NPEs' subsequent career outcomes suggest that the labor market assesses NPEs who leave after open tournaments more favorably than those who leave after closed tournaments and tournaments with an outsider winner. Overall, evidence suggests that promotion tournaments can weed out low-quality managers, but also cause the unintended turnover of high-quality managers.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article-pdf/97/6/123/81045/i1558-7967-97-6-123.pdf",""

There is a critical need to identify subgroups at high risk of experiencing treatment‐related toxicities. However, this remains quite challenging from a statistical perspective as there are a variety of clinical risk factors that may be relevant for different types of adverse events, and adverse events of interest may be rare or incompletely reported. We frame this challenge as a variable selection problem and propose a Bayesian hierarchical model which incorporates a horseshoe prior on the interaction terms to identify high‐risk groups. Our proposed model is motivated by a meta‐analysis of adverse events in cancer immunotherapy, and our results uncover key factors driving the risk of specific types of treatment‐related adverse events.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jrsm.1597",""
