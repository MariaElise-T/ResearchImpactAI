The low toxicity levels of these nanoparticles as well as their ability to interact with biomolecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids, is a key feature for gene therapy applications using nanotechnology. Previous studies have shown that single‐stranded and double‐stranded oligonucleotides and plasmid DNAs bind well to these nanoparticles. Binding of RNA, however, has not been extensively studied. With RNAi becoming an important potential gene therapy tool, finding suitable drug delivery vehicles for siRNAs is of crucial importance. In our studies, we have evaluated the binding efficiency of different types of RNAs (ssRNA, dsRNA, and complex RNA structures) to different nanoparticles and compared them to DNA binding studies with the same nanoparticles. In initial studies focusing on the layered double hydroxide hydrotalcite, a combination of physical and molecular biological assays was employed to assess binding to DNAs and RNAs with different structures. In addition, competition and displacement studies were performed using anionic salts such as carbonate, sulfate, and phosphate to further study the exchange capacity and the binding affinity of one over the other of these anions with the RNAs of interest.

Large animals might have more fluid in the gut to facilitate nutrient transfer between the gut lumen and the gut wall. Furthermore, relationships between concentrations of dietary refractory and indigestible fiber (CRIF) and gut fill might indicate whether chemostatic factors or physical distension of the gut affects food intake. We collected white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus (Zimmermann, 1780); 122 males, 152 females) from three sites in central and south Texas that varied in diet quality as indexed by rumen–reticulum crude protein concentrations. Large animals did not have more fluid in their rumina–reticula than small animals because the scalar between body mass and wet mass of rumen–reticulum contents was not greater than the scalar estimated for dry mass of rumen–reticulum contents. We expected a positive or an inverse relationship when rates of forage comminution, digestion, and particle passage were high or low, respectively. At the site where deer had access to a high-quality pelleted diet, we detected a positive relationship between CRIF and dry mass. At sites with free-ranging deer and lower quality diets, relationships between CRIF and dry fill were inversely related. Food intake of deer was probably influenced by chemostatic factors at the site with a high-quality pelleted diet and by physical distension of the gut at the other two sites.","http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/full-xml/10.1139/cjz-2014-0286",""

Leveraging that assertions should be side effect free, our approach distributes assertion checking into simpler sub-problems---each focusing on checking one single assertion, so that different assertions are checked in parallel among multiple workers. Furthermore, the sub-problem analysis performed by each worker is guided by the checked assertion to avoid irrelevant path exploration and is prioritized based on the distance towards the checked assertion to provide earlier feedback.

Drawing from the two‐stage turnaround model and insights from the literature on downward spirals in organizations, we develop and test a theoretical model that explains how temporal considerations in retrenchment influence the likelihood of successful turnaround. Using a matched pair sample of 96 US firms, we find that declining firms that implement retrenchment actions early have a higher likelihood of successful turnaround. The findings also indicate that while two specific retrenchment actions, early divestments and early geographic market exits, significantly contribute to the likelihood of successful turnaround, early layoffs do not. Overall, the findings shed some light on the importance of timing strategic actions in organizational turnarounds.

To identify near-duplicates in large-scale text data, the shingling algorithm has been widely used. This algorithm is based on occurrences of contiguous subsequences of tokens in two or more sets of information, such as in documents. In other words, if there is a slight variation among documents, the overall performance of the algorithm decreases. Therefore, to increase the efficiency and accuracy performances of the shingling algorithm, we propose a hybrid approach that embeds Jaro distance and statistical results of word usage frequency for fixing the ill-defined data.

These instances included four cases in which a reversal occurred simultaneously in all crime categories and subcategories. This finding suggests the need for caution when using clearance rates as a comparative measure of police performance, particularly between jurisdictions or time periods with different crime mixes. Criminal justice researchers, policy makers, and crime analysts should be aware of Simpson’s paradox and its potential effect on aggregated data.

Methods: Data were taken from 1999 to 2009 from the Texas Birth Defects Registry (TBDR), a statewide active surveillance program. We used Poisson regression to generate crude and adjusted measures of association; the latter included models with all variables and with a parsimonious subset of variables. Results: There were 1694 cases with any of the phenotypes in the panel, 1100 cases in a subpanel with ≥90% of cases thought to arise de novo, 523 with chromosomal deletion disorders, and 243 with imprinting disorders. In the most parsimonious models, there was an increasing time trend in all groups except imprinting ( Conclusion: This study suggests that birth defects arising by new mutation may be more prevalent among offspring of older parents and in plural births. The increasing time pattern and race/ethnic pattern may be related to greater use of or access to genetic tests. This approach to mutation epidemiology seems feasible for birth defects registries to consider.Birth Defects Research (Part A), 2015. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, the risk of maltreatment is unknown for children with specific types of birth defects. This study was conducted to determine whether the risk and predictors of maltreatment differ between children with and without 3 birth defects: Down syndrome, cleft lip with/without cleft palate, and spina bifida. METHODS:: This population-based study of substantiated childhood maltreatment was conducted in Texas from 2002 to 2011. Linked data were used to describe the risk and types of maltreatment that occurred before age 2 years in children with and without specific birth defects. Poisson regression was used to identify predictors of maltreatment and assess differences in those predictors between children with and without these specific birth defects. RESULTS:: The risk of maltreatment (any type) in children with cleft lip with/without cleft palate and spina bifida was increased by 40% and 58%, respectively, compared with children with no birth defects. The risk of any maltreatment was similar between children with Down syndrome and unaffected children. Across birth defect groups, the risk of medical neglect was 3 to 6 times higher than in the unaffected group. Child-, family-, and neighborhood-level factors predicted maltreatment in children with and without birth defects. CONCLUSIONS:: The overall risk of substantiated maltreatment was significantly higher for some but not all birth defect groups. The factors associated with increased risk were similar across groups. Enhancement of existing maltreatment prevention and early intervention programs may be effective mechanisms to provide at-risk families additional support.","https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-pdf/136/6/e1504/1062617/peds_2015-1274.pdf",""

Based on the United Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, a model that explains predictors of intention to adopt sustainable household technology was developed and tested via an online survey of 592 US consumers. The results from structural equation modelling demonstrate that product attributes of sustainable household technology including performance, compatibleness and hedonic expectancy as well as consumer characteristics, in specific, sustainable innovativeness significantly predicts adoption intent. Conversely, the model testing shows that effort expectancy as well as social pressure and environmentalism are not significant predictors of adoption intention Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fijcs.12217",""

In this study, the transient temperature distribution within and around parts being fabricated via SLM is numerically simulated and the results are provided to aid in quantify the SLM heat transfer. In order to verify simulation output, and to estimate actual thermal gradients and heat transfer, experiments were separately conducted within a SLM machine using a substrate with embedded thermocouples.

Brine leakage from the injection zone to an above-zone interval will induce a temperature increase as a result of geothermal gradient. Leakage of CO2 can induce a temperature decrease owing to the Joule-Thompson effect associated with pressure drop toward shallow zones. A larger pressure drop at shallower depths is associated with more CO2 expansion upon leakage and could induce more cooling and, hence, a stronger temperature signal. We investigate the strength of the temperature signal as a function of depth for two scenarios in which either a well or a fault acts as leakage pathway. The hydraulic properties of the leakage pathway, modeled as a fractured medium or as a porous medium, also impact the results. Using dual-porosity and dual-permeability models for which CO2 relative permeability and average absolute permeability are modeled higher than in the simple porous medium case, we study the effect of fractures on the temperature signal. The leakage rate increases significantly for dual medium models. However, the temperature change in above-zone interval does not change much as it depends on the pressure gradient which is reduced compared to the single-porosity medium case.","http://onepetro.org/CMTCONF/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.7122/439293-MS/1330513/cmtc-439293-ms.pdf",""

This study analyzed aggregated data on hospital charges and length of stay for a large, diverse population. Methods: We extracted hospitalization data for children diagnosed with birth defects from the Texas Hospital Inpatient Discharge Public Use Data File (2001−2010). Analyses compared total charges and length of stay for children with and without a diagnosis code of any birth defect among 45 standard categories. We also examined trends for total charges by expected payer type. Results: In Texas, 431,296 hospital stays were reported for children with birth defects, with total charges of $24.8 billion. Mean hospital stay for children with birth defects was more than twice that of those without, whereas mean of hospital total charges was approximately six times greater. Pyloric stenosis accounted for the largest number of hospitalizations, followed by certain cardiac defects. Pediatric hospitalizations for birth defects increased 273.7%, compared with a 214.7% increase overall. The percentage of charges with Medicaid as expected payer (2004–2010) ranged from 56.5 to 62.0%. Conclusion: Charges associated with these conditions are far greater than those associated with pediatric hospitalizations for other causes, whether in the newborn period or beyond.

It specifically focuses on training related to five goals, including views about training to make science messages understandable, as well as attitude‐focused training meant to build trust and credibility, to demonstrate that one listens to the public, to demonstrate that one cares about the public's views, and to frame messages to resonate with audiences' pre‐existing values. The theory of planned behavior and procedural justice theory were used to identify potential predictors of views about training toward these goals. Results show that the scientists rate message comprehension and credibility most favorably and give their lowest rating to training related to framing. Regression analyses reveal that believing that public engagement can make a difference (external efficacy) and belief in the ethicality of specific goals were the best predictors of whether scientists saw value in goal‐oriented training. The results suggest that communication trainers might benefit from emphasizing the effectiveness and ethicality of engagement activities if they want to attract scientists to communication training, and that more work may need to be done by professional organizations to help scientists consider the value of thinking about communication goals beyond the traditional focus on message comprehension. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We investigate whether recent efforts by the American Accounting Association, among others, have altered these trends. We examine concentration trends in top accounting journals from 1990 to 2014 and compare these trends with those in other major business school disciplines. Ratios of publications to faculty are lowest for accounting across all years, suggesting that accounting has relatively fewer “slots” available for top journal publications than other disciplines. In addition, our results suggest that concentration has decreased in accounting journals in recent years but that concentration has also decreased in other business disciplines. Thus, accounting has retained its position as a discipline where publications in top journals seem more difficult to attain relative to other business disciplines.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-horizons/article-pdf/30/1/63/15280/acch-51271.pdf",""

Wind Energy has been the leading source of renewable energy development for the past several years. The biggest issue with wind energy are wind turbine (WT) drivetrain failures. The gearbox fails after three to seven years of operation while the expected lifetime of the WT is 20 years. The application to the automotive industry inspired the use of continuously variable transmissions (CVT) in a WT. The CVT considered in this study is the Nu-Vinci CVT technology, a Continuously Variable Planetary (CVP) transmission, designed by Fallbrook Technologies. This technology was selected because of its planetary configuration and its ability to transmit larger amounts of torque, which is required for WT applications. The goal of this research was to reduce the Cost of Energy (COE) by increasing the reliability of CVTs in WTs. In this study, two WT systems, one with CVT as the third stage (referred as ‘WT with CVT’) and another with three stage standard gearbox (referred as ‘WT with SG’), are considered. The research question in this study is ‘Does the use of CVTs improve the reliability of drivetrains of WTs?’ To answer this question three specific aims were developed. First, a computational framework had to be developed. Second, a probabilistic dynamic analysis was conducted. Third, a probabilistic analysis on the COE was performed. A computational framework was developed to guide the probabilistic analysis to determine power values and COE. The probability that the generator torque of the WT with CVT will be less than that of the WT with SG is found to be 50.67%. It was also shown that provided the same input speed and torque, the WT with CVT has a slightly higher power generation. In addition, it was shown that there is 54% probability that the WT with CVT will exhibit lower COE than WT with SG. The higher power production is attained while decreasing the COE. From these results, it can be inferred that the reliability of the drivetrain is improved using a CVT.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2015-52803/4267039/v06at07a061-imece2015-52803.pdf",""

Specific injuries at the elbow and glenohumeral joints have been linked to several kinetic variables throughout the throwing motion. However, very little research has directly examined the relationship between these kinetic variables and ball velocity. Objective: To examine the correlation of peak ball velocity with elbow-valgus torque, shoulder external-rotation torque, and shoulder-distraction force in a group of collegiate baseball pitchers. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Motion-analysis laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: Sixty-seven asymptomatic National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I baseball pitchers (age = 19.5 ± 1.2 years, height = 186.2 ± 5.7 cm, mass = 86.7 ± 7.0 kg; 48 right handed, 19 left handed). Main Outcome Measure(s): We measured peak ball velocity using a radar gun and shoulder and elbow kinetics of the throwing arm using 8 electronically synchronized, high-speed digital cameras. We placed 26 reflective markers on anatomical landmarks of each participant to track 3-dimensional coordinate data. The average data from the 3 highest-velocity fastballs thrown for strikes were used for data analysis. We calculated a Pearson correlation coefficient to determine the associations between ball velocity and peak elbow-valgus torque, shoulder-distraction force, and shoulder external-rotation torque (P &lt; .05). Results: A weak positive correlation was found between ball velocity and shoulder-distraction force (r = 0.257; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.02, 0.47; r2 = 0.066; P = .018). However, no significant correlations were noted between ball velocity and elbow-valgus torque (r = 0.199; 95% CI = −0.043, 0.419; r2 = 0.040; P = .053) or shoulder external-rotation torque (r = 0.097; 95% CI = −0.147, 0.329; r2 = 0.009; P = .217). Conclusions: Although a weak positive correlation was present between ball velocity and shoulder-distraction force, no significant association was seen between ball velocity and elbow-valgus torque or shoulder external-rotation torque. Therefore, other factors, such as improper pitching mechanics, may contribute more to increases in joint kinetics than peak ball velocity.","http://meridian.allenpress.com/jat/article-pdf/50/6/629/1616551/1062-6040-50_1_06.pdf",""

Examples include the analysis of exact time sequences of various kinematic events in damped harmonic motion, sense-making about the phase difference between a driving force and the resulting motion, and understanding the discrepancy between the resonant frequency and the natural undamped frequency for forced, damped harmonic motion.

Nontraditional activities such as rock climbing or rodeo are typically less training structured and coach structured; individualism, self-determination, and autonomy are more prevalent than observed in athletes in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)-sponsored sports. The limited research available on nontraditional athletes has provided the athletic trainer little insight into the coping skills and adaptations to stressors that these athletes may bring into the clinical setting, especially among the growing number of women participating in these types of activities. A better understanding of the pain-coping traits of nontraditional competitors would enhance insight and triage procedures while heading off potential athlete-related risk factors in the clinical setting.

Thus, this posed the need of an improved framework and brought the following research question: Can a probabilistic method be used to improve the quantification of uncertainty in sketches? Accordingly, to answer this research question the following specific aims were established: 1) Ranking of features in a sketch, 2) Determination of the probability of importance of features in a sketch, and 3) Quantification of uncertainty in a sketch. The first aim focused on determining and classifying the features in a sketch, based on a hierarchical approach. The second aim focused on determining the probability of importance of the features in a sketch, by assessing its probability of likeliness using an object recognition approach, and by applying a probability transformation. The third aim focused on the quantification of the uncertainty in a sketch, based on the calculation and normalization of the sketch’s entropy. This resulted in the development of an improved framework for the quantification of uncertainty in sketches, which can be used by design practitioners with limited experience, and whose application is presented and detailed in a case study.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2015-52807/4266091/v011t14a027-imece2015-52807.pdf",""

Due to the poor strength properties of pure plastic materials, there is a critical need to improve mechanical properties for FDM-fabricated pure plastic parts. One of the possible methods is adding reinforced materials (such as carbon fibers) into plastic materials to form carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) composites. The investigation in this paper is going to test if the properties of CFRP composites part will be enhanced compared with pure plastic part made by FDM. There are three major steps in this paper including producing thermoplastic matrix CFRP composites filaments extruded after blending plastic pellets and carbon fiber powder, printing parts in FDM process, and conducting tensile test. Effects of carbon fiber content and length on the mechanical properties (tensile strength, Young’s modulus, toughness, ductility, and yield strength) of specimens are investigated.

GA airports account for almost 90% of the airports in the Texas Airport System Plan. To protect their initial investment in asphalt and concrete pavements, GA airports are expected to perform routine pavement maintenance. For this case study of pavement maintenance practices at GA airports in Texas, GA airport managers were contacted and interviewed about treatments used at their facilities and about the process of having the work done. Respondents were asked to rank the effectiveness of specific maintenance treatments for asphalt and concrete pavements on a Likert-type scale, as well as marking type, retexturing methods, and rubber and contaminant removal methods. Information about the level at which pavement maintenance decisions were made, the process, and the additional data desired (specifically about pavements) was obtained through open-ended questions. The results show that crack sealing and slurry sealing are the two most commonly used maintenance treatments—in a reactive manner. The results also indicate that most GA airport managers rely on the Aviation Division of the Texas Department of Transportation or an engineering firm to manage the airfield pavement and do not take an active approach to implementing routine preventive maintenance. This reliance was the result of two factors: (a) level of knowledge, of both the airport managers and those approving funding, and (b) availability of funding.

HTX has widely divergent population‐based estimates of prevalence, racial and ethnic predominance, and mortality in current literature. Methods: The objective of this study was to use a population‐based registry to investigate potential racial and ethnic disparities in HTX. Using the Texas Birth Defects Registry, we described clinical features and mortality of HTX among infants delivered from 1999 to 2006. We calculated birth prevalence and crude prevalence (cPR) ratios for infant sex, maternal diabetes, and sociodemographic factors. Results: A total of 353 HTX cases were identified from 2,993,604 births (prevalence ratio = 1.18 per 10,000 live births. HTX prevalence was approximately 70% higher among infants of Hispanic and non‐Hispanic black mothers and 28% higher among female infants (cPR = 1.28; 95% confidence interval,1.04–1.59). There was a twofold higher female preponderance for infants of mothers who were non‐Hispanic white or black. Mothers with diabetes were three times more likely to have a child with HTX compared with nondiabetics (cPR = 3.13; 95% confidence interval, 2.12–4.45). Among nondiabetics, HTX cases were 86% more likely to have a Hispanic mother and 72% a non‐Hispanic black mother. First‐year mortality for live born children with HTX was 30.9%. Conclusion: This study represents one of the largest population‐based studies of HTX to date, with a novel finding of higher rates of HTX among Hispanic infants of mostly Mexican origin, as well as among female infants of only non‐Hispanic white and black mothers. These findings warrant further investigation.Birth Defects Research (Part A), 2015. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

As the adoption of such services grows, firms implementing such practices face some operational challenges. One important challenge lies in the complexity associated with the personalization process and how to deploy available resources to handle such complexity. The complexity is exacerbated when a site faces a large volume of requests in a short amount of time, as is often the case for e-commerce and content delivery sites. In such situations, it is generally not possible for a site to provide perfectly personalized service to all requests. Instead, a firm can provide differentiated service to requests based on the amount of profiling information available about the visitor. We consider a scenario where the revenue function is concave, capturing the diminishing returns from personalization effort. Using a batching approach, we determine the optimal scheduling policy (i.e., time allocation and sequence of service) for a batch that accounts for the externality cost incurred when a request is provided service before other waiting requests. The batching approach leads to sunk costs incurred when visitors wait for the next batch to begin. An optimal admission control policy is developed to prescreen new request arrivals. We show how the policy can be implemented efficiently when the revenue function is complex and there are a large number of requests that can be served in a batch. Numerical experiments show that the proposed approach leads to substantial improvements over a linear approximation of the concave revenue function. Interestingly, we find that the improvements in firm profits are not only (or primarily) due to the different service times that are obtained when using the nonlinear personalization function—there is a ripple effect on the admission control policy that incorporates these optimized service times, which contributes even more to the additional profits than the service time optimization by itself.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2764920",""

An instrument was developed to measure the influences of these factors on students’ intentions and relevant scholarly productivity. A total of 281 graduate students from a large, comprehensive university in the southwest United States participated in the survey. Descriptive statistics reveal that around two-thirds of graduate students have no co-authored manuscripts submitted for publication since they started graduate school. Factor analyses validated the factor structure of the instrument, and the results of Structural Equation Modeling show that (a) graduate students’ attitudes towards team research have a positive correlation with their attitudes towards individual research; (b) attitude towards team research, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control, along with students’ discipline/major areas and classification, account for 58% of the variance in the intention to conduct team research; and (c) subjective norm appears to be the most influential factor in the model, followed by attitude; while perceived behavioral control is not of much importance. These findings provide implications for academic departments and programs to promote graduate students’ team research.

The capillary pressure is high in unconventional reservoirs due to the small pores in the rock, so including the effect of capillary pressure on phase behavior is necessary for reliable modeling of unconventional shale gas and tight oil reservoirs. We show that the tangent plane distance method cannot be used to determine phase stability and present a rigorous thermodynamic analysis to determine phase stability with capillary pressure. We then demonstrate that there is a maximum capillary pressure (Pcmax) where capillary equilibrium is possible and derive the necessary equations to obtain this maximum capillary pressure. We also discuss the implementation of the capillary equilibrium in a general purpose compositional reservoir simulator and the numerical challenges involved with its application to unconventional reservoirs. Three simulation case studies for gas condensate and tight oil reservoirs were performed to illustrate the influence of capillary pressure on production behavior. These results clarify the influence of capillary pressure on production behavior in low-permeability reservoirs. We show that the choice of the capillary pressure function and parameters significantly affects the results.","http://onepetro.org/SPEATCE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/175135-MS/2344710/spe-175135-ms.pdf",""

These similar spectral power distributions were also observed in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals obtained from six representative regions of interest (ROIs). After applying brain global, white-matter, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) mean signal regressions and low-pass filtering (< 0.08 Hz), the spectral power of BOLD signal was reduced by 55.6% to 64.9% in all ROIs ( P = 0.011 to 0.001).

Their critical role in replication of cytoplasmic viruses has just begun to be understood. Poxviruses, a family of large cytoplasmic DNA viruses, rely on the intracellular membranes to develop their envelope, and poxvirus morphogenesis requires enzymes from the cellular phosphoinositide metabolic pathway. However, the role of phosphoinositides in poxvirus replication remains unclear, and no poxvirus proteins show any homology to eukaryotic phosphoinositide binding domains. Recently, a group of poxvirus proteins, termed viral membrane assembly proteins (VMAPs), were identified as essential for poxvirus membrane biogenesis. A key component of VMAPs is the H7 protein. Here we report the crystal structure of the H7 protein from vaccinia virus. The H7 structure displays a novel fold comprised of seven α-helices and a highly curved three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet. We identified a phosphoinositide binding site in H7, comprised of basic residues on a surface patch and the flexible C-terminal tail. These residues were found to be essential for viral replication and for binding of H7 to phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P). Our studies suggest that phosphoinositide binding by H7 plays an essential role in poxvirus membrane biogenesis.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.03073-14",""

Client identification reflects the extent to which an auditor's self-concept and self-definition are derived from a perceived oneness with the client. In contrast, client commitment reflects a responsibility for and a dedication to the client, but the auditor and client remain separate psychological entities. Drawing from the unique perspectives of social identity theory and social exchange theory, we hypothesize and find that client identification is distinct from client commitment. Further, we hypothesize and find that client identification and client commitment have different effects on auditor objectivity. Specifically, client identification is negatively related to auditor objectivity, whereas client commitment is positively related. The findings of this study apply predominantly to the audit of private companies where clients are more likely to exert influence over auditors and auditors may be less likely to withstand client pressures.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-horizons/article-pdf/29/3/577/14952/acch-51091.pdf",""

Transient clouds are examples of mobile clouds, which are created on‐the‐fly by the devices present in an environment to share their physical resources (e.g. CPU, memory and network) and would disappear as the nodes leave the network. They enable a device to go beyond its own physical limitations through utilising the capabilities offered by nearby devices over an ad hoc network. This idea exploits the device‐to‐device (D2D) communications paradigm, which allows two nearby devices to communicate with each other in the licenced cellular bandwidth without a base station involved.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fett.3002",""

However, their relatively low stiffness prohibits the robots from machining of metallic materials accurately. Besides, the resulting vibration causes reduced tool life. One of the main problems with robot machining is chatter. Although many researchers have studied this problem for a while, they were not able to fully eliminate chatter due to the complexity of the problem which arises from many factors including cutting parameters, cutting tool and work-piece material. Several studies have been conducted to predict the occurrence of chatter. However, many of them lack the important element in predicting chatter: the element of uncertainty. It is important to consider uncertainty in predicting chatter since the parameters associated are inherently uncertain. This study implements probabilistic approach to predict chatter considering the uncertainty in machining parameters. The magnitude of cutting force is used to determine whether a chatter has occurred or not. The research question of this study is ‘Can a probabilistic analysis be used to predict chatter occurrence?’ To answer the research question, the following specific aims were developed: (1) develop a framework for predicting chatter occurrence, and (2) perform probabilistic analysis of chatter occurrence. The framework consists of a multibody modeling software (ADAMS), probabilistic analysis software (NESSUS) and MATLAB which is used as an interfacing platform. The probabilistic analysis implemented in the framework provides two important results. Firstly, it determines the probability of occurrence of chatter. Secondly, it provides sensitivity analysis that shows most important parameters which instigate chatter.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2015-53500/2492423/v02bt02a054-imece2015-53500.pdf",""

Using the application, a basic framework is tested based on the gender of participants. The results suggest that it is necessary to have adequate number of role models accessible to students as female role-models tend to select fewer students to develop relationships with a preference for female students.

While existing literature documents the challenges of ELL/non-ELL interaction and proposes strategies for overcoming them, there is little research examining concrete episodes of interaction from both the ELL and non-ELL perspectives. In response, I explore how a group of refugee and immigrant high school students (ELLs and non-ELLs) negotiated their interaction while collaboratively creating a digital video. In particular, I consider the role of the “language barrier” and how the participants interacted through and despite language. In the tradition of humanities-oriented educational research, I draw on Levinasian philosophy to reflect on the relational and ethical aspects of ELL/non-ELL interaction. Findings suggest that while language played a key role, communication obstacles tended to defy simple and strategic anticipation and resolution. Negotiation of meaning was often a creative, situated, and multidirectional process. Most importantly, interaction seemed to be ultimately about people in relationshipâ€”uncertain and at times uncomfortable, but also full of promise and opportunities for ethical response. I propose opening spaces as a new approach to ELL/non-ELL interaction that foregrounds human and ethical dimensions. Such reframing dislodges the issue from common assumptions which may unwittingly reduce ELLs to a “language problem,” and it honors the potential of participants creatively working out the interaction for themselves. By pursuing insights from both ELLs and non-ELLs, this study offers an important perspective rarely explored in the literature.","https://publicationsncte.org/content/journals/10.58680/rte201527349?crawler=true&mimetype=application/pdf",""

Not only do fictional media act as a plausibility structure that supports belief in criminal cults, but the reciprocal relationship between fictional stories and actual claims creates a hegemonic discourse in which claims about evil conspiracies and the religious other can be promoted surreptitiously.

Despite the devastating results of defeat, the French royal government began laying plans to challenge Britain’s global power. The French position in India, however, was quite weak. Pondichéry, the principal French establishment, had been destroyed during the war, and France had only a small armed force on the subcontinent after 1763. However, the colonial officials in India assured the ministry that many important Indian princes chafed under the tyrannical authority of the British East India Company and would eagerly join—and, some argued, even pay for—a French invasion force in order to weaken or destroy that power. The prospect of a colonial uprising in North America added to the French hopes of success. The governor, Jean Law de Lauriston, insisted that France increase its military force and rebuild the fortifications at Pondichéry to demonstrate French power to the Indian rulers. The ministry, however, did not bolster its military presence in India, preferring to believe that the princes would bear the brunt of the expenses and fighting in India while France devoted its resources to the North American conflict. In the end this vision of a restored French presence in India failed to materialise because the Indian rulers saw little evidence that France would undertake a meaningful attack against British authority in India.","https://academic.oup.com/ehr/article-pdf/130/544/583/51600091/ehr_130_544_583.pdf",""

Transgender individuals transgress the binary conception of gender by deviating from societal gender norms associated with assigned sex at birth. The Department of Defense has set policies and standards that reflect a binary conception of gender, with a focus on conformity. We argue that able-bodied gender variant service personnel are just as capable of serving their country as anyone else. Because of the repercussions associated with active duty transgender military personnel, our sample is small and involves nine clandestine service members and two international service members who wanted to share their stories from a different perspective. Snowball sampling was aimed at finding current active duty and reserve transgender service members. Using a combination of telephone interviews and questionnaires, data were collected from active duty transgender service personnel throughout the United States and two from international militaries that allow transgender people to serve. Data collection focused on the overall experiences of the participants along with questions regarding workplace discrimination, suggestions for policy changes, and their views about the overturn of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell. Our findings add to a growing source of information about the transgender military experience in the U.S. armed forces and the importance of overturning discriminatory workplace policies that negatively impact transgender service members.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2158244015584231",""

While existing literature documents the challenges of ELL/non-ELL interaction and proposes strategies for overcoming them, there is little research examining concrete episodes of interaction from both the ELL and non-ELL perspectives. In response, I explore how a group of refugee and immigrant high school students (ELLs and non-ELLs) negotiated their interaction while collaboratively creating a digital video. In particular, I consider the role of the “language barrier” and how the participants interacted through and despite language. In the tradition of humanities-oriented educational research, I draw on Levinasian philosophy to reflect on the relational and ethical aspects of ELL/non-ELL interaction. Findings suggest that while language played a key role, communication obstacles tended to defy simple and strategic anticipation and resolution. Negotiation of meaning was often a creative, situated, and multidirectional process. Most importantly, interaction seemed to be ultimately about people in relationshipâ€”uncertain and at times uncomfortable, but also full of promise and opportunities for ethical response. I propose opening spaces as a new approach to ELL/non-ELL interaction that foregrounds human and ethical dimensions. Such reframing dislodges the issue from common assumptions which may unwittingly reduce ELLs to a “language problem,” and it honors the potential of participants creatively working out the interaction for themselves. By pursuing insights from both ELLs and non-ELLs, this study offers an important perspective rarely explored in the literature.","https://publicationsncte.org/content/journals/10.58680/rte201527349?crawler=true&mimetype=application/pdf",""

However, adults over 65 are at a higher risk, with one-third falling each year. Transitioning between level and hill surfaces poses a greater fall risk than walking on either surface alone. Previous studies found that young adults adopted a cautious gait pattern to mitigate this risk. As older adults typically employ a cautious pattern during level walking, we investigated how they modify their gait pattern to safely transition between surfaces. Twenty adults over the age of 65 transitioned onto and off of a 15° ramp while we recorded kinematics and muscle activity. During the level-to-downhill and uphill-to-level transitions, participants took slower, shorter steps indicative of an exaggerated cautious gait pattern. The older adults also exhibited greater muscle activity during the transitions, which may be due to muscle weakness requiring compensatory strategies to meet the greater demands of the task. However, the slower, shorter steps when transitioning from uphill to level suggest that these compensations may not always be adequate. Thus, it is important to consider the relationship between physical abilities and task demands in evaluating walking terrains that may be excessively difficult or dangerous for older adults.","https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/jab/31/3/article-p133.xml",""

One way to improve the management of a field involves adjusting the production flow rates over a short time, maximizing the overall NPV during the life cycle of the field. Using intelligent wells (IW), the challenges include not only the optimization of well flow rates, but also the simultaneous adjustment of flow in each valve, controlling each aperture in a given production time. These optimal control strategies are often difficult to be realized in practice due to the large number of control variables involved in the optimization process, especially with larger number of wells and valves. To this end, this work proposes an efficient optimization framework employing a fast genetic algorithm (FGA) in order to adjust simultaneously the flow rates of wells and the valves aperture. We have used a commercial reservoir simulator whereby the flow rates of wells were optimized with an option available that calculates well rates when there is production constraint on the wells (platform capacity or other operational constraint) using production parameters in real time; and at the same time the flow in each valve was controlled through a keyword associated with the control of the aperture of valves by monitoring the pressure drop around of them. The FGA optimization algorithm employed is a global optimization method, which is robust and efficient for sweeping the solution space with many variables, and it is able to work with continuous and discrete variables simultaneously. We demonstrate the power of the FGA strategy by applying the methodology to a heterogeneous reservoir model based on Brazil's Namorado field, with four horizontal producers and four horizontal injector wells. Two producers were tested as intelligent, using two valves of continuous variation type. The rate of wells was determined using water cut values while there were constraints on the production of the platform. The valves were adjusted each 60 days, during the first four years of production, closing in the optimal time at the end of production. The results showed an improvement in reservoir management, increasing 3.7% of NPV, with additional gains around US$ 20 million (already discounted the costs of intelligent completion), increasing oil production and reducing water production. The combination of the tools available in a commercial simulator jointly with global optimization algorithm showed advantages of the operation of the wells and valves simultaneously.","http://onepetro.org/SPELACP/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/177255-MS/1459947/spe-177255-ms.pdf",""

During BFR training, blood flow to the exercising muscle is mechanically restricted by placing flexible pressurizing cuffs around the active limb proximal to the working muscle. This maneuver results in the accumulation of metabolites (e.g., protons and lactic acid) in the muscle interstitium that increase muscle force and promote muscle growth. Therefore, the premise of BFR training is to simulate and receive the benefits of high-intensity resistance exercise while merely performing low-intensity resistance exercise. This technique has also been purported to provide health benefits to the elderly, individuals recovering from joint injuries, and patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation. Since the seminal work of Alam and Smirk in the 1930s, it has been well established that reductions in blood flow to exercising muscle engage the exercise pressor reflex (EPR), a reflex that significantly contributes to the autonomic cardiovascular response to exercise. However, the EPR and its likely contribution to the BFR-mediated cardiovascular response to exercise is glaringly missing from the scientific literature. Inasmuch as the EPR has been shown to generate exaggerated increases in sympathetic nerve activity in disease states such as hypertension (HTN), heart failure (HF), and peripheral artery disease (PAD), concerns are raised that BFR training can be used safely for the rehabilitation of patients with cardiovascular disease, as has been suggested. Abnormal BFR-induced and EPR-mediated cardiovascular complications generated during exercise could precipitate adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (e.g., cardiac arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, stroke and sudden cardiac death). Moreover, although altered EPR function in HTN, HF, and PAD underlies our concern for the widespread implementation of BFR, use of this training mechanism may also have negative consequences in the absence of disease. That is, even normal, healthy individuals performing resistance training exercise with BFR are potentially at increased risk for deleterious cardiovascular events. This review provides a brief yet detailed overview of the mechanisms underlying the autonomic cardiovascular response to exercise with BFR. A more complete understanding of the consequences of BFR training is needed before this technique is passively explored by the layman athlete or prescribed by a health care professional.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpheart.00208.2015",""

In addition to inelastic deformations, this model incorporates rock anisotropies. Fracture mechanics of microcrack and micro-void nucleation and their coalescence are incorporated into the formulation of the CZM models to accurately capture different failure modes of rocks. The performance of the developed elastoplastic and CZM models are compared with the available data of a shale play, and then the models are introduced into a commercial finite element package through user-defined subroutines. A workflow to derive the required model parameters for both intact rock and cemented natural fractures is presented through inverse modeling of field data. The hydraulic fractures' growth in the reservoir scale is then simulated, in which the effect of fluid viscosity, natural fracture characteristics and differential stresses on induced fracture network is studied. The simulation results are compared with the available solutions in the literature. The developed CZM model outperforms the traditional fracture mechanics approaches by removing stress singularities at the fracture tips, and simulation of progressive fractures without any essential need for remeshing. This model would provide a robust tool for modeling hydraulic fracture growth using conventional elements of FEA.","http://onepetro.org/SPEHFTC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/SPE-173384-MS/1405501/spe-173384-ms.pdf",""

The authors first assessed the toxicity of different dosing vehicles: 100 μL of water, propylene glycol, and acetone were not toxic. The authors then assessed the oral and dermal toxicity of 4 pesticides following the up‐and‐down procedure. Neither brodifacoum nor chlorothalonil caused mortality at doses ≤ 1750 μg/g. Under the “neat pesticide” oral exposure, endosulfan (median lethal dose [LD50] = 9.8 μg/g) was more toxic than λ‐cyhalothrin (LD50 = 916.5 μg/g). Neither chemical was toxic via dermal exposure. An acetone dosing vehicle increased λ‐cyhalothrin toxicity (oral LD50 = 9.8 μg/g; dermal LD50 = 17.5 μg/g), but not endosulfan. Finally, changes in dosing method and husbandry significantly increased dermal λ‐cyhalothrin LD50s, which highlights the importance of standardized methods. The authors combined data from the present study with other reptile LD50s to correlate with available avian data. When only definitive LD50s were used in the analysis, a strong correlation was found between avian and reptile toxicity. The results suggest it is possible to build predictive relationships between avian and reptile LD50s.

Considering the high cost and health-related/environment-related issues associated with the production of fumed silica, the route to synthesise high-quality pigments using RH biowaste satisfies the sustainable development, economy and environmental demands. Furthermore, a large number of pigments with various colours were prepared through adjusting the formulation of the raw materials. A predictive model for the colours of the ceramic pigments as a function of pigment chemical composition was developed, which provides a quick colour prediction of the synthesized pigments based on their chemical composition.

Toward this end, we develop a novel, predictive analytics model, termed as the beta geometric Erlang-2 (BG/EG) hurdle model, which predicts the propensity, frequency, and timing of readmissions of patients diagnosed with congestive heart failure (CHF). This unified model enables us to answer three key questions related to the use of predictive analytics methods for patient readmissions: whether a readmission will occur, how often readmissions will occur, and when a readmission will occur. We test our model using a unique data set that tracks patient demographic, clinical, and administrative data across 67 hospitals in North Texas over a four-year period. We show that our model provides superior predictive performance compared to extant models such as the logit, BG/NBD hurdle, and EG hurdle models. Our model also allows us to study the association between hospital usage of health information technologies (IT) and readmission risk. We find that health IT usage, patient demographics, visit characteristics, payer type, and hospital characteristics, are significantly associated with patient readmission risk. We also observe that implementation of cardiology information systems is associated with a reduction in the propensity and frequency of future readmissions, whereas administrative IT systems are correlated with a lower frequency of future readmissions. Our results indicate that patient profiles derived from our model can serve as building blocks for a predictive analytics system to identify CHF patients with high readmission risk.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/isre.2014.0553",""

Methods: We studied 38,009 mothers who participated in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study and delivered between 1997 and 2009. We assessed odds ratios [ORs] for the association between maternal occupations with potential exposure to IR and 39 birth defects. Results: We observed significant odds ratios (ORs) for isolated hydrocephaly (adjusted OR [AOR], 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1–4.2), isolated anotia/microtia (AOR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.0–4.0), isolated colonic atresia (crude OR, 7.5; 95% CI, 2.5–22.3), isolated omphalocele (AOR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1–4.6) and isolated anencephaly (crude OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.06–0.94). We also observed a nonsignificant OR for birth defects in aggregate (AOR, 2.0; 95% CI, 0.9–4.6) among mothers with potential occupational exposure to fluoroscopy. Conclusion: We assessed 39 birth defects, observing that maternal occupations with potential exposure to IR were associated with a significantly increased risk for 4 birth defects and a significantly protected risk for 1 birth defect. These results should be interpreted cautiously because our measurement of exposure is qualitative, some of these associations may be due to occupational exposures that are correlated with IR and some may be due to chance. However, these findings serve as the first evaluation of these relationships in a large study and may be useful for generating hypotheses for future studies.

Nonetheless, the invasive species was more sensitive to both drought and fire, possibly due to higher heat exposure of growing points. Thus, burning during the summer of a drought year may constitute the sought‐after treatment that selectively favours native species. Ultimately, successful management will involve fuel and temperature management combined with assessment of the relative phenologies of the target species prior to burning.

Such an adaptive filter with low side-lobe response gives rise to a high-resolution fitness function, with clear and narrow ridges, which significantly facilitates identification of different modes. At each frequency, for a data set with a moderate noise level, slowness of all modes hidden in the recorded waveforms can be identified without prior knowledge of the exact number of wave modes.

The interface trap density (Dit) is estimated to be as low as ∼2 × 1012 cm−2 eV−1 under the current growth and anneal conditions. Some interfacial reaction is observed between SHO and Ge at temperatures above ∼650 °C, which may contribute to increased Dit value. This study confirms the potential for crystalline oxides grown directly on Ge by atomic layer deposition for advanced electronic applications.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.4906953/15154015/054101_1_online.pdf",""

For example, prior to and during the selection of a gift, the giver endures positive and negative emotions, as he/she grapples with selecting the perfect gift, and ponders if the recipient will actually cherish the purchased item. During this dynamic exchange process, emotional recognition, management of emotions, emotional empathy, and anticipated elation are oft experienced by both the giver and recipient. However, research examining such emotions quantitatively in a gifting context is scant and models of these faculties in the gift‐giving milieu are nonexistent. To help fill this research fissure, four studies are developed; they, in general, investigate determinants of feelings linked with the gestation, prestation, and reformulation stages of the gift‐giving event. Specifically, Study 1 (giver's perspective) and Study 2 (receiver's perspective) reveal a mediation void in the models tested. Heeding these results, Study 3 (gift given) and Study 4 (gift received) introduce anticipated elation as a key factor between the aforementioned emotive factors and the emotional responses inherent in the gift‐giving stages, among others. Managerial implications and future research directions are offered.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fmar.20773",""

All of the simulated supercells increase the low-level shear in their proximal environment; however, this effect is more pronounced when cloud shading is included. Shading stabilizes the boundary layer beneath the cirrus anvil, diminishes boundary layer rolls and their attendant thermodynamic perturbations, and reduces the intensity of resolved turbulent mixing in the convective boundary layer. Anvil shading also acts to reduce the buoyancy of inflow air and the horizontal buoyancy gradient along the forward-flank outflow boundary.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/mwr/article-pdf/144/1/273/4354952/mwr-d-15-0247_1.pdf",""

The growth in wind farm installations in the past 10 years has led to an increase in the number of wind turbines reaching the end of their manufacturing warranties. As a consequence, the wind industry is now facing a rising cost of unscheduled maintenance, which is pushing up the operation and maintenance expenditures. Wind turbines experience stochastic loading due to seasonal variations in wind speed and direction. These harsh operational conditions lead to failures of wind turbine components, which are difficult to predict. Consequently, it is challenging to schedule maintenance actions that will avoid failures. In this paper, we derive algorithms for scheduling wind farm maintenance for wind turbines modeled explicitly as comprising multiple components: the gearbox, power generator, blades and control system. We perform simulations based on a real wind farm with 100 turbines and report on several wind farm performance measures. The results we obtain provide insights regarding how to efficiently manage limited maintenance resources in wind farms. For example, the results show that maintenance policies that consider performing maintenance on multiple components of a wind turbine on the same maintenance scheduled trip provides significant cost savings while reducing the number of turbine failures.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0037549715572490",""

Specifically, responses to whether one favors or opposes laws prohibiting marriages between Blacks and Whites are combined with a measure of social distance (whether one had a member of the opposite race over for dinner in the past year) to produce a hierarchy of responses that include both attitudes and corresponding behaviors, and in essence reflect varying degrees of racial prejudice. These attitudes and behaviors are analyzed using ordinal logistic regression from 1973 through 1996. Through the application of race relations and differential assimilation theories, the impact of racial group membership, age, and socio-economic status on interracial marriage attitudes and behaviors in contemporary American society is assessed. Our findings suggest that while there have been some dramatic shifts in racially patterned attitudes and behaviors across all groups, barriers to assimilation persist, and non-Blacks engage in a greater degree of social closure.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0021934714568017",""

One of the largest intraplate volcanic events occurred during the mid‐Cretaceous, roughly 75–125 Ma in the western Pacific. To investigate the origin of this volcanism we present the first comprehensive study of volcanism in the Pigafetta Basin using seismic surveys, magnetic and gravity modeling, and Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) drill core and well log data from Site 801. Our results show that intraplate volcanism in the Pigafetta Basin coincides with the rest of the western Pacific seamount provinces, supporting the previously suggested plumelets scenario for the origin of intraplate volcanism during the mid‐Cretaceous volcanic events. Our magnetic modeling suggests that the late‐stage volcanism does not overprint the remanant magnetization acquired by the Jurassic ocean crust in the Pigafetta Basin, and hence, marine magnetic anomalies recorded in the Jurassic basement are preserved. Also, the formerly identified Rough‐Smooth Boundary (RSB) is indistinguishable from any other rough‐smooth topographic boundaries throughout the survey area suggesting that the RSB is unlikely to be a Cretaceous sill‐Jurassic basement boundary. Lastly, the apparent ages and spatial distribution of volcanic features suggests a dynamic history of hydrothermal circulation in the Pigafetta Basin, indicating that hydrothermal circulation was ongoing well past 100 Ma.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2F2015GC005873",""

We studied the effects of poultry dust extract on molecular regulation of interleukin-8 (IL-8), a proinflammatory cytokine, in A549 and Beas2B lung epithelial and THP-1 monocytic cells. Our findings indicate that poultry dust extract potently induces IL-8 levels by increasing IL-8 gene transcription without altering IL-8 mRNA stability. Increase in IL-8 promoter activity was due to enhanced binding of activator protein 1 and NF-κB. IL-8 induction was associated with protein kinase C (PKC) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation and inhibited by PKC and MAPK inhibitors. IL-8 increase was not inhibited by polymyxin B or l-nitroarginine methyl ester, indicating lack of involvement of lipopolysaccharide and nitric oxide in the induction. Lung epithelial and THP-1 cells share common mechanisms for induction of IL-8 levels. Our findings identify key roles for transcriptional mechanisms and protein kinase signaling pathways for IL-8 induction and provide insights into the mechanisms regulating lung inflammatory responses to organic dust exposure.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajplung.00215.2014",""

Nevertheless, several U.S. state legislatures recently passed or proposed laws to scale back their EIP voting operations. Such efforts have met with opposition, as both academic researchers and federal courts have found that minority voters, especially African Americans, now utilize EIP voting at significantly higher rates than White voters. Prior to the 2012 presidential election, this argument was central to a federal court’s decision to temporarily block legislation in Ohio that sought to cut several days from the state’s EIP voting period. A post-election legal battle is reconsidering this matter, and the outcome will shape Ohio’s voting rules going forward. This article contributes empirical results to the discourse by estimating EIP voting take-up rates, by race, during the 2008 and 2012 U.S. presidential elections in Ohio’s three largest counties. Ecological inference models reveal that African Americans in all three study areas voted EIP at substantially higher rates than White voters during both elections. These results are supported by decile tables that report early voting behavior for relatively racially homogeneous geographies, and by geovisualizations that depict direct relationships between the spatial distributions of minority persons and EIP voting usage. Collectively, the findings suggest that the potential effects of Ohio’s proposed policy changes would not be equally distributed between racial groups.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2158244015591825",""

Small-polaron hopping is further evidenced by the measured Hall mobility in the ab-plane (10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 300 K) being larger and much less strongly activated than the deduced drift mobility (about 5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 300 K).

The implications of this proposition contradict classic models of voting behavior, which state that voting costs and electoral participation are inversely related. The present article/research note explores this tension in the context of some fundamental economic concepts. Namely, after identifying characteristics of a voting “market” that might facilitate the outcome in question, a simple model of that market is developed and used to simulate changes in turnout due to changes in voter ID rules for a hypothetical polity. Counter to proponents’ claims, the findings suggest that voter ID laws tend to decrease turnout, even when most voters place positive value on stricter (i.e., fraud preventing) voting regulations. That being said, the model is intentionally simplistic, and it is put forward primarily as a tool for thinking critically about the relationship between voter ID laws and electoral participation. Because data that are suited to empirical analyses of this relationship are lacking, complementary techniques, such as modeling and simulation, are useful for testing unverified hypotheses about voter ID rules from the political discourse. The simple exercises in this research note begin to fill this gap, though they function most readily as points of departure for future research.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2158244015580379",""

This article illustrates this enduring reality within immigration policies and practices utilizing the color-blind perspective. We begin by summarizing the key tenets of Bonilla-Silva’s color-blind racism. We then overview immigration policies and practices in effect during the era of explicit racialization. Next, we contrast policies and practices with the more subtle employment of racialization today. The bulk of our article is devoted to illustrating how the racialized impact of immigration policies and procedures serves as a mechanism for the reproduction of color blindness and a racially unequal social order. We conclude with a discussion on the difficulties of grappling with this reality in a racially stratified society that is reluctant to acknowledge it.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0002764214566502",""

While labs are active by nature, traditional undergraduate science laboratories are expository, requiring students to follow steps in a procedure to attain a predetermined result (i.e., “cookbook labs”). While it is well‐established that active learning has a higher educational value than passive learning, the physical act of doing a lab activity is not enough to enable students to understand concepts, make connections, and retain complex material in the long‐term. The purpose of our study was to identify ways to increase the educational value of our histotechnology and parasitology laboratories without drastically restructuring the curriculum. We used a two‐group, pre‐ and post‐quiz experimental design. In our experimental group, we incorporated three common learning activities (strip‐sequence activity, concept mapping, and clickers) into labs that had long waiting times in between procedural steps. We hypothesized that incorporating these activities would give students an opportunity to recall and internalize the conceptual information and that this would lead to a deeper understanding of the procedures, long‐term retention of the material, and the ability to think about the lab procedure at higher order levels of thinking. Preliminary results show that this is a promising strategy for lab instruction, with quiz scores in the experimental group improving for two out of the three lab activities.

The basic vorticity evolution in these idealized simulations is consistent with previous work: the process is primarily baroclinic and produces near-ground vertical vorticity within the outflow. Sensitivity experiments affirm that the only fundamental requirement for downdrafts to produce surface vertical vorticity is the existence of ambient downdraft-relative flow. Vertical vorticity production increases monotonically as the low-level downdraft-relative flow increases from zero up through intermediate values (in these experiments, 10–15 m s−1), followed by a monotonic decrease for greater values. This sensitivity has to do with the degree of cooling acquired by parcels as they pass through the idealized heat sink as well as the degree to which horizontal vorticity vectors subsequently attain an orientation that is normal to isosurfaces of vertical velocity. Although the addition of vertical wind shear is not directly helpful to surface vertical vorticity production in these simulations, increased realism of outflow structure is attained in hodographs with ambient streamwise vorticity. Furthermore, the necessary condition of flow through a region of downdraft forcing would in nature probably require the existence of ambient vertical shear. Therefore, shear in the lower troposphere has a possibly important indirect role in modulating the initial production of near-ground rotation.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/mwr/article-pdf/143/7/2795/4345586/mwr-d-14-00310_1.pdf",""

To this end, we develop a rigorous quantitative framework to analyze and compare several patching policies that are of practical interest. Our analyses of pure policies—policies that rely on a single metric such as elapsed time or patch severity level—show that certain policies are never optimal and no single policy may fit all information systems uniformly well. Depending on the context parameters, particularly the setup and business disruption costs for patching, either a time-based approach or an approach based on the cumulative severity level may be effective. To develop a more complete guideline for policy selection, we decipher hybrid policies that combine multiple metrics. Finally, we conduct extensive numerical experiments to verify the robustness of our analytical results.

More importantly, we find dividends have an interactive effect with respect to earnings persistence and earnings manipulation: the negative association between audit fees and earnings persistence is more pronounced for dividend firms; and dividend payouts mitigate the positive relation between earnings manipulation risk and audit fees. Our results imply dividends reduce audit risk by enhancing clients' earnings quality information.

On day 15, maturity was assessed and morphometric characteristics, including mass, total body length, tail length and width, length of the third swimming appendage and eye diameter, were measured.

A. franciscana were generally larger following exposure to 10 and 40 ppt during day 1-6 and 7-9 when compared to day 10-12 and 13-15, in part due to a higher percentage of mature individuals. Exposure to different salinities on day 1-6 produced the greatest differences in morphometry, and thus day 1-6 appears to be a period in development when A. franciscana is particularly sensitive to salinity. Viewing the developmental window as three-dimensional allowed more effective visualization of the complex interactions between exposure window, stressor dose and the magnitude of morphometric changes in A. franciscana.","http://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article-pdf/219/4/571/1917053/jeb125823.pdf",""

However, multiple statistical tests were conducted and it was unclear which of these associations would be replicated in a larger study. We used a large database to assess the association between maternal parity and 65 birth defects including birth defects that have not been previously studied. METHODS: Using data from the Texas Birth Defects Registry for years 1999–2009, the risk of a birth defect occurring in a first, third, or fourth or higher birth was compared to the risk of a birth defect occurring in a second birth. RESULTS: Women having their first birth had significantly increased odds of having an infant with 24 of 65 categories of birth defects when compared to women having their second birth. We also observed associations between first birth and an increased risk of five birth defects not previously reported (small penis, preaxial polydactyly, anomalies of the thoracic vertebrae, anomalies of the lumbar vertebrae, and sacroccygeal anomalies). Women having their third or fourth or higher birth had significantly increased odds of giving birth to infants with five of 65 birth defects when compared to second births. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations regarding the categories of birth defects that were associated with first births were highly consistent with observations from two previous studies. Research into biological, behavioral, and environmental factors that may increase the risk of specific birth defects among first births is needed to further explore these associations.

The underlying causes of these production constraints are not well understood. The rate‐limiting step in gas production is likely diffusive transport from matrix storage to the stimulated fracture network. Transport through a porous material such as shale is controlled by both geometry (e.g., pore size distribution) and topology (e.g., pore connectivity). Through an integrated experimental and theoretical approach, this work finds that the Barnett Formation has sparsely connected pores. Evidence of low pore connectivity includes the sparse and heterogeneous presence of trace levels of diffusing solutes beyond a few millimeters from a sample edge, the anomalous behavior of spontaneous water imbibition, the steep decline in edge‐accessible porosity observed in tracer concentrations following vacuum saturation, the low (about 0.2–0.4% by volume) level presence of Wood's metal alloy when injected at 600 MPa pressure, and high tortuosity from mercury injection capillary pressure. Results are consistent with an interpretation of pore connectivity based on percolation theory. Low pore connectivity of shale matrix limits its mass transfer interaction with the stimulated fracture network from hydraulic fracturing and serves as an important underlying cause for steep declines in gas production rates and a low overall recovery rate.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2F2015JB012103",""

We propose a Bayesian dynamic model for the joint effects of dose and schedule. The model proposed allows us to borrow strength across dose–schedule combinations without making overly restrictive assumptions on the ordering pattern of the schedule effects. We develop a dose–schedule finding algorithm to allocate patients sequentially to a desirable dose–schedule combination, and to select an optimal combination at the end of the trial. We apply the proposed design to a phase I–II clinical trial of a γ-secretase inhibitor in patients with refractory metastatic or locally advanced solid tumours, and we examine the operating characteristics of the design through simulations.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Frssc.12113",""

A preliminary extrusion process is required to produce thermoplastic filaments for use in FDM 3D printers. It is crucial that extruded filament must have constant dimensional accuracy for FDM 3D printers to produce the desired object with precision. In this study, carbon fibers were blended with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) thermoplastics to produce carbon fiber reinforced ABS filaments in order to improve the mechanical properties of FDM-printed objects. During filament extrusion, three process variables showed significant effects on filament diameter, expansion percentage, and extrusion rate. These process variables included carbon fiber content, extrusion temperature, and nozzle size. The objective of this study is to test the feasible ranges of these process variables and to investigate their effects on filament extrusion.

Prior studies have found that managers who form close interpersonal relationships with clients can stabilize market ties, but these relationships can also be a source of increased market tie dissolution in the event of an exchange manager’s departure from the firm. Using data on all state-level lobbyists and clients in the Texas lobbying industry from 2001 to 2009, we confirm that a client is more likely to remain with a firm than to follow a departing manager to a new firm, but the depth, focus, and shared ownership of a manager’s client relationship moderate the impact of his or her mobility on market tie dissolution. We find that the tenure of the relationship with a manager, the number of clients on a manager’s roster, the level of attention received from a manager, and the presence of an additional manager relationship at the same firm all influence where a client places its business when a manager departs. Our results suggest that embeddedness explanations strongly predict interpersonal market tie dissolution when managers are stationary but lose their predictive power when managers move to new firms. We propose that an alternative logic of interorganizational market ties, based on power and resource dependence, may be at play in such situations.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0001839215619198",""

The first gltA mutation, which increases CS activity by disrupting NADH-inhibition of this enzyme, is beneficial for growth on the acetate and contributed to preserving the rudimentary Cit+ trait from extinction when it first evolved. However, after Cit+ was refined by further mutations, this potentiating gltA mutation became deleterious to fitness. A second wave of beneficial gltA mutations then evolved that reduced CS activity to below the ancestral level.

Generally, the C-band radars located in the near-equatorial Indian Ocean—Shared Mobile Atmospheric Research and Teaching Radar (SMART-R) on Addu Atoll (Gan) and NASA TOGA on the R/V Roger Revelle (Revelle)—observed similar trends in echo-top heights, stratiform rain fraction, and precipitation feature size across the MJO life cycle. These trends are closely related to changes in mid- to upper-tropospheric moisture, sea surface temperature (SST), zonal wind, and diagnosed vertical air motions. However, the evolution of convection, moisture, and vertical air motion at the R/V Mirai (Mirai), located in the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) at 8°S, exhibited a pattern nearly opposite to Gan and Revelle. When the MJO was active over the equator, convection was suppressed around Mirai owing to induced subsidence by the strong upward motion to the north. SST and zonal winds near Mirai were nearly invariant across the MJO life cycle, indicating little influence from the MJO in these fields. Compared to Gan and Revelle, Mirai had a significant amount of precipitation that fell from shallow and isolated convection. There were subtle differences in the evolution and properties of the convection observed between Gan and Revelle. Deep convection occurred slightly earlier at Gan compared to Revelle, consistent with the west-to-east progression of the MJO in the central Indian Ocean. Furthermore, convective deepening was more gradual over Revelle compared to Gan, especially during the October MJO event.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jas/article-pdf/72/11/4126/3651937/jas-d-15-0032_1.pdf",""

Because maternal employment during the first year of the child's life has been identified as a reason for breastfeeding cessation, we develop and test a role‐theory‐based framework to explain women's continuation of breastfeeding after return to work (Study 1) and report results of an exploratory study linking breastfeeding at work with job attitudes and well‐being (Study 2). Applying survival analysis to a longitudinal dataset gathered by the Centers for Disease Control (Study 1), we identify pregnant women's perceived employer support for breastfeeding as a predictor of women's breastfeeding goal intentions. Supervisors' negative workplace remarks about breastfeeding related to an eightfold increase of women's likelihood to discontinue exclusive breastfeeding and perceived support for breastfeeding after return to work predicted exclusive breastfeeding continuation. Results of Study 2 suggest that women who return to work and continue breastfeeding experience more family‐to‐work conflict and overload than women who do not reconcile work and breastfeeding. Further, results of Study 2 provide preliminary evidence suggesting that perceptions of supervisor and coworker support for breastfeeding relate positively to general perceptions of organizational support and negatively to depressive symptoms.

Suggested risk factors for gastroschisis include maternal age, race/ethnicity, nativity, body mass index, and socioeconomic status. Methods: Data for cases of gastroschisis and live births were taken from the Texas Birth Defects Registry and Texas vital records for deliveries between 1999 and 2011. Prevalence by subgroups over time was calculated for: infant sex, maternal age, race/ethnicity, nativity, education, parity, plurality, body mass index, and payer type. Stratified, adjusted, and interaction analyses of the trends were conducted using Poisson regression. A joinpoint trend analysis was also conducted for each subgroup. Results: A total of 2,549 gastroschisis cases and 4,970,979 live births were delivered in 1999 to 2011, for an overall prevalence of 5.13 cases per 10,000 live births (95% confidence interval = 4.93–5.33).

However, because climate changes over the coming century will largely be driven by changes in greenhouse gases alone, it is important to better understand the separate contributions of each of these forcings in the past. To investigate this, idealized equilibrium simulations are conducted in which the climate is driven by separate changes in obliquity, precession, CO2, and ice sheets. To test the linearity of past climate change, anomalies from these single-forcing experiments are scaled and summed to compute linear reconstructions of past climate, which are then compared to mid-Holocene and last glacial maximum (LGM) snapshot simulations, where all forcings are applied together, as well as proxy climate records. This comparison shows that much of the climate response may be approximated as a linear response to forcings, while some features, such as modeled changes in sea ice and Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), appear to be heavily influenced by nonlinearities. In regions where the linear reconstructions replicate the full-forcing experiments well, this analysis can help identify how each forcing contributes to the climate response. Monsoons at the mid-Holocene respond strongly to precession, while LGM monsoons are heavily influenced by the altered greenhouse gases and ice sheets. Contrary to previous studies, ice sheets produce pronounced tropical cooling at the LGM. Compared to proxy temperature records, the linear reconstructions replicate long-term changes well and also show which climate variations are not easily explained as direct responses to long-term forcings.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jcli/article-pdf/28/24/9746/4057314/jcli-d-15-0329_1.pdf",""

In addition, multilevel homology tests demonstrated that workgroup-level personality–climate associations were more than 2½ times stronger than corresponding individual-level associations, supporting a proportional theory of homology.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1059601115576597",""

Despite the extensive application of various standards and codes, the control of loudness has not been a common target in past whole-house ventilation standards and codes. In order to evaluate the appropriate loudness of ventilation fans, especially in terms of leading standards and codes, a statistical analysis is necessary. Therefore, this paper provides statistical data for bathroom and utility ventilation fans over a nine year period from 2005 to 2013. Specifically, this paper presents an evaluation of changes in fan loudness over the 9 year test period and the relevance of loudness to leading standards including HVI and ASHRAE. The loudness levels of brushless DC-motor fans are also evaluated in comparison to the loudness of AC-motor fans. For AC and DC motor fans, relationships between loudness and efficacy was determined and then explained with regression models. Based on observations, this paper introduces a new “loudness-to-energy ratio” coefficient, L/E, which is a measure of the acoustic and energy performance of a fan. Relationships between acoustic and energy performances are established by using L/E coefficients with supporting statistics for bathroom and utility fans.","https://pubs.aip.org/jasa/article/137/4_Supplement/2401/711439/An-analysis-of-multi-year-acoustic-and-energy",""

In other words, humans use multiple signaling channels concurrently when communicating with one another. For example, people frequently produce manual gestures while speaking, and the words a person perceives are impacted by visual information. For this study, we hypothesized that similar to the way that humans regularly couple their spoken utterances with gestures and facial expressions, chimpanzees regularly produce vocalizations in conjunction with other communicative signals. To test this hypothesis, data were collected from 101 captive chimpanzees living in mixed‐sex social groupings of seven to twelve individuals. A total of 2,869 vocal events were collected. The data indicate that approximately 50% of the vocal events were produced in conjunction with another communicative modality. In addition, approximately 68% were directed to a specific individual, and these directed vocalizations were more likely to include a signal from another communicative modality than were vocalizations that were not directed to a specific individual. These results suggest that, like humans, chimpanzees often pair their vocalizations with signals from other communicative modalities. In addition, chimpanzees appear to use their communicative signals strategically to meet specific socio‐communicative ends, providing support for the growing literature that indicates that at least some chimpanzee vocal signaling is intentional.

This study examines the presence of depressive symptoms and the demographic and clinical correlates in a diverse sample of substance abuse treatment seekers to better characterize patients with co-occurring depressive symptoms and substance use disorders and understand potential treatment needs. Methods: Baseline data from a randomized clinical effectiveness trial of a computer-assisted, Web-delivered psychosocial intervention were analyzed. Participants ( N = 507) were recruited from 10 geographically diverse outpatient drug treatment programs. Assessments included the self-report Patient Health Questionnaire, and measures of coping strategies, social functioning, physical health status, and substance use. Results: One fifth (21%; n = 106) of the sample screened positive for depression; those screening positive for depression were significantly more likely to screen positive for anxiety (66.9%) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; 42.9%). After controlling for anxiety and PTSD symptoms, presence of depressive symptoms remained significantly associated with fewer coping strategies ( P = .001), greater impairment in social adjustment ( P < .001), and poorer health status ( P < .001), but not to days of drug use in the last 90 days ( P = .14). Conclusions: Depression is a clinically significant problem among substance abusers, and, in this study, patients who screened positive for depression were more likely to have co-occurring symptoms of anxiety and PTSD. Additionally, the presence of depressive symptoms was associated with fewer coping strategies and poorer social adjustment. Coping skills are a significant predictor of addiction outcomes, and it may be especially important to screen for and enhance coping among depressed patients. Evidence-based interventions that target coping skills and global functioning among substance abusers with depressive symptoms may be important adjuncts to usual treatment.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/08897077.2014.937845",""

However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. We hypothesized that fish oil with butyrate, a pectin fermentation product, protects against colon cancer initiation by decreasing cell proliferation and increasing differentiation and apoptosis through a p27Kip1-mediated mechanism. Rats were provided diets of corn or fish oil, with/without butyrate, and terminated 12, 24, or 48 hours after azoxymethane (AOM) injection. Proliferation (Ki-67), differentiation (Dolichos Biflorus Agglutinin), apoptosis (TUNEL), and p27Kip1 (cell-cycle mediator) were measured in the same cell within crypts in order to examine the coordination of cell cycle as a function of diet. DNA damage (N7-methylguanine) was determined by quantitative IHC analysis. Dietary fish oil decreased DNA damage by 19% (P = 0.001) and proliferation by 50% (P = 0.003) and increased differentiation by 56% (P = 0.039) compared with corn oil. When combined with butyrate, fish oil enhanced apoptosis 24 hours after AOM injection compared with a corn oil/butyrate diet (P = 0.039). There was an inverse relationship between crypt height and apoptosis in the fish oil/butyrate group (r = −0.53, P = 0.040). The corn oil/butyrate group showed a positive correlation between p27Kip1 expression and proliferation (r = 0.61, P = 0.035). These results indicate the in vivo effect of butyrate on apoptosis and proliferation is dependent on dietary lipid source. These results demonstrate the presence of an early coordinated colonocyte response by which fish oil and butyrate protects against colon tumorigenesis.

F. graminearum can also cause disease in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis LOX1 and LOX5 genes, which encode 9-lipoxygenases (9-LOXs), are targeted during this interaction to facilitate infection. LOX1 and LOX5 expression were upregulated in F. graminearum–inoculated plants and loss of LOX1 or LOX5 function resulted in enhanced disease resistance in the corresponding mutant plants. The enhanced resistance to F. graminearum infection in the lox1 and lox5 mutants was accompanied by more robust induction of salicylic acid (SA) accumulation and signaling and attenuation of jasmonic acid (JA) signaling in response to infection. The lox1- and lox5-conferred resistance was diminished in plants expressing the SA-degrading salicylate hydroxylase or by the application of methyl-JA. Results presented here suggest that plant 9-LOXs are engaged during infection to control the balance between SA and JA signaling to facilitate infection. Furthermore, since silencing of TaLpx-1 encoding a 9-LOX with homology to LOX1 and LOX5, resulted in enhanced resistance against F. graminearum in wheat, we suggest that 9-LOXs have a conserved role as susceptibility factors in disease caused by this important fungus in Arabidopsis and wheat.","https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/pdf/10.1094/MPMI-04-15-0096-R",""

Geochemical alterations of the reservoir rock are quantified by performing reactive transport simulations and subsequently rock physics models are used to translate the altered petrophysical properties into seismic responses.

To accomplish this, we first discuss the research that demonstrates that optimism is the natural state of mind for most people and therefore we posit that firm managers involved in preparing financial statements are likely to exhibit naturally occurring optimism. Second, we identify where natural optimism is most likely to have an impact on financial reporting. Third, we address the challenges involved with mitigating or eliminating natural optimism in financial reporting. Finally, we address the relationship between optimism and two other constructs often found in accounting—namely, overconfidence and motivated reasoning.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-horizons/article-pdf/30/1/79/15132/acch-51277.pdf",""

The findings show no significant gender difference in general larceny victimization, suggesting that Korean females are just as likely to be victims of theft of personal belongings as males. Consistent with the theory, physical proximity to crime and social disorder are significant predictors of larceny victimization for both males and females. However, public transportation appears to have unexpected protective influences for both gender groups, showing the importance of differences in national context. Overall, the current research provides partial support for routine activity theory’s applicability in explaining larceny victimization across gender groups outside of the Western context.

Characteristics of age, race, gender, and profession suggest a sustained preference for young, middle-class, and white depictions of characters. Young men were generally depicted as reserved with emotions and assertive. Films depicted older men as isolated, begrudgingly allowing family and acquaintances into their lives. Grief spurs men at any age into action-based plots of thrill and adventure though in reality widowers retain much of the same commonplace existence they had prior to a partner’s death. Understanding the gendered representation of grief can help to recognize the social construction of death and loss. These portrayals contribute to hegemonic norms of masculinity within mainstream media and to cultural understandings and expectations of grief, limiting the experience of bereavement to dichotomous genders.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1097184X15588591",""

Applying psychometric analysis, our analyses of survey data first show that unknown risk and dread risk are two underlying dimensions that can characterize different IS threats. Drawing broadly on the literature of information foraging theory, we examine the influence of risk characteristics on public searches for information on these threats. We utilize a search engine log to extract searches related to IS threats. We develop and estimate a system of equations with correlated individual-specific error terms using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. We find that the two risk characteristics exert differential impacts on information search behavior (including types of information sought, number of pages viewed, and length of query).

In this view, deep convection develops or decays almost instantly to remove any changes of convective instability, making the tropospheric temperature always tied to the boundary layer moist static energy. The present study examines the validity of the CQE hypothesis at different vertical levels using long-term sounding data from tropical convection centers. The results show that the tropical atmosphere is far from the CQE with much weaker warming in the middle and upper troposphere associated with the increase of boundary layer moist static energy. This is true for all the time scales resolved by the observational data, ranging from hourly to interannual and decadal variability. It is possibly caused by the ubiquitous existence of shallow convection and stratiform precipitation, both leading to sign reversal of heating from lower to upper troposphere. The simulations by 42 global climate models from phases 3 and 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparsion Project (CMIP3 and CMIP5) are also analyzed and compared with the observations.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jcli/article-pdf/28/11/4357/4039885/jcli-d-14-00681_1.pdf",""

We use cross‐level polynomial regression and data obtained early and 1 year later within an organization implementing a lean manufacturing transformation to model changes in individual perceptions. Results suggest that momentum perceptions are higher for “Champions” (stable and high perceptions over time) as compared to “Converts” (increasing perceptions over time), but momentum perceptions are lower for “Defectors” (decreasing perceptions over time) as compared to “Doubters” (stable and low perceptions over time).

The key driver of this dynamic is the customer-specific investments that the relationship entails. These investments result in larger fixed costs, greater operating leverage, and a higher probability of losses early in the relationship, but can significantly benefit the firm as the relationship matures. Although many of these money-losing firms in early-stage relationships were not studied in Patatoukas (2012), we find a market reaction to increases in customer concentration similar to that in his paper. This result provides powerful confirmatory evidence of the value of customer concentration. We document one of the intangible benefits of customer concentration, technology sharing, and show how this benefit increases as the relationship matures.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article-pdf/91/3/883/31474/accr-51246.pdf",""

Method: Participants monitored nonwords for target sounds during silent phoneme monitoring tasks across two distinct experiments. For Experiment 1, the 22 participants (11 AWNS, 11 AWS) silently monitored target phonemes in nonwords with initial stress. For Experiment 2, an additional cohort of 22 participants (11 AWNS, 11 AWS) silently monitored phonemes in nonwords with noninitial stress. Results: In Experiment 1, AWNS and AWS silently monitored target phonemes in initial stress stimuli with similar speed and accuracy. In Experiment 2, AWS demonstrated a within-group effect that was not present for AWNS. They required additional time when monitoring phonemes immediately following syllable boundary assignment in stimuli with noninitial stress. There was also a between-groups effect, with AWS exhibiting significantly greater errors identifying phonemes in nonwords with noninitial stress than AWNS. Conclusions: Findings suggest metrical properties may affect the time course of phonological encoding in AWS in a manner distinct from AWNS. Specifically, in the absence of initial stress, metrical encoding of the syllable boundary may delay speech planning in AWS and contribute to breakdowns in fluent speech production.","http://pubs.asha.org/doi/pdf/10.1044/2015_JSLHR-S-14-0111",""

When it is feasible, DTs are surgically resected; however, this often results in high recurrence rates. Recently, treatment with PF‐03084014, a potent γ‐secretase inhibitor, has been shown to have antitumor activity in several tumor types by affecting the WNT/β‐catenin pathway. Consequently, Notch pathway inhibition by PF‐03084014 might be a promising approach for DT treatment. METHODS: The expression of Notch pathway components was analyzed in DT tissues and cell strains with immunohistochemistry and Western blotting, respectively. A panel of DT cell strains was exposed to PF‐03084014 and evaluated for cell proliferation. Antitumor effects were assessed via cell cycle, apoptosis, and migration and invasion analysis. Cells treated with PF‐03084014 were characterized with a gene array analysis combined with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. RESULTS: The results showed that Notch pathway components were expressed at different levels in DTs. Hes1 (Hes Family BHLH Transcription Factor 1) was overexpressed in DT tumors versus dermal scar tissue, and PF‐03084014 caused significant decreases in Notch intracellular domain and Hes1 expression in DT cell strains. PF‐03084014 decreased DT cell migration and invasion and also caused cell growth inhibition in DT cell strains, most likely through cell cycle arrest. Gene array analysis combined with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis showed that Wnt1‐inducible signaling pathway protein 2 possibly regulated Notch and WNT pathways after treatment with PF‐03084014 through integrin. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the Notch pathway is an important DT therapeutic target. Furthermore, PF‐03084014 has significant antitumor activity against DTs, and it may be an alternative strategy for DT treatment.","http://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fcncr.29564",""

Although it is responsible for degradation or processing of a wide variety of substrate RNAs, it is very specific and distinguishes between substrate and non-substrate RNAs as well as between substrates that need to be 3′ processed and those that need to be completely degraded. This specificity does not appear to be determined by the exosome itself but rather by about a dozen other proteins. Four of these exosome cofactors have enzymatic activity, namely, the nuclear RNA-dependent ATPase Mtr4, its cytoplasmic paralog Ski2 and the nuclear non-canonical poly(A) polymerases, Trf4 and Trf5. Mtr4 and either Trf4 or Trf5 assemble into a TRAMP complex. However, how these enzymes assemble into a TRAMP complex and the functional consequences of TRAMP complex assembly remain unknown. Here, we identify an important interaction site between Mtr4 and Trf5, and show that disrupting the Mtr4/Trf interaction disrupts specific TRAMP and exosome functions, including snoRNA processing.","https://academic.oup.com/nar/article-pdf/43/3/1848/50043568/nar_43_3_1848.pdf",""

Review of publication history suggests that relatively less research attention was allocated to bilingualism during last 20 years compared to issues related to monolingualism. Maximum number of publication was observed between the year 1998 and 2007. English has been the primary language investigated as an first language (L1) and also as a second language (L2) of both the experimental and the control groups.

The design of optimal coronavirus vaccines therefore remains a priority. Such vaccines present major challenges: coronavirus immunity often wanes rapidly, individuals needing to be protected include the elderly, and vaccines may exacerbate rather than prevent coronavirus lung immunopathology. To address these issues, we compared in a murine model a range of recombinant spike protein or inactivated whole-virus vaccine candidates alone or adjuvanted with either alum, CpG, or Advax, a new delta inulin-based polysaccharide adjuvant. While all vaccines protected against lethal infection, addition of adjuvant significantly increased serum neutralizing-antibody titers and reduced lung virus titers on day 3 postchallenge. Whereas unadjuvanted or alum-formulated vaccines were associated with significantly increased lung eosinophilic immunopathology on day 6 postchallenge, this was not seen in mice immunized with vaccines formulated with delta inulin adjuvant. Protection against eosinophilic immunopathology by vaccines containing delta inulin adjuvants correlated better with enhanced T-cell gamma interferon (IFN-γ) recall responses rather than reduced interleukin-4 (IL-4) responses, suggesting that immunopathology predominantly reflects an inadequate vaccine-induced Th1 response. This study highlights the critical importance for development of effective and safe coronavirus vaccines of selection of adjuvants based on the ability to induce durable IFN-γ responses.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.02980-14",""

METHODS:: Longitudinal retrospective cross-sectional study using the Texas Hospital Inpatient Discharge Database, including all pediatric hospitalizations in the state of Texas, 2004 to 2010. RESULTS:: Texas has an average of 591 571 pediatric hospitalizations per year. Birth was the most common reason for hospitalization, representing 64% of all pediatric hospitalization annually in Texas. Respiratory illnesses were the most common discharge diagnosis for hospitalized children ages 1 month to 9 years and demonstrated a 2% decrease over the study period. The rate of hospitalizations for digestive conditions and childbirth also demonstrated a decrease over this time frame: 4.7% and 3.0%, respectively. The rate of mental illness diagnoses increased 2.5% over the time frame and represented the most common discharge diagnosis for children aged 10 to 14. Childbirth was the most common reason for hospitalization for adolescents aged 15 to 17 years. There was no increase in total cost of pediatric hospitalizations over the time period under study. CONCLUSIONS:: After birth, respiratory illnesses represent the most common reason for hospitalization for children (between 1 month and 10 years of age) in Texas.

Conventional applications of Gassmann’s equation require a complete homogeneity inside the porous media (or equivalently, at zero frequency) and closed boundary condition. We first analyzed the fluid effect on the bulk modulus in homogeneous porous media with a nonclosed condition. The partial drainage of pore fluid causes additional pore volume change under applied stress. An incoming fluid flow stiffens the porous system, and an outgoing flow softens it. Such a phenomenon can still be effectively formulated as a closed system with Gassmann’s equation, by introducing a DFM, which adds a flow term into the original fluid modulus. We further proved that in heterogeneous porous media, the wave-induced internal fluid flow caused additional bulk volume deformation. It equals the amount of the fluid flow from a soft phase to a stiff phase times the difference of Skempton coefficients between the two phases. Again, with a frequency-dependent complex number DFM, the use of Gassmann’s equation can be extended into heterogeneous porous media at nonzero frequencies to fully characterize its viscoelastic behavior on rock’s bulk modulus. We evaluated three examples to show how to model the P-wave attenuation and velocity dispersion in porous media due to microscopic and mesoscopic scale heterogeneities, as well as in the presence of multiple sets of heterogeneities. Finally, we demonstrated that the DFM can be conveniently and deterministically inverted from the measured lab data. The inverted results can be used to identify the possible mechanisms behind the observed wave attenuation and velocity dispersion, and they were good indicators of the degree and distribution of heterogeneities inside the rocks.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/geo2013-0410.1",""

Restoration of lost behaviors following severance of mammalian peripheral nerve axons (PNAs) relies on regeneration by slow outgrowths and is typically poor or nonexistent when after ablation or injuries close to the soma. Behavioral recovery after severing spinal tract axons (STAs) is poor because STAs do not naturally regenerate. Current techniques to enhance PNA and/or STA regeneration have had limited success and do not prevent the onset of Wallerian degeneration of severed distal segments. This Review describes the use of a recently developed polyethylene glycol (PEG) fusion technology combining concepts from biochemical engineering, cell biology, and clinical microsurgery. Within minutes after microsuturing carefully trimmed cut ends and applying a well‐specified sequence of solutions, PEG‐fused axons exhibit morphological continuity (assessed by intra‐axonal dye diffusion) and electrophysiological continuity (assessed by conduction of action potentials) across the lesion site. Wallerian degeneration of PEG‐fused PNAs is greatly reduced as measured by counts of sensory and/or motor axons and maintenance of axonal diameters and neuromuscular synapses. After PEG‐fusion repair, cut‐severed, crush‐severed, or ablated PNAs or crush‐severed STAs rapidly (within days to weeks), more completely, and permanently restore PNA‐ or STA‐mediated behaviors compared with nontreated or conventionally treated animals.

No such studies were found on radon. Our objective was to determine if there is an association between living in areas with higher radon levels and birth defects. Methods: The Texas Birth Defects Registry provided data on all birth defects from 1999 to 2009 from the entire state. Mean radon levels by geologic region came from the Texas Indoor Radon Survey. The association between radon and birth defects was estimated using multilevel mixed effect Poisson regression. Results: Birth defects overall were not associated with residential radon levels. Of the 100 other birth defect groups with at least 500 cases, 14 were significantly elevated in areas with high mean radon level in crude analyses, and 9 after adjustment for confounders. Cleft lip with/without cleft palate had an adjusted prevalence ratio of 1.16 per 1 picoCurie/liter (pCi/L) increase in exposure to region mean radon, 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.26.

In these elementary studies, increasing the stress anisotropy was found to decrease the curving of a propagating NF, and this could be used to explain the observed trends in the microseismic data. The workflow was applied to Marcellus and Eagle Ford wells, where multiple geomechanical results were validated with microseismic data and tracer tests. Application of the workflow to a Marcellus well provides a strain field that correlates well with microseismicity, and a maximum energy release rate, or [Formula: see text] integral at each completion stage, which appeared to correlate to the production log and could be used to quantify the impact of skipping the completion stages. On the first of two Eagle Ford wells considered, the MPM workflow provided a horizontal differential stress map that showed significant variability imparted by NFs perturbing the regional stress field. Additionally, a map of the strain distribution after stimulating the well showed the same features as the interpreted microseismic data: three distinct regions of microseismic character, supported by tracer tests and explained by the MPM differential stress map. Finally, the workflow was able to estimate, in the second well with no microseismic data, its main performance characteristics as validated by tracer tests. The field-validated MPM geomechanical workflow is a powerful tool for completion optimization in the presence of NFs, which affect in multiple ways the final outcome of hydraulic fracturing.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/INT-2014-0274.1",""

Results of several studies have also revealed that working on homework assignments with a significant independent effort enables students to develop higher cognitive level creative problem solving skills that they need in school (for example, to perform better in exams) and as practicing engineers. However, the availability and use of textbook solution manuals and other unapproved outside sources have hindered students from achieving the skills. Previous studies indicated that almost 90% of students used text book solution manuals at least once without permission and students with no access to solution manuals performed better than those who have. These two findings indicate that there is a need for developing alternative techniques that can possibly enhance homework assignments in order to stimulate the independent creative problem-solving skills of students. In this project, readily available and new alternate techniques to enhance traditional homework assignments have been identified, and a novel comprehensive assessment technique has been developed and implemented. The impact and effectiveness of the technique has been studied via conducting a survey and the comparison of exam averages of three semesters with and without the implementation of the technique. The results indicate that the technique helps deter cheating enhances critical thinking and problem solving skills of students and improve their performance in exams. Furthermore, the implementation of the technique is believed to have boosted students learning of the material of an undergraduate Engineering Mechanics: Dynamics course given at a large public university.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0306419015611243",""

Similarly, water delivery and removal drives decomposition of moist-soil plants as well as nutrient cycling within these systems, which is a key driver of productivity in such managed wetlands. Through deployment of litter bags, we examined rate of mass loss and decay coefficients of three locally abundant moist-soil annual species that are potentially valuable wintering-waterfowl food sources (nodding smartweed Persicaria lapathifolia, red-rooted flatnut sedge Cyperus erythrorhizos, and toothcup Ammannia coccinea) within man-made moist-soil managed wetlands on the Richland Creek Wildlife Management Area in East-central Texas. All three species lost nearly 100% of their mass during an 11-mo deployment period, where rate of mass lost and decay coefficient rates were driven by time, because all moist-soil managed wetlands used were inundated for the duration of this study. Plant materials exposed to persistent inundation in shallow wetlands exhibited rates of mass loss typical of the first two stages of decomposition, during which a majority of plant material mass was lost. However, during this study, typical inundation and drawdown regimes were not implemented, which may have delayed or prolonged decomposition processes, because litter bags of focal species were inundated for the duration of this study. Both locally and regionally specific moist-soil management hydroperiod manipulation should include both drawdown and inundation, to incorporate temporal transitions between these conditions. Such practices will allow wetland managers to more expeditiously meet plant management and waterfowl food production goals within moist-soil managed wetlands.","http://meridian.allenpress.com/jfwm/article-pdf/6/1/102/2387685/072013-jfwm-050.pdf",""

Our results indicated a GHG emission with these grazing treatments of 8034.90 kg·CO2e·calf−1·year−1 for cow-calf farms in SGP region, which is high, compared to that for other regions, due to the high percentage (79.6%) of enteric CH4 emissions caused by relatively lower feed quality on the unfertilized rangeland. Sensitivity analyses on MP grazing strategy showed that an increase in grass quality and digestibility could potentially reduce GHG emission by 30%.

Methods: This cross-sectional, self-report study measured willingness, attitude, experiences, and barriers related to SDM as well as demographic/practice characteristics. A survey was e-mailed to psychiatric providers at 3 psychiatric institutions. Results: Out of 80 providers e-mailed, 29 (36.3%) responded. Providers had a favorable attitude toward SDM (3.26 ± 0.24, range = 1-4) and a high willingness to use SDM (3.43 ± 0.50, range = 1-4).

However, studies of contextual effects often operationalize “neighborhoods” as static, single-level administrative units that are chosen for data availability rather than theoretical reasons. This practice has led to new calls for sound conceptual models that guide data collection efforts and statistical analyses related to these phenomena. While many such models are in use or being proposed in the social sciences, this article argues that research in the field of evolutionary studies offers alternative and interesting ways of investigating neighborhood effects. Accordingly, the article pursues two objectives. First, it makes connections between neighborhood effects research in the social sciences and relevant literature in evolutionary game theory and evolutionary urban geography. Second, these interdisciplinary interactions guide the development of a cross-level conceptual model of neighborhood effects on urban social behavior. The conceptual model is then translated into an empirical model that tests whether and how property maintenance behavior in a selected U.S. study area changes as a function of neighborhood context. The findings reveal that neighborhood effects operate at multiple, interacting spatial levels in the study area, which suggests that conventional single-level administrative boundaries are not equipped to capture these effects. While they are proffered as exploratory, the results nonetheless imply that insights from evolutionary research can add depth and theoretical grounding to contextual effects studies in the social sciences.","https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/4/4/1046/pdf",""

It develops answers to this question by using insights from Durkheimian and neo-Durkheimian scholarship and the empirical case of modern privatized punishment in the United States. The article proposes three trajectories through which privatized punishment may (or may not) affect solidarity: Parity in Punishment, in which private and public punishers are seen as interchangeable; Public Interest, in which perceptions of greed and self-interest mar privatized punishment and sap it of its functional effects; and Sacred Transgressions, in which the private sector encroaches on sacred rites of punishment to the detriment of solidarity.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2329496515604641",""

We examined variables including post frequency, content type, illocutionary act, linking style, and media. We found that entertainment posts were more engaging than operational news and innovation posts. Educational posts were also more engaging than innovation posts. With regard to illocutionary acts, expressives, or posts that express the writer’s emotion, were more engaging than all other illocutionary acts. Additionally, representative posts were more engaging than directive posts. For linking style, we discovered that posts containing no link were actually more engaging than posts with an external link. We also found a significant interaction between content type and linking practice, which indicates that linking style influences the effectiveness of some content types in engaging audiences. Finally, we found that companies overwhelmingly relied on the use of text and images in their posts over video and image galleries.

To predict the persistence of these contaminants in soils, factors that impact rates of metal removal from soils into streams must be understood. Experiments at containerized seedling (mesocosm), pedon, and catchment scales were used to investigate the influence of vegetation on manganese (Mn) transport at the Susquehanna/Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory (SSHCZO) in Pennsylvania, USA, where past atmospheric inputs from industrial sources have enriched Mn in surface soils. Large quantities of Mn that were leached from soil components into solution were taken up by vegetation; as a result, only relatively small quantities of Mn were removed from soil into effluent and streams. Manganese uptake into vegetation exceeded Mn losses in soil leachate by 20–200X at all scales, and net Mn loss from soils decreased in the presence of vegetation due to uptake into plant tissues. The majority of Mn taken up by forest vegetation at SSHCZO each year was returned to the soil in leaf litter and consequently immobilized as Mn oxides that formed during litter decomposition. Thus, plant uptake of Mn combined with rapid oxidation of Mn during litter decomposition contribute to long‐term retention. Current release rates of soluble Mn from SSHCZO soils were similar to release rates from the larger Susquehanna River Basin, indicating that the processes observed at SSHCZO may be widespread across the region. Indeed, although atmospheric deposition of Mn has declined, surface soils at SSHCZO and throughout the eastern United States remain enriched in Mn. If recycling through vegetation can attenuate the removal of Mn from soils, as observed in this study, then Mn concentrations in soils and river waters will likely decrease slowly over time following watershed contamination. Understanding the role of vegetation in regulating metal transport is important for evaluating the long‐term effects of historical and ongoing metal loading to soils.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2F2014GB004858",""

Using birth certificate records in Texas from 2002 to 2004 and Environmental Protection Agency air pollution estimates, we relate the quantile functions of birth weight and gestational age to ozone exposure and multiple predictors, including parental age, race, and education level. We introduce a semi-parametric Bayesian quantile approach that models the full quantile function rather than just a few quantile levels. Our multilevel quantile function model establishes relationships between birth weight and the predictors separately for each week of gestational age and between gestational age and the predictors separately across Texas Public Health Regions. We permit these relationships to vary nonlinearly across gestational age, spatial domain and quantile level and we unite them in a hierarchical model via a basis expansion on the regression coefficients that preserves interpretability. Very low birth weight is a primary concern, so we leverage extreme value theory to supplement our model in the tail of the distribution. Gestational ages are recorded in completed weeks of gestation (integer-valued), so we present methodology for modeling quantile functions of discrete response data. In a simulation study we show that pooling information across gestational age and quantile level substantially reduces MSE of predictor effects. We find that ozone is negatively associated with the lower tail of gestational age in south Texas and across the distribution of birth weight for high gestational ages.

This disease is commonly caused by an imbalance of progesterone (P4) and estrogen (E2) action that E2 stimulates proliferation of uterine epithelial cells while P4 is inhibitory to estrogen-mediated proliferation of the epithelium. Endometrial hyperplasia is also associated with endometrial cancer, which is a proliferative process in epithelium by E2. Responsiveness of progesterone is required to treat endometrial cancer and preserve the fertility of patients. Furthermore, PR expression in the uteri of patients with endometrial cancer has been used as an indicator for a first-rate prognosis. However, more than 30% of patients do not respond to progesterone treatment as a result of progesterone resistance and the mechanism of progesterone resistance is still unknown. Thus, identifying the mechanism of progesterone in endometrial cancer is essential to improve the therapy of this disease. Mitogen-inducible gene 6 (Mig-6) is an important mediator of progesterone receptor (PR) action in the murine uterus. As P4 achieves the inhibition of proliferation by coordinating stromal-epithelial cross-talk, we generated a mouse model in which we specifically ablate epithelial endometrial Mig-6 using Sprr2f-cre mice (Sprr2fcre+ Mig-6f/f) to understand the role of epithelial Mig-6 in the uterus. Sprr2fcre+ Mig-6f/f mice displayed endometrial hyperplasia upon 10 weeks of age and develop endometrial cancer by E2 treatment for 3 months. Interestingly, the hyperplasia exhibited by Sprr2fcre+ Mig-6f/f mice was prevented by P4 treatment for 1 week in morphological and histological analysis. Proliferation decreased in the glandular epithelium of Sprr2fcre+ Mig-6f/f mice by P4, and apoptotic signal was also reduced. The expressions of stromal PR and its target genes were induced in Sprr2fcre+ Mig-6f/f mice after P4 treatment, indicating that P4-induced stromal Mig-6 can prevent the hyperplasia via regulating steroid hormonal signaling. This study suggested that stromal-epithelial communication of Mig-6 is critical in tumor suppressor function via regulating steroid hormonal signaling by progesterone.

We used kernel analysis to estimate home ranges and core areas for these species. We estimated home-range overlap within and among species using the utilization distribution overlap index (UDOI) and percent overlap. Bobcat and coyote home ranges were similar in extent, whereas raccoons had substantially smaller home ranges. Only bobcats displayed seasonal differences in home-range size. Male bobcats had larger home ranges than female bobcats; there was no sex-based differentiation in home range or core area for coyotes or raccoons. Home-range overlaps calculated using percent overlap were consistently larger than UDOI estimates. Percent overlap seemed to exaggerate the extent to which individuals of the same species share space. Bobcats and coyotes shared space more than raccoons did with either bobcats or coyotes, which indicates that raccoons may have avoided areas used by trophically higher ranking mesopredators or that species with similar feeding strategies had lower levels of overlap to avoid competition.","http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/full-xml/10.1139/cjz-2014-0322",""

Due to the convenience of image processing software (e.g., FreeSurfer), standard practice is to rely on automated results without performing visual inspection of intermediate processing. In this work, structural MRIs of 40 healthy controls who were scanned twice were used to determine the test–retest reliability of FreeSurfer‐derived cortical measures in four groups of subjects—those 25 that passed visual inspection (approved), those 15 that failed visual inspection (disapproved), a combined group, and a subset of 10 subjects (Travel) whose test and retest scans occurred at different sites. Test–retest correlation (TRC), intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and percent difference (PD) were used to measure the reliability in the Destrieux and Desikan–Killiany (DK) atlases. In the approved subjects, reliability of cortical thickness/surface area/volume (DK atlas only) were: TRC (0.82/0.88/0.88), ICC (0.81/0.87/0.88), PD (0.86/1.19/1.39), which represent a significant improvement over these measures when disapproved subjects are included. Travel subjects’ results show that cortical thickness reliability is more sensitive to site differences than the cortical surface area and volume. To determine the effect of visual inspection on sample size required for studies of MRI‐derived cortical thickness, the number of subjects required to show group differences was calculated. Significant differences observed across imaging sites, between visually approved/disapproved subjects, and across regions with different sizes suggest that these measures should be used with caution.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fhbm.22856",""

In this study, the authors review the operative techniques and surgical outcomes of 156 surgical repairs of the SAN following iatrogenic injury during lymph node biopsy procedures. METHODS: This retrospective study examines the authors’ clinical and surgical experience with 156 patients with SAN injury between 1980 and 2012. All patients suffered iatrogenic SAN injuries during lymph node biopsy, with the vast majority (154/156, 98.7%) occurring in Zone I of the PCT. Surgery was performed on the basis of anatomical and electro-physiological findings at the time of the operation. The mean follow-up period was 24 months (range 8–44 months). RESULTS: Of the 123 patients who underwent graft or suture repair, 107 patients (87%) improved to Grade 3 functionality or higher using the Louisiana State University Health Science Center (LSUHSC) grading system. Neurolysis was performed in 29 patients (19%) when the nerve was found in continuity with recordable nerve action potential (NAP) across the lesion. More than 95% of patients treated by neurolysis with positive NAP recordings recovered to LSUHSC Grade 3 or higher. Forty-one patients (26%) underwent end-to-end repair, while 82 patients (53%) underwent graft repair, and Grade 3 or higher recovery was assessed for 90% and 85% of these patients, respectively. The average graft length used was 3.81 cm. Neurotization was performed in 4 patients, 2 of whom recovered to Grade 2 and 3, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: SAN injuries present challenges for surgical exploration and repair because of the nerve’s size and location in the PCT.

However, it has been a major challenge to use standard pharmacologic approaches to target loss‐of‐function mutations of tumor suppressor genes.

The extrinsic resistance that arises from the surrounding dense tumor stroma is much better understood. However, the mechanisms of intrinsic resistance are not well understood. Here, we report that reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by gemcitabine treatment, a newly discovered cytotoxic activity, served as a probe in our study to reveal the mechanisms of the intrinsic therapeutic resistance. Our results showed that gemcitabine-induced ROS is generated by NOX and through the increase of p22−phox expression via NF-κB activation. As a feedback mechanism, nuclear translocation of Nrf2 stimulated the transcription of cytoprotective antioxidant genes, especially genes encoding enzymes that catalyze glutathione (GSH) production to reduce elevated ROS as an intrinsic resistance countermeasure. RNAi-mediated depletion of Nrf2 or addition of β-phenylethyl isothiocyanate inhibited the ROS detoxification process by reducing GSH levels, which, in turn, increased the efficacy of gemcitabine in vitro and in vivo. Thus, our study suggests that a redox-mediated pathway contributes to the intrinsic resistance of PDAC to gemcitabine and provides a basis for developing strategies to preferentially kill PDAC cells through ROS-mediated mechanism. The combination of gemcitabine and PEITC has a selective cytotoxic effect against pancreatic cancer cells in vivo and could thus prove valuable as a cancer treatment.

The Ets1 transcription factor acts in B cells to prevent PC differentiation. Ets1−/− mice accumulate PCs and produce autoantibodies. Ets1 expression is downregulated upon B cell activation through the BCR and TLRs and is maintained by the inhibitory signaling pathway mediated by Lyn, CD22 and SiglecG, and SHP-1. In the absence of these inhibitory components, Ets1 levels are reduced in B cells in a Btk-dependent manner. This leads to increased PCs, autoantibodies, and an autoimmune phenotype similar to that of Ets1−/− mice. Defects in inhibitory signaling molecules, including Lyn and Ets1, are associated with human lupus, although the effects are more subtle than the complete deficiency that occurs in knockout mice. In this study, we explore the effect of partial disruption of the Lyn/Ets1 pathway on B cell tolerance and find that Lyn+/−Ets1+/− mice demonstrate greater and earlier production of IgM, but not IgG, autoantibodies compared with Lyn+/− or Ets1+/− mice. We also show that Btk-dependent downregulation of Ets1 is important for normal PC homeostasis when inhibitory signaling is intact. Ets1 deficiency restores the decrease in steady state PCs and Ab levels observed in Btk−/− mice. Thus, depending on the balance of activating and inhibitory signals to Ets1, there is a continuum of effects on autoantibody production and PC maintenance. This ranges from full-blown autoimmunity with complete loss of Ets1-maintaining signals to reduced PC and Ab levels with impaired Ets1 downregulation.","https://journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article-pdf/195/5/1955/1409339/1500165.pdf",""

Higher levels of relationship satisfaction among women who transition “late,” however, appear to be explained by their lower likelihood of experiencing forced sexual relations and sexually transmitted infections. We find no evidence of any association between timing of oral sex initiation and relationship satisfaction among men. To best promote healthy relationships, researchers, practitioners, and educators need to better understand the various types of sexual activities in which young people engage.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0192513X15613826",""

These hypotheses are built on the theoretical foundation of officer suspicion, the group hazard hypothesis, the principles of symbolic interactionism, and Black’s theory of law. Methods:: Traffic stop data from a large, urban city are used to test these hypotheses. Multilevel, Bernoulli models are estimated to reflect the nested nature of the data. Data are analyzed in multiple ways to reflect the complex elements of police–citizen encounters. Results:: Results indicate that discretionary searches of a citizen are more likely when a passenger is present. While some group effects are also documented, minority groups are not more likely to be searched such that the presence of passengers appears to supersede the impact of race/ethnicity.

Specifically, we identify cognitive conflict as a nonlinear phenomenon and test whether the presence of an organizational crisis alters the relationship between conflict types (cognitive and affective) and perceived decision quality and commitment. Our analysis of data from 264 executives comprising a total of 64 strategic decision-making (SDM) teams indicates that the effect of cognitive conflict on perceived strategic decision outcomes is, in fact, nonlinear. Furthermore, the findings of the study also revealed that organizational crisis is a significant moderator of the relationship between both level of cognitive and affective conflict and perceived strategic decision quality. These results help clarify the mixed findings about the effects of cognitive conflict within SDM teams and provide some insight on how SDM teams can maximize conflict in the decision-making process, without incurring its costs. More important, our findings indicate that high crisis contexts tend to lessen the influence of both cognitive and affective conflict on perceived strategic decision quality, suggesting that intrateam conflict dynamics among top management teams to some extent could be superseded by the urgent need for prompt decision making and collaboration. Implications for research and practice are discussed.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1548051815570038",""

The degradation profiles were investigated over a period of 60 days. The percentage of weight loss, percentage of water absorption, morphology, compressive, thermal, and material properties were studied as a function of degradation time. Weight loss and water absorption demonstrated a high correlation, which showed an increasing behavior with increase in cryomilling time and degradation time. Morphology of the scaffolds analyzed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed micro-cracks on the surface of the cylindrical struts due to hydrolytic attack and dissolution of hydrophilic PGA. Changes in compressive modulus and crystallinity over the degradation period and material properties were analyzed using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy.

Consistent with prior research, there was no overall link between social support and CRP levels. However, the association between social support and high sensitivity (hs)‐CRP levels was moderated by ethnicity/race as perceived support predicted lower hs‐CRP levels primarily in African Americans. These results suggest the importance of considering how ethnicity/race may inform models on the complex biological mechanisms linking social support to health.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fpsyp.12499",""

We have incorporated the dynamic poroelastic responses of mesoscopic flow into the classical Biot theory. The resulting effective Biot media could capture the characteristics of velocity dispersion and wave attenuation in heterogeneous poroelastic media. On the basis of this effective Biot media, an approach was developed to compute the poroelastic reflection at arbitrary angles and frequencies from the boundary of two heterogeneous porous media. The computed poroelastic reflections not only depended on the elastic properties’ contrast and incident angle, but also relied on the fluid mobility and observational frequency. For a typical sand-shale reflector, with the given rock and fluid properties, we found that the effect of mesoscopic flow causes P-wave reflection amplitude variations with the frequency being as high as 40% and a maximum phase shift as high as 16° at the seismic exploration frequency band. In addition, it was found that the amplitude variation with offset intercept and the gradient at the poroelastic interface were impacted by the mesoscopic flow and had a decreasing trend with frequency. Therefore, ignoring the impact of mesoscopic flow could possibly lead to uncertainty in seismic imaging as well as quantitative interpretation of reservoir properties. In comparison, the Biot flow-induced seismic dispersion effect, which occured at a very high-frequency range, was almost negligible.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/geo2014-0307.1",""

Methods: We examined the association between several baseline and procedural parameters with operator and patient radiation exposure using univariable and multivariable analysis in the 505 patients that were enrolled in RadiCure. All baseline demographic and procedure characteristics recorded were included in the univariable analysis. Results: Median fluoroscopy time was 6.2 (2.5–12.5) minutes, median patient air kerma dose was 0.908 (0.602–1.636) Gray and median first operator exposure was 10 (5–22) μSv. For analysis purposes, the 505 procedures were dichotomized based on the median operator exposure (10 μSv) and median patient radiation dose (0.908 Gray). On multivariable analysis, factors associated with high (above median or >10 μSv) first operator radiation exposure included radial access (odds ratio [OR] 5.44, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 2.88–10.76), chronic total occlusion (CTO) intervention (OR 12.78, 95% CI 4.42–43.60), real‐time radiation monitoring (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.26–0.66), and use of a radioabsorbent drape (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.28–0.96).

A general approach without screening requires folding of kernels of the integral equations with the Coulomb wave. A new method of folding a function with the Coulomb partial waves is presented. The partial-wave Coulomb function both in the configuration and momentum representations is written in the form of separable series. Each term of the series is represented as a product of a factor depending only on the Coulomb parameter and a function depending on the spatial variable in the configuration space and the momentum variable if the momentum representation is used. Using a trial function, the method is demonstrated to be efficient and reliable.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jmp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.4919674/15643678/052102_1_online.pdf",""

This study conducts finite element (FE) simulations on four types of cornea-like structures as well as optical coherence elastography (OCE) experiments on contact lenses and tissue-mimicking phantoms to investigate the effects of curvature and thickness on the group velocity of an elastic wave. The elastic wave velocity as determined by FE simulations and OCE of a spherical shell section decreased from ∼2.8 m/s to ∼2.2 m/s as the radius of curvature increased from 19.1 mm to 47.7 mm and increased from ∼3.0 m/s to ∼4.1 m/s as the thickness of the agar phantom increased from 1.9 mm to 5.6 mm.

In developmentally delayed children, rumination is a pleasurable, self-stimulating habit. For 3 years, we evaluated and treated 2 nonambulatory, nonverbal 4-year-old children who ruminated frequently while awake. The social isolation caused by a child covered in regurgitated food prompted caregivers of these children to find a solution. We hypothesized that rumination would cease if the stomach stayed empty of food. We intervened by placing gastrojejunostomy tubes and then initiated continuous drip jejunal tube feedings over 12 waking hours to reduce hunger; the children’s oral diet was also stopped. In both cases, these changes reduced episodes of rumination to 3 to 5 times daily. To eliminate rumination, unpleasant tasting substances (N-acetylcysteine or cayenne pepper–based hot sauce) were given through the gastrostomy tube every 4 hours while the children were awake. Within 1 week of adding the unpalatable substances, rumination ceased. After 2 months of no rumination, 1 mother restarted oral feeding. There was no recurrence of rumination, and 3 months after gastrojejunal tube placement, the tube was removed. In 1 year of follow-up, rumination did not recur. The second mother was pleased with the outcome with jejunal feedings and chose not to resume oral feedings.

Videotaped dyadic interactions were transcribed and qualitatively coded using iterative confirmatory and exploratory approaches. Quantitative indicators confirmed the categorization of couples into discourse styles, as well as elucidated the contexts and extent of overlap of developmental and cultural themes. Nine of ten couples had a serious discussion of relational conflict issues, lasting a majority of the time allotted (14 minutes). Five couples’ conversations were consumed by blaming/criticizing, interrupted by small stretches of one-sided taking of responsibility, suggestions, or voiced intentions for new behaviors to resolve the conflict. The remaining four couples enhanced their understanding of the relationship through mutual and respectful exploration of their chosen conflict issues. Culturally salient themes were identified, including adaptive machismo, familismo, and caballero care. The latter denoted bids for demonstration of care or affection from a girl on behalf of her partner, which together with discussion of family-oriented topics, contextualized the content of conflict discussions.

A number of different antiretroviral drugs are used to manage patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Objective. This study describes antiretroviral drug exposures reported to a large statewide poison center system. Methods. Cases were all antiretroviral drug exposures reported to the Texas Poison Center Network during 2000 to 2014. The distribution of cases was determined for various demographic and clinical factors. Results. Of a total of 632 exposures, the most commonly reported drugs were emtricitabine–tenofovir combination (17.1%), efavirenz–emtricitabine–tenofovir combination (13.8%), ritonavir (10.9%), lamivudine–zidovudine combination (10.3%), and efavirenz (10.1%).

The exposures were 58.5% unintentional and 37.5% intentional. Only antiretroviral drugs were reported in 440 of the exposures. Of these exposures, 62.5% were managed on site, 28.0% were already at or en route to a health care facility when the poison center was contacted, and 8.6% were referred to a health care facility.

This paper explores the forces determining U.S. veterinarian practice location and how location choices have evolved over the past two decades. We provide a theoretical model of veterinarian market supply and demand with particular emphasis on rurality, gender, and demand side change. We also estimate bivariate Tobit models of location choice for 1990, 2000, and 2010. Results suggest that female veterinarians are less responsive to the presence of food animals than their male counterparts. For both genders, veterinarians are more responsive to animals of higher value. Using animal caretakers as a proxy for companion animals, we find that female veterinarians have become more responsive to this indicator over the 20 years. All else equal, female and male veterinarians tend not to locate in rural areas. Aversion to rural areas has remained fixed over time among males but has strengthened among females.

The distribution of all mefloquine ingestions reported to Texas poison centers during 2010 to 2014 was determined for dose, year, patient age and gender, exposure site, ingestion reason, management site, medical outcome, clinical effects, and treatments. Results. Of 63 total cases, the mean dose was 672 mg (range = 188-3500 mg). The patient age distribution was 5 years or less (27.0%), 6 to 19 years (12.7%), and 20 years or more (58.7%); 52.4% of the patients were male.

We have discovered that redatuming of surface sources to the shallow buried receivers produced a reliable image of target reflectors despite the fact that receivers were placed in the near-field zone of the source. We redatumed data with the virtual source method using crosscorrelation of the measured wavefields. We found that redatuming also reduced nonrepeatability of seismic data associated with changes in acquisition geometry, variable source coupling, and daily/seasonal variations in the near surface.

Detection thresholds of Mandarin Chinese and Korean vowels and non-speech sounds in noise, frequency selectivity, and the nativeness of Mandarin Chinese and Korean vowels were measured for Mandarin Chinese- and Korean-native listeners. The two groups of listeners exhibited similar non-speech sound detection and frequency selectivity; however, the Korean listeners had better detection thresholds of Korean vowels than Chinese listeners, while the Chinese listeners performed no better at Chinese vowel detection than the Korean listeners. Moreover, thresholds predicted from an auditory model highly correlated with behavioral thresholds of the two groups of listeners, suggesting that detection of speech sounds not only depended on listeners' frequency selectivity, but also might be affected by their native language experience. Listeners evaluated their native vowels with higher nativeness scores than non-native listeners. Native listeners may have advantages over non-native listeners when processing speech sounds in noise, even without the required phonetic processing; however, such native speech advantages might be offset by Chinese listeners' lower sensitivity to vowel sounds, a characteristic possibly resulting from their sparse vowel system and their greater cognitive and attentional demands for vowel processing.","https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article-pdf/138/5/2782/13777490/2782_1_online.pdf",""

Specifically, results show that a match between store-unit racial diversity and community racial diversity positively related to store-unit sales performance. In addition, superior store-unit performance emerged when store units and communities had congruent levels of diversity at high (i.e., high-high racial diversity congruence) rather than low (i.e., low-low racial diversity congruence) levels.

The results indicate that people distinguish among the exposure paths, but the differences are small (one-third to one-half of the response scale). Nonetheless, the perceived risk from the exposure paths helps to explain why people are expected to consume (or actually consumed) bottled water rather than boiled or personally chlorinated water. Overall, these results indicate that local authorities should take care to communicate the relative risks of different exposure paths and should expect that people will respond to a boil water order primarily by consuming bottled water. Thus, they should make special efforts to increase supplies of bottled water in their communities during water contamination emergencies.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.4137/EHI.S33383",""

It is proved that, except in one special case where the scattering matrix has no bound states and its value is +1 at zero energy, the determination by the scattering matrix is unique. In the special case, it is shown that there are exactly two distinct sets consisting of a potential and a boundary parameter yielding the same scattering matrix, and a characterization of the nonuniqueness is provided. A reconstruction from the scattering matrix is outlined yielding all the corresponding potentials and boundary parameters. The concept of “eligible resonances” is introduced, and such resonances correspond to real-energy resonances that can be converted into bound states via a Darboux transformation without changing the compact support of the potential. It is proved that the determination of the boundary parameter and the potential by the absolute value of the Jost function is unique up to the inclusion of eligible resonances. Several equivalent characterizations are provided to determine whether a resonance is eligible or ineligible.

The positive effect of delayed retrieval practice on subsequent test performance is robust; by contrast, making delayed judgments of learning (JOLs) encourages covert retrieval but has a minor influence on final test performance. In three experiments, we experimentally established and explored this memory-metamemory paradox. After initial study of paired associates (e.g., husky – ram), participants either were explicitly tested (husky – ?) or made a JOL. In Experiment 1, we adopted the standard JOL method, using a short retention interval, whereas in Experiments 2 and 3, we used a common testing-effect method involving a longer retention interval. Delayed JOLs did not boost test performance, but explicit delayed tests boosted memory after a longer retention interval. As important, participants spent less time to make JOLs than to retrieve responses. These data indicate that differences in the dynamics of retrieval for practice tests versus delayed JOLs are responsible for the paradox.","https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/pdf/10.1027/1618-3169/a000296",""

We evaluated physical activity of children and adolescents, considered time spent in each activity intensity category, and explored the impact of growth disruption (stunting and wasting) on physical activity patterns. Methods: Participants wore an Actical (Mini‐Mitter, Bend, OR) omnidirectional accelerometer for one week as part of their annual visit to the Jiri Growth Study. The percentage of time spent in standard activity intensities were computed using standard metabolic equivalents (METS) cutpoints and compared by chronological age, sex, and school versus non‐school days. Results: Primary findings include (1) children are more active on non‐school days and adolescents are more active during the school week; (2) Jirel children do not exhibit the reduction in physical activity that most Western populations experience during the transition from childhood to adolescence; and (3) Jirel children and adolescents routinely meet the suggested one hour/day MVPA threshold; (4) Stunting is prevalent and factors leading to this growth disruption may contribute to the amount of time in sedentary or light physical activity. Conclusions: We report child and adolescent physical activity patterns from the Jirel population of eastern Nepal. In this rural context, children and adolescents are more active than populations reported from Western contexts.

The entire brain core WM voxels were surveyed to detect differences in WM microstructural development between 31 children with ASD of 2–7 years and 19 age‐matched children with typical development (TD), using measurements of fractional anisotropy (FA) and radial diffusivity (RD) from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The anatomical locations, distribution, and extent of the core WM voxels with atypical age‐dependent changes in a specific tract or tract group were delineated and evaluated by integrating the skeletonized WM with a digital atlas. Exclusively, unidirectional FA increases and RD decreases in widespread WM tracts were revealed in children with ASD before 4 years, with bi‐directional changes found for children with ASD of 2–7 years. Compared to progressive development that raised FA and lowered RD during 2–7 years in the TD group, flattened curves of WM maturation were found in multiple major WM tracts of all five tract groups, particularly associational and limbic tracts, in the ASD group with trend lines of ASD and TD crossed around 4 years. We found atypical age‐dependent changes of FA and RD widely and heterogeneously distributed in WM tracts of children with ASD. The early higher WM microstructural integrity before 4 years reflects abnormal neural patterning, connectivity, and pruning that may contribute to aberrant behavioral and cognitive development in ASD.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fhbm.23073",""

Polymorphisms in the SLAM family receptors are implicated in human and mouse model of lupus disease. The lupus-associated, somatically mutated, and class-switched pathogenic autoantibodies are generated in spontaneously developed germinal centers (GCs) in secondary lymphoid organs. The role and mechanism of B cell–intrinsic expression of polymorphic SLAM receptors that affect B cell tolerance at the GC checkpoint are not clear. In this study, we generated several bacterial artificial chromosome–transgenic mice that overexpress C57BL/6 (B6) alleles of different SLAM family genes on an autoimmune-prone B6.Sle1b background. B6.Sle1b mice overexpressing B6-derived Ly108 and CD84 exhibit a significant reduction in the spontaneously developed GC response and autoantibody production compared with B6.Sle1b mice. These data suggest a prominent role for Sle1b-derived Ly108 and CD84 in altering the GC checkpoint. We further confirm that expression of lupus-associated CD84 and Ly108 specifically on GC B cells in B6.Sle1b mice is sufficient to break B cell tolerance, leading to an increase in autoantibody production. In addition, we observe that B6.Sle1b B cells have reduced BCR signaling and a lower frequency of B cell–T cell conjugates; the reverse is seen in B6.Sle1b mice overexpressing B6 alleles of CD84 and Ly108. Finally, we find a significant decrease in apoptotic GC B cells in B6.Sle1b mice compared with B6 controls. Our study establishes a central role for GC B cell–specific CD84 and Ly108 expression in maintaining B cell tolerance in GCs and in preventing autoimmunity.","https://journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article-pdf/194/9/4130/1401661/1403023.pdf",""

Abdominal computed tomography scans done within 1 month of diagnosis were reviewed to estimate skeletal muscle area (SMA) and skeletal muscle index (SMI) at the L3 level. CXI was developed as follows: [Formula: see text] where SMI is the skeletal muscle index, Alb is the serum albumin, and NLR is the NLR neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method. Survival among various factors was calculated using the log-rank test. Multivariate Cox regression was used to perform survival analysis in order to estimate the effects of various factors. Results: Patients were divided into two groups around the median into stage I cachexia (CXI ≥35, n = 56) and stage II cachexia (CXI <35, n = 56). Groups did not differ in age, gender, ethnicity, or histology of cancer. Patients with stage II cachexia had significantly worse PFS (2.45 vs 5.43 months, P < 0.0001) and OS (3.45 vs 8.8 months, P = 0.0001) than those with stage I cachexia. On multivariate analysis adjusting for gender, race, and histology, patients with stage II cachexia were found to have worse PFS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27–2.95) and OS (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.0009–2.34).

Methods: The data for this study were collected via a mixed-methods online survey distributed through professional networks to reach teachers with experience supporting students who are braille readers in advanced mathematics. A device matrix was used to ask participants about three interrelated issues. First, which of the 35 assistive technologies presented did they use to aid students? Second, how was the technology implemented? And third, how did they rate the effectiveness of each device used? Open-response items provided space for additional tools and other feedback. Results: A total of 82 surveys were completed through the device matrix question. Results conclusively indicated that 20 of the 35 technologies were used; of these, 13 were used regardless of subject. More than half of the participants indicated that the same four technologies were implemented for student information access during class, guided practice, and independent practice.

We use detrital U–Pb zircon dating of metasedimentary rocks within the Knik River terrane in the western Chugach Mountains to show that a belt of Early Cretaceous amphibolite-facies metamorphic rocks along the BRF was formed when older mélange rocks of the Chugach accretionary complex were reworked in a sinistral-oblique thrust reactivation of the BRF during a period of forearc plutonism. The metamorphic subterrane of the Knik River terrane has a maximum depositional age (MDA) of 156.5 ± 1.5 Ma and a detrital zircon age spectrum that is indistinguishable from the Potter Creek assemblage of the Chugach accretionary complex, supporting correlation of these units. These ages contrast strongly with new and existing data that show Triassic to earliest Jurassic detrital zircon ages from metamorphic screens in the plutonic subterrane of the Knik River terrane, a fragmented Early Jurassic plutonic assemblage generally interpreted as the basement of the Peninsular terrane. Based on these findings, we propose the following new terminology for the Knik River terrane: (1) “Carpenter Creek metamorphic complex” for the Early Cretaceous “metamorphic subterrane”, (2) “western Chugach trondhjemite suite” for the Early Cretaceous forearc plutons within the belt, (3) “Friday Creek assemblage” for a transitional mélange unit that contains blocks of the Carpenter Creek complex in a chert–argillite matrix, and (4) “Knik River metamorphic complex” in reference to metamorphic rocks engulfed by Early Jurassic plutons of the Peninsular terrane that represent the roots of the Talkeetna arc. The correlation of the Carpenter Creek metamorphic complex with the Chugach mélange indicates that the trace of the BRF lies ∼1–5 km north of the map trace shown on geologic maps, although, like other segments of the BRF, this boundary is blurred by local complexities within the BRF system. Ductile deformation of the mélange is sufficiently intense that few vestiges of its original mélange fabric exist, suggesting the scarcity of rocks described as mélange in the cores of many orogens may result from misidentification of rocks that have been intensely overprinted by younger, ductile deformation.","http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/full-xml/10.1139/cjes-2015-0046",""

This study provides a historical overview of the racialization of immigrants including immigration policies and shows that the racialization of immigrants has occurred historically but particularly over the past half century as non-Europeans became the primary groups of immigrants in this country. In addition, the study calls for immigration researchers to more fully incorporate race perspectives into the study of immigrants. Furthermore, the study illustrates the need to consider methodological and data approaches to integrate racial matters into the study of immigrants. The article concludes with a discussion of the sociological implications of incorporating race more centrally in the study of immigrants.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2332649214559287",""

In this study, growth and relative organ weights were evaluated along with a residue analysis for aflatoxin B1 in liver tissue collected from broiler chickens consuming dietary aflatoxin (0, 600, 1200, and 1800 µg/kg) both with and without 0.2% of a calcium bentonite clay additive (TX4). After one week, only the combined measure of a broiler productivity index was significantly affected by 1800 µg/kg aflatoxin. However, once birds had consumed treatment diets for two weeks, body weights and relative kidney weights were affected by the lowest concentration. Then, during the third week, body weights, feed conversion, and the productivity index were affected by the 600 µg/kg level. Results also showed that 0.2% TX4 was effective at reducing the accumulation of aflatoxin B1 residues in the liver and improving livability in birds fed aflatoxin. The time required to clear all residues from the liver was less than one week. With evidence that the liver’s ability to process aflatoxin becomes relatively efficient within three weeks, this would imply that an alternative strategy for handling aflatoxin contamination in feed could be to allow a short, punctuated exposure to a higher level, so long as that exposure is followed by at least a week of a withdrawal period on a clean diet free of aflatoxin.","https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6651/7/9/3455/pdf",""

The QM component is the spin-free PES and spin-orbit coupling for each state is represented by a MM-like analytic potential fit to spin-orbit electronic structure calculations. Coupled-cluster single double and perturbative triple excitation (CCSD(T)) calculations are performed to obtain “benchmark” reaction energies without spin-orbit coupling. With zero-point energies removed, the “experimental” reaction energy is 44 ± 5 meV for HBr+(2Π3/2) + CO2 → Br(2P3/2) + HOCO+, while the CCSD(T) value with spin-orbit effects included is 87 meV.

The results of different electronic structure methods were compared with those obtained with CCSD(T), and UMP2/cc-pVTZ/PP was found to be a practical and accurate QM method to use in QM/MM direct dynamics simulations. The spin-orbit coupling calculations show that the spin-free QM PES gives a quite good representation of the shape of the PES originated by 2Π3/2HBr+. This is also the case for the reactant region of the PES for 2Π1/2 HBr+, but spin-orbit coupling effects are important for the exit-channel region of this PES.

Previously, we showed that mice homozygous for an insertion in the Igf1 allele have reduced levels of IGF-I, are smaller, and have an extension of maximum lifespan. Here, we tested whether this specific reduction of IGF-I alters glucose metabolism both on normal rodent chow and in response to high-fat feeding. We found that female IGF-I-deficient mice were lean on a standard rodent diet but paradoxically displayed an insulin-resistant phenotype. However, these mice gained significantly less weight than normal controls when placed on a high-fat diet. In control animals, insulin response was significantly impaired by high-fat feeding, whereas IGF-I-deficient mice showed a much smaller shift in insulin response after high-fat feeding. Gluconeogenesis was also elevated in the IGF-I-deficient mice relative to controls on both normal and high-fat diet. An analysis of metabolism and respiratory quotient over 24 h indicated that the IGF-I-deficient mice preferentially utilized fatty acids as an energy source when placed on a high-fat diet. These results indicate that reduction in the circulating and tissue IGF-I levels can produce a metabolic phenotype in female mice that increases peripheral insulin resistance but renders animals resistant to the deleterious effects of high-fat feeding.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpendo.00558.2014",""

A prior is constructed through distributions on the number of basis functions and the associated coefficients. We derive a general result on adaptive posterior contraction rates for all smoothness levels of the target function in the true model by constructing an appropriate ‘sieve’ and applying the general theory of posterior contraction rates. We apply this general result on several statistical problems such as density estimation, various nonparametric regressions, classification, spectral density estimation and functional regression. The prior can be viewed as an alternative to the commonly used Gaussian process prior, but properties of the posterior distribution can be analysed by relatively simpler techniques. An interesting approximation property of B‐spline basis expansion established in this paper allows a canonical choice of prior on coefficients in a random series and allows a simple computational approach without using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. A simulation study is conducted to show that the accuracy of the Bayesian estimators based on the random series prior and the Gaussian process prior are comparable. We apply the method on Tecator data using functional regression models.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/sjos.12159",""

In particular, the intensity of continental runoff influenced the flux of bulk organic matter to the sediment. Benthic anoxia appears to have been controlled by the vertical density gradient in the water column associated with continental runoff combined with the advection of basinal water. Anoxic conditions were stronger in proximal (i.e., more shoreward) areas of the Midcontinent Shelf, indicating that anoxia did not develop primarily due to upwelling of nutrient‐rich waters along the southern shelf margin, as previously suggested. Changes in water mass redox conditions not only drove authigenic enrichment of redox‐sensitive trace elements across the basin but also had a strong effect on the spatial distribution of various conodont taxa. Our analysis suggests that the widely accepted depth‐stratification model for the distribution of conodonts is incomplete. Conodont biofacies distributions seem to have been controlled by physicochemical properties of the water mass (e.g., salinity, temperature, nutrients, turbidity, and/or dissolved oxygen levels) that may correspond less directly to water depth. The proximity to terrestrial freshwater influx and the strength of anoxia/euxinia in the subpycnoclinal water mass played significant roles in the spatial and temporal distributions of conodont taxa.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2F2014PA002725",""

Next, we taught infants novel words in these higher and lower knowledge domains and then asked if their subsequent real‐time recognition of these items varied as a function of their category knowledge. While our participants successfully acquired the novel label–object mappings in our task, there were important differences in the way infants recognized these words in real time. Namely, infants showed more robust recognition of high (vs. low) domain knowledge words.

Reports of the occurrence of mycosis fungoides in married couples and families raise the possibility of an environmental trigger for this cancer. Although it has been suggested that CTCL arises from inappropriate T‐cell stimulation, to the authors' knowledge no preventable trigger has been identified to date. METHODS: Using region, zip code, age, sex, and ethnicity, the authors analyzed the demographic data of 1047 patients from Texas who were seen in a CTCL clinic at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center during 2000 through 2012 (the MDACC database) and 1990 patients who were recorded in the population‐based Texas Cancer Registry between 1996 and 2010. Subsequently, data from both databases were cross‐analyzed and compared. RESULTS: The current study findings, based on the MDACC database, documented geographic clustering of patients in 3 communities within the Houston metropolitan area, in which CTCL incidence rates were 5 to 20 times higher than the expected population rate. Analysis of the Texas Cancer Registry database defined the CTCL population rate for the state to be 5.8 cases per million individuals per year (95% confidence interval, 5.5‐6.0 per million individuals per year), thus confirming the observations from the MDACC database and further highlighting additional areas of geographic clustering and regions spared from CTCL in Texas. CONCLUSIONS: The current study documented geographic clustering of CTCL cases in Texas and argued for the existence of yet unknown external causes/triggers for this rare malignancy.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fcncr.29301",""

The development of genotypes capable of maintaining yield and quality under a wide range of conditions is important so that profitability can be maximized. Issues such as declining irrigation capacity and diseases limit production in parts of Texas. Efforts of the Texas AgriLife Peanut Breeding Program are to develop breeding lines with improved yield potential, total sound mature kernels (TSMK), and disease resistance. Cultivar trials were conducted in 2009, 2010, and 2011 to evaluate the performance of the cultivar Tamrun OL11. Trials were established in several different production areas under various field conditions and included the commercial standards Flavor Runner 458 and Tamrun OL07. Yields were similar for Flavor Runner 458 and Tamrun OL07 at 4538 and 4534 kg/ha, respectively; whereas, Tamrun OL11 averaged 4845 kg/ha (P  = 0.02). TSMK plus sound splits (SS) for Tamrun OL11 were 1.3% higher than Flavor Runner 458 and 2.4% higher Tamrun OL07. When comparing cultivars in fields with a history of severe Sclerotinia blight (caused by Sclerotinia minor) yield increases of 1240 and 2229 kg/ha were observed for Tamrun OL11 over Tamrun OL07 and Flavor Runner 458, respectively. Results from these studies illustrate the high yield potential and superior TSMK of Tamrun OL11.","http://meridian.allenpress.com/peanut-science/article-pdf/42/1/11/1855747/0095-3679-42_1_11.pdf",""

Agriculture in this region mainly depends on water from the vast underground Ogallala Aquifer. Due to excess withdrawal and a slow recharge process, groundwater levels are declining in many areas of the aquifer. Recently, regulations have been enacted in the Texas High Plains for restricting the amount of water pumped from the Ogallala Aquifer. In addition to pumping restrictions, conserving water by promoting irrigation systems with high application efficiency is also a priority. We investigated the emitted uniformity and application efficiency of 14 centre‐pivot irrigation systems in the Texas High Plains. Application efficiencies were in the range of 60–70% for mid‐elevation spray application (MESA) systems, 70–80% for low‐elevation spray application (LESA) systems, and greater than 90% for low‐energy precision application (LEPA) systems. Correction of the small number of defective emitters per system would not realize significant water savings. However, water savings could be realized by switching from MESA or LESA to LEPA, assuming the choice of crop allowed it.

Yet, interreligious violence erupts only in some communities but not others. Under what conditions does religious identity become the fault line of communal violence? We argue that informal power-sharing institutions on the communal level are essential in shaping the incentives of potential perpetrators. We provide both qualitative and quantitative evidence for our claim that districts in which informal power-sharing agreements exist are less likely to experience interreligious violence. We conducted interviews with community leaders in 38 Nigerian districts to trace the process by which local power-sharing institutions exert influence on actors’ incentives to engage in religious violence. We complement this with quantitative analyses of a new dataset capturing interreligious violence on a subnational level. The analyses show that the overall degree of interreligious violence is significantly lower in districts with power-sharing than in those without. We also identify two causal mechanisms through which informal power-sharing institutions operate. First, these institutions affect the incentives of elites to appeal for cooperation. We show that the rhetoric of elites in districts with power-sharing is significantly more conciliatory. Second, power-sharing affects the general population’s perception of the interreligious tensions. Individuals living in districts with power-sharing institutions are less likely to experience religious diversity as threatening. Local-level informal power-sharing institutions are therefore an important foundation for communal peace and interreligious cooperation.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0022343315614999",""

The histone deacetylase 6-inhibitor tubacin has been shown to slow the growth of metastatic prostate cancer cells and sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents. However, the proteins histone deacetylase 6 interacts with, and thus its role in cancer cells, remains poorly characterized. Histone deacetylase 6 deacetylase activity has recently been shown to be required for efficient basal autophagic flux. Autophagy is often dysregulated in cancer cells and may confer stress resistance and allow for cell maintenance and a high proliferation rate. Tubacin may therefore slow cancer cell proliferation by decreasing autophagic flux. We characterized the histone deacetylase 6-interacting proteins in LNCaP metastatic prostate cancer cells and found that histone deacetylase 6 interacts with proteins involved in several cellular processes, including autophagy. Based on our interaction screen, we assessed the impact of the histone deacetylase 6-inhibitor tubacin on autophagic flux in two metastatic prostate cancer cell lines and found that tubacin does not influence autophagic flux.

Numerous consortia studies of complex traits have publically released their summary association statistics, which have become an invaluable resource for learning the underlying biology, understanding the genetic architecture, and guiding clinical translations. There is great interest in the field in developing novel statistical methods for analyzing and interpreting results from these genotype‐phenotype association studies. One popular platform for method development and data analysis is R. In order to enable these analyses in R, it is necessary to develop packages that can efficiently query files of summary association statistics, explore the linkage disequilibrium structure between variants, and integrate various bioinformatics databases. The complexity and scale of sequence datasets and databases pose significant computational challenges for method developers. To address these challenges and facilitate method development, we developed the R package SEQMINER for annotating and querying files of sequence variants (e.g., VCF/BCF files) and summary association statistics (e.g., METAL/RAREMETAL files), and for integrating bioinformatics databases. SEQMINER provides an infrastructure where novel methods can be distributed and applied to analyzing sequence datasets in practice. We illustrate the performance of SEQMINER using datasets from the 1000 Genomes Project. We show that SEQMINER is highly efficient and easy to use.

As governing variables, tool geometry, tool wear, machining parameter, work material property, and lubrication conditions have been widely studied to determine their effects on residual stress pattern in machined surface and subsurface. Among those parameters, tool flank wear was seldom fully investigated although tool flank wear, as well as machining speed, has been identified as the most important contributor to residual stress. Especially, tool flank wear becomes more significant due to the poor work thermal property during the high speed machining of titanium Ti-6Al-4V alloy. This study aims to investigate the combined role of tool flank wear and machining speed in developing residual stress in the machining of titanium alloy using finite element method. A microstructure sensitive material model based on Self Consistent Method (SCM) is adopted to incorporate the phase state and its transformations during machining cycle. Critical flank wear land and corresponding machining speeds are identified, beyond which compressive residual stresses are transferred into tensile residual stresses. High machining speeds demonstrate a distinct influence on residual stresses by means of promoting tool flank wear rate.

Women (but not men) who preferred smarter romantic partners showed worse math performance (Studies 1–2), less identification with math (Study 2), and less interest in STEM careers (Study 3) when the goal to be romantically desirable was activated.

Both are associated with a very high risk of mortality. Numerous instances, however, of long‐term survival of children with T13 or T18 have prompted some clinicians to pursue aggressive treatment instead of the traditional approach of palliative care. The purpose of this study is to assess current mortality data for these conditions. This multi‐state, population‐based study examined data obtained from birth defect surveillance programs in nine states on live‐born infants delivered during 1999–2007 with T13 or T18. Information on children's vital status and selected maternal and infant risk factors were obtained using matched birth and death certificates and other data sources. The Kaplan–Meier method and Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate age‐specific survival probabilities and predictors of survival up to age five. There were 693 children with T13 and 1,113 children with T18 identified from the participating states. Among children with T13, 5‐year survival was 9.7%; among children with T18, it was 12.3%. For both trisomies, gestational age was the strongest predictor of mortality. Females and children of non‐Hispanic black mothers had the lowest mortality. Omphalocele and congenital heart defects were associated with an increased risk of death for children with T18 but not T13.

However, a debate has existed since the 1970s concerning whether or not cAMP signaling is essential for glucose alone to stimulate insulin secretion. Here, we report that the first-phase kinetic component of GSIS is cAMP-dependent, as revealed through the use of a novel highly membrane permeable para-acetoxybenzyl (pAB) ester prodrug that is a bioactivatable derivative of the cAMP antagonist adenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate, Rp-isomer (Rp-cAMPS). In dynamic perifusion assays of human or rat islets, a step-wise increase of glucose concentration leads to biphasic insulin secretion, and under these conditions, 8-bromoadenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate, Rp-isomer, 4-acetoxybenzyl ester (Rp-8-Br-cAMPS-pAB) inhibits first-phase GSIS by up to 80%. Surprisingly, second-phase GSIS is inhibited to a much smaller extent (≤20%). Using luciferase, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assays performed in living cells, we validate that Rp-8-Br-cAMPS-pAB does in fact block cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation. Novel effects of Rp-8-Br-cAMPS-pAB to block the activation of cAMP-regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Epac1, Epac2) are also validated using genetically encoded Epac biosensors, and are independently confirmed in an in vitro Rap1 activation assay using Rp-cAMPS and Rp-8-Br-cAMPS. Thus, in addition to revealing the cAMP dependence of first-phase GSIS from human and rat islets, these findings establish a pAB-based chemistry for the synthesis of highly membrane permeable prodrug derivatives of Rp-cAMPS that act with micromolar or even nanomolar potency to inhibit cAMP signaling in living cells.","http://academic.oup.com/mend/article-pdf/29/7/988/8914895/mend0988.pdf",""

The retrospective cohort study examined the records of dental students at Louisiana State University Health Science Center School of Dentistry for the years 1998 to 2008. Only those students who could be categorized into the following four groups were included: 1) those who graduated in the top 10% of their class, 2) those who graduated in the bottom 10% of their class, 3) those who repeated a year of dental school, and 4) those who were dismissed or resigned. The study sample consisted of 176 students: 62 in the first group, 62 in the second group, 25 in the third group, and 27 in the fourth group. Data collected were each student's undergraduate grade point average (GPA); chalk carving score; undergraduate biology, chemistry, physics (BCP) GPA; Dental Admission Test (DAT) Academic Average; Perceptual Ability Test (PAT) score of the DAT; total DAT score; grade in preclinical operative dentistry class; grade in morphology and occlusion class; and dental school GPA at graduation. The results showed that only the undergraduate GPA and BCP GPA were significantly higher for students in the top 10% of their class than for other groups. The only positive correlation involving the chalk carving scores was with the preclinical operative dentistry course grade. This study thus found limited correlations between this institution's admissions criteria and its students’ success in dental school.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fj.0022-0337.2015.79.5.tb05915.x",""

Nanoscale devices are able to be included with Internet. This new communication paradigm, referred to as Internet of Nanothings (IoNT), demands very short-range connections among nanoscale devices. IoNT raises many challenges to realize it. Current network protocols and techniques may not be directly applied to communicate with nanosensors. Due to the very limited capability of nanodevices, the devices must have simple communication and simple medium sharing mechanism in order to collect the data effectively from nanosensors. Moreover, nanosensors may be deployed at organs of the human body, and they may produce large data. In this process, the data transmission from nanosensors to gateway should be controlled from the energy efficiency point of view. In this paper, we propose a wireless nanosensor network (WNSN) at the nanoscale that would be useful for intrabody disease detection. The proposed conceptual network model is based on On-Off Keying (OOK) protocol and TDMA framework. The model assumes hexagonal cell-based nanosensors deployed in cylindrical shape 3D hexagonal pole. We also present in this paper the analysis of the data transmission efficiency, for the various combinations of transmission methods, exploiting hybrid, direct, and multi-hop methods.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1155/2015/176761",""

In part, the age-related reduction in performance is due to a selective loss of muscle fiber mass, but mass-independent effects have also been demonstrated. An important mass-independent determinant of muscle performance is the pattern of expression of isoforms of proteins that participate in muscle contraction (e.g., the troponins). In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that ageing impairs alternative splicing of the pre-mRNA encoding fast skeletal muscle troponin T (TNNT3) in human vastus lateralis muscle. Furthermore, we hypothesized that resistance exercise alone or in combination with consumption of essential amino acids would attenuate age-associated effects on TNNT3 alternative splicing. Our results indicate that ageing negatively affects the pattern of TNNT3 alternative splicing in a manner that correlates quantitatively with age-associated reductions in muscle performance. Interestingly, whereas vastus lateralis TNNT3 alternative splicing was unaffected by a bout of resistance exercise 24 h prior to muscle biopsy, ingestion of a mixture of essential amino acids after resistance exercise resulted in a significant shift in the pattern of TNNT3 splice form expression in both age groups to one predicted to promote greater muscle performance. We conclude that essential amino acid supplementation after resistance exercise may provide a means to reduce impairments in skeletal muscle quality during ageing in humans.","http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/full-xml/10.1139/apnm-2014-0568",""

This is particularly important in contexts where the user base may be non-IT professionals—i.e., the users may vary substantially in their basic IT knowledge. We draw on psychology to argue that in situations where there is a wide variance in actual IT knowledge, there will often exist a U-shaped relationship between actual and self-perceived IT knowledge such that the least knowledgeable believe themselves to be highly knowledgeable. We then draw on individual-level adoption theories to argue that users with high self-perceived IT knowledge will be more likely to adopt new technologies and do so faster.

The dissociation of the symbiosis between reef-building corals and their algal symbiont, or coral bleaching, has been linked to increased sea surface temperatures. Coral bleaching has significant impacts on corals, including an increase in disease outbreaks that can permanently change the entire reef ecosystem. Yet, little is known about the impacts of coral bleaching on the coral immune system. In this study, whole transcriptome analysis of the coral holobiont and each of the associate components (i.e. coral host, algal symbiont and other associated microorganisms) was used to determine changes in gene expression in corals affected by a natural bleaching event as well as during the recovery phase. The main findings include evidence that the coral holobiont and the coral host have different responses to bleaching, and the host immune system appears suppressed even a year after a bleaching event. These results support the hypothesis that coral bleaching changes the expression of innate immune genes of corals, and these effects can last even after recovery of symbiont populations. Research on the role of immunity on coral's resistance to stressors can help make informed predictions on the future of corals and coral reefs.","https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsos.140214",""

We analyzed bacteria from whole-population samples frozen every 500 generations through 20,000 generations for one well-studied population, called Ara−1. By tracking 42 known mutations in these samples, we reconstructed the history of this population’s genotypic evolution over this period. The evolutionary dynamics of Ara−1 show strong evidence of selective sweeps as well as clonal interference between competing lineages bearing different beneficial mutations. In some cases, sets of several mutations approached fixation simultaneously, often conveying no information about their order of origination; we present several possible explanations for the existence of these mutational cohorts. Against a backdrop of rapid selective sweeps both earlier and later, two genetically diverged clades coexisted for &gt;6000 generations before one went extinct. In that time, many additional mutations arose in the clade that eventually prevailed. We show that the clades evolved a frequency-dependent interaction, which prevented the immediate competitive exclusion of either clade, but which collapsed as beneficial mutations accumulated in the clade that prevailed. Clonal interference and frequency dependence can occur even in the simplest microbial populations. Furthermore, frequency dependence may generate dynamics that extend the period of coexistence that would otherwise be sustained by clonal interference alone.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/200/2/619/49455419/genetics0619.pdf",""

Several trapping techniques are used in the study of lesser prairie-chickens, despite lack of knowledge of trap injury caused by the various methods. From 2006 to 2012, we captured 217, 40, and 144 lesser prairie-chickens Tympanuchus pallidicinctus using walk-in funnel traps, rocket nets, and drop nets, respectively, in New Mexico and Texas, to assess the effects of capture technique on injury and survival of the species. We monitored radiotagged, injured lesser prairie-chickens 7–65 d postcapture to assess survival rates of injured individuals. Injuries occurred disproportionately among trap type, injury type, and sex. The predominant injuries were superficial cuts to the extremities of males captured in walk-in funnel traps. However, we observed no mortalities due to trapping, postcapture survival rates of injured birds did not vary across trap types, and the daily survival probability of an injured and uninjured bird was ≥99%. Frequency and intensity of injuries in walk-in funnel traps are due to the passive nature of these traps (researcher cannot select specific individuals for capture) and incidental capture of individuals not needed for research. Comparatively, rocket nets and drop nets allow observers to target birds for capture and require immediate removal of captured individuals from the trap. Based on our results, trap injuries would be reduced if researchers monitor and immediately remove birds from walk-in funnels before they injure themselves; move traps to target specific birds and reduce recaptures; limit the number of consecutive trapping days on a lek; and use proper netting techniques that incorporate quick, efficient, trained handling procedures.","https://meridian.allenpress.com/jfwm/article-pdf/6/2/318/2940905/032015-jfwm-022.pdf",""

Despite being well studied continentally, connectivity of sandhill crane Grus canadensis populations throughout the western portion of their North American range remains poorly described. Our objectives were to 1) use global positioning system satellite transmitter terminals to identify summer distributions for the Lower Colorado River Valley Population of greater sandhill cranes Grus canadensis tabida and 2) determine whether intermingling occurs among any of the western greater sandhill crane populations: Rocky Mountain Population, Lower Colorado River Valley Population, and Central Valley Population. Capture and marking occurred during winter and summer on private lands in California and Idaho as well as on two National Wildlife Refuges: Cibola and Sonny Bono Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuges. A majority of marked greater sandhill cranes summered in what is established Lower Colorado River Valley Population breeding areas in northeastern Nevada and southwestern Idaho. A handful of greater sandhill cranes summered outside of traditional breeding areas in west-central Idaho around Cascade Reservoir near Donnelly and Cascade, Idaho. For example, a greater sandhill crane colt captured near Donnelly in July 2014 survived to winter migration and moved south to areas associated with the Rocky Mountain Population. The integration of the greater sandhill crane colt captured near Donnelly provides the first evidence of potential intermingling between the Lower Colorado River Population and Rocky Mountain Population. We suggest continued marking and banding efforts of all three western populations of greater sandhill cranes will accurately delineate population boundaries and connectivity and inform management decisions for the three populations.","http://meridian.allenpress.com/jfwm/article-pdf/7/1/141/2908150/042015-jfwm-036.pdf",""

Here we found gemcitabine treatment induced NOX-derived ROS generation through the increase of p22-phox expression via NF-kappaB activation. As ROS levels increased, nuclear translocation of Nrf2 stimulated transcription of cytoprotective antioxidant genes, specially, those encoding enzymes that catalyze glutathione production to reduce elevated ROS as one of intrinsic resistance counter measures. RNAi depletion of Nrf2 enhanced the sensitivity to gemcitabine in multiple PDAC cells. The addition of beta–phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) inhibited the ROS detoxification process by reducing glutathione levels; this, in turn, increased the efficacy of gemcitabine in vitro and in vivo. Thus, our results provide novel pre-clinical knowledge in pancreatic cancer chemoresistance, and combination with a redoxmodulating compound to deplete antioxidants can overcome intrinsic gemcitabine resistance. Our study suggests that a redox-mediated pathway that contributes to the intrinsic resistance of PDAC to gemcitabine and provides a basis for developing strategies to preferentially kill PDAC cells through ROS-mediated mechanism. The combination of gemcitabine and PEITC demonstrates a coordinated and selective cytotoxic effect against pancreatic cancer cells and a new avenue for further clinical studies of this deadly disease. Thus, this combination strategy could prove valuable as a cancer treatment.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/75/13_Supplement/A105/599518/Abstract-A105-Mechanisms-of-overcoming-intrinsic",""

This article argues that the school-to-prison pipeline has its origins in social transformation of work and its distribution of rewards, racialized and gendered punishment practices that are differentially employed to curtail recalcitrant behavior, and differences in the ecological contexts of childhood development. The article begins by reviewing research on race and class inequalities in penal and educational institutions. Next, it presents new estimates of juvenile incarceration rates to show how adolescent incapacitation mirrors adult incarceration rates. Finally, policy prescriptions to disrupt, redress, and retard the school-to-prison pipeline are discussed.","https://academic.oup.com/edited-volume/chapter-pdf/44420207/book_41333_section_352356436.ag.pdf",""

CO2injected in carbonate reservoirs, such as those found in the Middle East, can react with ions present in the brine and the solid calcite in the carbonate rocks. These geochemical reactions impact the overall mole numbers and in some extreme cases, even the number of phases at equilibrium impacting oil recovery predictions obtained from compositional simulations. Hence, it is important to study the impact of geochemical reactions on a real reservoir fluid mixture during CO2injection. In this study, the Gibbs free energy function is utilized to integrate phase behavior computations and geochemical reactions to find equilibrium compositions. The Gibbs free energy minimization method using elemental balance constraint is used to obtain equilibrium compositions arising at phase and chemical equilibrium. The solid phase is assumed to be calcite, the hydrocarbon phases are characterized using the Peng-Robinson (PR) Equation of State (EOS), and the aqueous phase components are described using the Pitzer activity coefficient model. The binary interaction parameters for the EOS and the activity coefficient model are obtained using experimental data.","http://onepetro.org/SPEATCE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/175030-MS/1381554/spe-175030-ms.pdf",""

Involvement of inflammatory pathways has been proposed as one of the mechanisms involved. Serum response factor (SRF), a transcription factor, regulates cell development, differentiation and proliferation. Early growth response‐1 (Egr‐1), a nuclear protein, functions as a transcriptional regulator and activates the transcription of several hundred genes. This study explored regulatory influence of SRF on Egr‐1‐dependent signaling in acrolein‐mediated inflammatory responses. Male sprague‐dawley rats (8 weeks old) were exposed to 2 mg/kg/day of acrolein (gavage, 1 week) alone or in combination with rosiglitazone (ROZ, 10 mg/kg/day, gavages, 1 week) or clofibrate (CLO, 250 mg/kg/day, i.p. 1 week). At the end of the treatment period isoprostane level was measured in urine. Changes in the expression of SRF and Egr‐1 proteins in kidney homogenate were determined by western blot. Our results indicated increased generation of ROS in rats treated with acrolein with a reduction after treatment with ROZ andCLO. There was a significant increase in SRF, and Egr‐1 protein expression (~2‐fold and 1.8 fold) in acrolein treated rats compared to the control which was attenuated in presence of CLO and ROZ (52% and 45%; p<0.05). Acrolein treatment significantly reduced TAS expression and only ROZ treatment improved TAS expression. Treatment with CCG‐1423 (SRF inhibitor, 0.03 mg/kg/day, i.p. 1 week) improved TAS expression and reduced SRF and Egr‐1 protein expression. Our results indicate that acrolein up‐regulation of Egr‐1 might be SRF dependent.","",""

Our approach could also be effectively used for analyzing AVO anomalies with increased resolution compared with AB semblance.

SF has been reported to stimulate autophagy, and modulation of autophagy has been proposed to influence SF cytotoxicity; however, no conclusions about autophagy can be drawn without assessing autophagic flux, which has not been characterized in prostate cancer cells following SF treatment. Methods and results: We conducted an investigation to assess the impact of SF on autophagic flux in two metastatic prostate cancer cell lines at a concentration shown to decrease metastasis in vivo. Autophagic flux was assessed by multiple autophagy related proteins and substrates. We found that SF can stimulate autophagic flux and cell death only at high concentrations, above what has been observed in vivo. Conclusion: These results suggest that SF does not directly stimulate autophagy or cell death in metastatic prostate cancer cells under physiologically relevant conditions, but instead supports the involvement of in vivo factors as important effectors of SF‐mediated prostate cancer suppression.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fmnfr.201500283",""

However, uncertainties in the streamflow forecasts pose significant challenges in their utilization in real‐time operations. In this study, we systematically decompose various sources of errors in developing seasonal streamflow forecasts from two Land Surface Models (LSMs) (Noah3.2 and CLM2), which are forced with downscaled and disaggregated climate forecasts. In particular, the study quantifies the relative contributions of the sources of errors from LSMs, climate forecasts, and downscaling/disaggregation techniques in developing seasonal streamflow forecast. For this purpose, three month ahead seasonal precipitation forecasts from the ECHAM4.5 general circulation model (GCM) were statistically downscaled from 2.8° to 1/8° spatial resolution using principal component regression (PCR) and then temporally disaggregated from monthly to daily time step using kernel‐nearest neighbor (K‐NN) approach. For other climatic forcings, excluding precipitation, we considered the North American Land Data Assimilation System version 2 (NLDAS‐2) hourly climatology over the years 1979 to 2010. Then the selected LSMs were forced with precipitation forecasts and NLDAS‐2 hourly climatology to develop retrospective seasonal streamflow forecasts over a period of 20 years (1991–2010). Finally, the performance of LSMs in forecasting streamflow under different schemes was analyzed to quantify the relative contribution of various sources of errors in developing seasonal streamflow forecast. Our results indicate that the most dominant source of errors during winter and fall seasons is the errors due to ECHAM4.5 precipitation forecasts, while temporal disaggregation scheme contributes to maximum errors during summer season.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/2015JD023687",""

Although much is known about regional pulvinar structural anatomy, relatively little is known about pulvinar functional anatomy in humans. Cooccurrence of experimentally induced brain activity is a traditional metric used to establish interregional brain connectivity and forms the foundation of functional neuroimaging connectivity analyses. Because functional neuroimaging studies report task‐related coactivations within a standardized space, meta‐analysis of many whole‐brain studies can define the brain's interregional coactivation across many tasks. Such an analysis can also detect and define variations in functional coactivations within a particular region. Here we use coactivation profiles reported in ∼ 7,700 functional neuroimaging studies to parcellate and define the pulvinar's functional anatomy. Parcellation of the pulvinar's coactivation profile identified five clusters per pulvinar of distinct functional coactivation. These clusters showed a high degree of symmetry across hemispheres and correspondence with the human pulvinar's cytoarchitecture. We investigated the functional coactivation profiles of each resultant pulvinar cluster with meta‐analytic methods. By referencing existent neuroimaging and lesion‐deficit literature, these profiles make a case for regional pulvinar specialization within the larger human attention‐controlling network. Reference to this literature also informs specific hypotheses that can be tested in subsequent studies in healthy and clinical populations.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fhbm.22781",""

A stream in this region, Richland Creek incises into banks comprised of three stratigraphic layers associated with historic land use: pre‐European settlement, early European agriculture and development, and water‐powered milldam operation. This study aims to identify the bank processes along a reach of Richland Creek that is eroding towards its pre‐disturbance elevation. The volume of material that has eroded along this stream since the milldam breached was calculated by differencing a reconstructed surface of the pond bed and an aerial lidar digital terrain model (DTM). Immediately downstream from the study reach, the channel is floored by bedrock and immediately upstream the rate of channel erosion approximately doubled along the longitudinal profile of Richland Creek, which indicate that the study reach spans the transition from a channel dominated by vertical incision in the upstream direction to horizontal widening in the downstream direction.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fesp.3753",""

The use of renewable and biodegradable inputs for growing aesthetically pleasing and healthy plants could potentially improve the economic, environmental, and social sustainability of current production systems. However, costs for production components to integrate sustainable practices into established systems have not been fully explored to date. Our objectives were to determine the economic costs of commercial production systems using alternative containers in aboveground nursery systems. We determined the cost of production (COP) budgets for two woody plant species grown in several locations across the United States. Plants were grown in plastic pots and various alternative pots made from wood pulp (WP), fabric (FB), keratin (KT), and coconut fiber (coir). Cost of production inputs for aboveground nursery systems included the plant itself (liner), liner shipping costs, pot, pot shipping costs, substrate, substrate shipping costs, municipal water, and labor. Our results show that the main difference in the COP is the price of the pot. Although alternative containers could potentially increase water demands, water is currently an insignificant cost in relation to the entire production process. Use of alternative containers could reduce the carbon, water, and chemical footprints of nurseries and greenhouses; however, the cost of alternative containers must become more competitive with plastic to make them an acceptable routine choice for commercial growers.","https://journals.ashs.org/downloadpdf/journals/horttech/25/1/article-p17.xml",""

Methods: Validity and reliability of the Visual Impairment Scale of Service Intensity of Texas (VISSIT) were evaluated using a mixed-methods survey research design. Participants used the VISSIT to determine services for at least one student and then completed an electronic survey regarding the use of the tool. Results: Twenty-five participants completed at least one VISSIT and completed the electronic survey. Social validity was supported by 92% of the participants stating that the tool was easy to use as a way to determine service time and was also supported by 96% of the participants stating that they would use the VISSIT for determining the type and amount of service recommended for their students. Consequential validity was supported by 71% of the participants stating that the tool's results matched their professional judgment regarding student need and recommended service time and was also supported by 75% of the participants stating that the tool's results directly translated into type and amount of service they would recommend. Internal consistency reliability was demonstrated by the result of a factor analysis of Cronbach's Alpha statistic of .747 for the entire set of VISSIT items. Discussion: The results demonstrate that the VISSIT is a moderately valid and reliable tool for helping teachers of students with visual impairments determine the type and amount of visual impairment services based on individual student need. Implications for practitioners: The VISSIT is a tool that itinerant teachers of students with visual impairments can use to determine the appropriate amount of service for all students on their caseloads and offers a more objective way to recommend service intensity based on student need.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0145482X1510900602",""

One of the most vulnerable populations with disabilities in terms of college and career readiness is students with emotional disorders (ED). A considerable percentage of students with ED encounter unfavorable academic and long-term outcomes, often due to reading difficulties and behavioral variables that impede learning. To date, the impact of rising expectations in reading on the education of students with ED has been absent from this conversation about CCSS. In this article, we consider the implications of new reading expectations in the critical period of Grades 6 through 12 for students with ED. First, we summarize grade-level expectations of the standards. We next describe the characteristics and underachievement of students with ED. We then evaluate challenges in meeting the expectations based on extant research and provide recommendations for practice based on the intervention literature. We conclude by prioritizing a research and policy agenda that advocates for increasing the likelihood of success in reading for students with ED in middle school and high school.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1044207315604365",""

Using data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) between 2008 and 2012, the current study examined the prevalence and possible heterogeneity of substance use among serious violent offenders in the United States. Three latent classes were discovered: Class 1 (61.18% of sample) who displayed limited substance use morbidity, Class 2 (28.17% of sample) who displayed comorbid alcohol and marijuana use disorders, and Class 3 (10.65% of sample) who displayed polydrug abuse/dependence and severe criminal careers. Additional results indicated that the most serious violent offenders have substance use problems that appear amenable to treatment; however, the most antisocial violent offenders also have the most severe drug problems.

After summarizing recent field and experimental studies on mental health evaluations by forensic experts, we conclude that working for one side in an adversarial case causes some experts' opinions to drift toward the party retaining their services, even on ostensibly objective instruments and procedures. We call this process adversarial allegiance. The mechanisms that underlie adversarial allegiance among forensic experts are likely similar to the unconscious heuristics and cognitive biases that compromise judgment in a variety of other settings, but these will require further study to understand, and ultimately reduce, adversarial allegiance.","https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-120814-121714",""

Here, we examined the impact of PTEN alterations on the response to treatment with a FAK inhibitor (GSK2256098). In vitro and in vivo therapeutic experiments were carried out using PTEN-mutated and PTEN-wild-type models of uterine cancer alone and in combination with chemotherapy. Treatment with GSK2256098 resulted in greater inhibition of pFAKY397 in PTEN-mutated (Ishikawa) than in PTEN-wild-type (Hec1A) cells. Ishikawa cells were more sensitive to GSK2256098 than the treated Hec1A cells. Ishikawa cells were transfected with a wild-type PTEN construct and pFAKY397 expression was unchanged after treatment with GSK2256098. Decreased cell viability and enhanced sensitivity to chemotherapy (paclitaxel and topotecan) in combination with GSK2256098 was observed in Ishikawa cells as compared with Hec1a cells. In the Ishikawa orthoptopic murine model, treatment with GSK2256098 resulted in lower tumor weights and fewer metastases than mice inoculated with Hec1A cells. Tumors treated with GSK2256098 had lower microvessel density (CD31), less cellular proliferation (Ki67), and higher apoptosis (TUNEL) rates in the Ishikawa model when compared with the Hec1a model. From a large cohort of evaluable patients, increased FAK and pFAKY397 expression levels were significantly related to poor overall survival. Moreover, PTEN levels were inversely related to pFAKY397 expression. These preclinical data demonstrate that PTEN-mutated uterine cancer responds better to FAK inhibition than does PTEN wild-type cancer. Therefore, PTEN could be a biomarker for predicting response to FAK-targeted therapy during clinical development.

We investigated the prevalence of metabolic toxicities, their management, and impact on outcome. Methods.: The temsirolimus dose was 25 mg or 37.5 mg i.v. weekly with escalating doses of cixutumumab (3, 5, or 6 mg/kg i.v. weekly). No patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia at baseline were eligible until the expansion cohort. We assessed metabolic derangements in our patient cohort, their management, and their association with tumor shrinkage, time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS). Results.: Of the 57 patients analyzed, hyperglycemia was seen in 36 (63%) (grade 1–2: 33 [58%]; grade 3–4: 3 [5%]). The median blood sugar level (fasting and nonfasting) across cohorts was 149 mg/dL (upper limit of normal: 110 mg/dL). No patient developed diabetic ketoacidosis or nonketotic hyperosmolar coma or pancreatitis during treatment. Median maximum triglyceride, cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein levels achieved were 247 mg/dL (range: 65–702 mg/dL), 243 mg/dL (range: 103–424 mg/dL), and 153 mg/dL (range 50–375 mg/dL), respectively. Higher glucose levels were associated with more RECIST tumor shrinkage (r = −.30 [95% confidence interval: −.52, −.03; p = .03]). There was no association between metabolic toxicities of the mTOR and IGF-1R combination and TTP or OS. Conclusion.: The combination of temsirolimus and cixutumumab was safe and resulted in manageable metabolic toxicities. More tumor shrinkage was seen in patients who developed these adverse events. Although perhaps limited by the small number of patients, no significant association was discerned between hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, or hypercholesterolemia and TTP or OS. Implications for Practice:: Results of this study show that the combination of temsirolimus and cixutumumab is safe. The most common side effects, hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia, are tolerable and manageable. This combination of therapies should not be withheld from diabetic patients and patients with high cholesterol levels. Collaboration between oncologist and endocrinologist allows for individualized treatment and better control of these adverse events, with few dose interruptions and reductions. Supportive care and close monitoring is needed. Those patients who develop hyperglycemia or hypercholesterolemia may benefit more from the drug.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1634/theoncologist.2015-0065",""

The microwave frequency-, power-, and temperature-dependent ESR spectra coupled with computer-aided simulations reveal four distinct magnetic defect centers. In bituminous- and anthracite-derived GQDs, we have identified two of them as intrinsic carbon-centered magnetic defect centers (a broad signal of peak to peak width = 697 (10−4 T), g = 2.0023; and a narrow signal of peak to peak width = 60 (10−4 T), g = 2.003). The third defect center is Mn2+ (6S5/2, 3d5) (signal width = 61 (10−4 T), g = 2.0023, Aiso = 93(10−4 T)), and the fourth defect is identified as Cu2+ (2D5/2, 3d9) (g⊥ = 2.048 and g‖ = 2.279), previously undetected. Coke-derived and non-coal derived GQDs show Mn2+ and two-carbon related signals, and no Cu2+ signal. The extrinsic impurities most likely originate from the starting coal. Furthermore, Raman, photoluminescence, and ESR measurements detected no noticeable changes in the properties of the bituminous GQDs after one year. This study highlights the importance of employing high frequency ESR spectroscopy in identifying the (magnetic) defects, which are roadblocks for spin relaxation times of graphene-based materials. These defects would not have been possible to probe by other spin transport measurements.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.4936204/13465271/212402_1_online.pdf",""

METHODS: Gemcitabine was administered on days 1, 8, 22, 29, 43, and 50 with EBRT (50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks). The gemcitabine MTD was determined with a toxicity severity weight method (TSWM) incorporating 6 toxicity types. The TSWM is a Bayesian procedure that choses each cohort's dose to have a posterior mean total toxicity burden closest to a predetermined clinician‐defined target. Clinicopathologic and outcome data were also collected. RESULTS: Thirty‐six patients completed the study. According to the TSWM, the gemcitabine MTD was 700 mg/m CONCLUSIONS: The TSWM combines data from qualitatively different toxicities and can be used to determine the MTD for a drug given as part of a multimodality treatment. Neoadjuvant gemcitabine plus radiation therapy is feasible and safe in patients with high‐risk extremity and trunk STS. Major pathologic responses can be achieved, and after complete resection, long‐term clinical outcomes are encouraging.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fcncr.29544",""

This RdDM activity is often considered a mechanism for transcriptional silencing of transposons. However, many of the RdDM targets in the maize genome are located near genes or regulatory elements. We find that the regions of elevated CHH methylation, termed mCHH islands, are the boundaries between highly methylated (CG, CHG), silenced chromatin and more active chromatin. Analysis of RdDM mutants suggests that the function of the boundary is to promote and reinforce silencing of the transposable elements located near genes rather than to protect the euchromatic state of the genes.","http://www.pnas.org/syndication/doi/10.1073/pnas.1514680112",""

While the role of Ω in addressing static (strong) correlation problem has been addressed in numerous previous studies, the usefulness of seniority number in describing weak (dynamic) correlation has not been investigated in a systematic way. Thus, the overall objective in the present work is to investigate the role of Ω in addressing also dynamic electron correlation in addition to the static correlation. Two systematic CI truncation strategies are compared beyond minimal basis sets and full valence active spaces. One approach is based on the seniority number (defined as the total number of singly occupied orbitals in a determinant) and another is based on an excitation-level limitation. In addition, molecular orbitals are energy-optimized using multiconfigurational-self-consistent-field procedure for all these wave functions. The test cases include the symmetric dissociation of water (6-31G), N2 (6-31G), C2 (6-31G), and Be2 (cc-pVTZ). We find that the potential energy profile for H2O dissociation can be reasonably well described using only the Ω = 0 sector of the CI wave function. For the Be2 case, we show that the full CI potential energy curve (cc-pVTZ) is almost exactly reproduced using either Ω-based (including configurations having up to Ω = 2 in the virtual-orbital-space) or excitation-based (up to single-plus-double-substitutions) selection methods, both out of a full-valence-reference function. Finally, in dissociation cases of N2 and C2, we shall also consider novel hybrid wave functions obtained by a union of a set of CI configurations representing the full valence space and a set of CI configurations where seniority-number restriction is imposed for a complete set (full-valence-space and virtual) of correlated molecular orbitals, simultaneously. We discuss the usefulness of the seniority number concept in addressing both static and dynamic electron correlation problems along dissociation paths.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.4929904/15500601/094105_1_online.pdf",""

The focus of disagreement centers largely on paleowater depth and the prevalence of anoxia/euxinia. The issues of paleodepth and water column conditions are important for prediction of lateral variations in source quality within a basin because the viability of a hydrocarbon play depends on a thorough understanding of the distribution of source rock quality and depositional environments. We used inorganic geochemical data from the Middle Devonian Marcellus Shale in the Appalachian Basin to illustrate interpretive strategies that provided constraints on conditions during deposition. Source evaluation typically relies on the analysis and interpretation of organic geochemical indicators, potentially also providing evidence of the degree of thermal maturity and conditions of the preservation of the organic matter. The Marcellus Formation is thermally mature, making the evaluation of the organic-carbon fraction for geologic interpretation inadequate. Because most labile organic matter has largely been destroyed in the Marcellus Formation, analysis of inorganic elements may be used as an alternative interpretative technique. Several inorganic elements have been correlated to varying depositional settings, allowing for their use as proxies for understanding the paleodepositional environments of formations. A high-resolution geochemical data set has been constructed for the Union Springs Member along a transect of cores from proximal to distal in the Appalachian Basin in central Pennsylvania using major, minor, and trace elemental data. Our results suggested that during deposition, the sediment-water interface, and a portion of the water column, was anoxic to euxinic. As deposition continued, euxinia was periodically interrupted by dysoxia and even oxic conditions, and a greater influx of clastic material occurred. Such variations were likely related to fluctuations in water depth and progradation of deltaic complexes from the eastern margin of the Appalachian Basin.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/INT-2014-0228.1",""

All three participants successfully (a) managed choice responses and access to preferred stimuli and (b) gained postural control (i.e., reducing the problem posture to very low levels). The practical implications of those results are discussed.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0145445515572187",""

We find that the non-magnetic Al3+ ions preferentially replace Fe3+ ions at two of the majority spin sites, 2a and 12k, eliminating their positive contribution to the total magnetization causing the saturation magnetization Ms to be reduced as Al concentration x is increased. Our formation probability analysis further provides the explanation for increased magnetic anisotropy field when the fraction of Al is increased. Although Al3+ ions preferentially occupy the 2a sites at a low temperature, the occupation probability of the 12k site increases with the rise of the temperature. At a typical annealing temperature (&gt;700 °C) Al3+ ions are much more likely to occupy the 12k site than the 2a site. Although this causes the magnetocrystalline anisotropy K1 to be reduced slightly, the reduction in Ms is much more significant. Their combined effect causes the anisotropy field Ha to increase as the fraction of Al is increased, consistent with recent experimental measurements.","http://aip.scitation.org/doi/am-pdf/10.1063/1.4922867",""

IEEE sentence recognition in quiet, stationary, and temporally modulated noise were measured for American English native (EN) listeners, Chinese-native listeners in the United States (CNU), and Chinese-native listeners in China (CNC). Results showed that in general, EN listeners outperformed the two groups of CN listeners in quiet and noise, while CNU listeners had better scores of sentence recognition than CNC listeners. Moreover, at low SNRs, the masking release on sentence recognition from the temporal modulation in noise was greatest for EN listeners, and the smallest for CNC listeners with the CNU listeners in between, while at middle and high SNRs, there was no significant group effect on the masking release, consistent with the findings of English vowel perception.

Researchers observed motorists' speed choices upstream of and adjacent to several combinations of work zone conditions and factors that were used to justify reduced speed limits in Ohio work zones. Researchers also observed motorists' speed choices upstream of and within pilot variable work zone speed zones. Researchers confirmed that motorists reduced their speed only if they clearly perceived a need to do so. Therefore, whenever possible, the first work zone speed limit sign should be installed within view of a work zone condition. In general, the speed reduction downstream of the first nonvariable and variable work zone speed limit signs ranged from 1 to 6 mph and 3 to 11 mph, respectively.

The effect of Kv1 channel blockade was also dependent on age and training status. In arterioles from young sedentary rats, Kv1 blockade had little effect on myogenic constriction, whereas in old sedentary rats Kv1 blockade increased myogenic constriction.

To our knowledge, this relationship has not been evaluated for craniosynostosis, a birth defect characterized by the premature closure of sutures in the skull. We conducted a case‐control study to examine associations between maternal occupational exposure to PAHs and craniosynostosis. Methods: We used data from craniosynostosis cases and control infants in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS) with estimated delivery dates from 1997 to 2002. Industrial hygienists reviewed occupational data from the computer‐assisted telephone interview and assigned a yes/no rating of probable occupational PAH exposure for each job from 1 month before conception through delivery. We used logistic regression to assess the association between occupational exposure to PAHs and craniosynostosis. Results: The prevalence of exposure was 5.3% in case mothers (16/300) and 3.7% in control mothers (107/2,886). We observed a positive association between exposure to PAHs during the 1 month before conception through the third month of pregnancy and craniosynostosis (odds ratio [OR] = 1.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01–3.05) after adjusting for maternal age and maternal education. The number of cases for each craniosynostosis subtype limited subtype analyses to sagittal craniosynostosis; the odds ratio remained similar (OR = 1.76, 95% CI, 0.82–3.75), but was not significant. Conclusion: Our findings support a moderate association between maternal occupational exposure to PAHs and craniosynostosis. Additional work is needed to better characterize susceptibility and the role PAHs may play on specific craniosynostosis subtypes.

In the 2-year study, Cr(VI) exposure was additionally associated with duodenal adenomas and carcinomas in mice only. Subsequent 13-week Cr(VI) studies conducted by another group demonstrated non-neoplastic duodenal lesions in B6C3F1 mice similar to those of the NTP study as well as mild duodenal hyperplasia in F344 rats. Because intestinal lesions in mice are the basis for proposed safety standards for Cr(VI), and the histopathology data are relevant to the mode of action, consistency (an important Hill criterion for causality) was assessed across the aforementioned studies. Two veterinary pathologists applied uniform diagnostic criteria to the duodenal lesions in rats and mice from the 4 repeated-dose studies. Comparable non-neoplastic intestinal lesions were evident in mice and rats from all 4 studies; however, the incidence and severity of intestinal lesions were greater in mice than rats. These findings demonstrate consistency across studies and species and highlight the importance of standardized nomenclature for intestinal pathology. The differences in the severity of non-neoplastic lesions also likely contribute to the differential tumor response.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0192623315611501",""

No mathematical models or system identification processes are used. Second, while most control design methods find one controller, we design a set of controllers satisfying the control objective.

The aim of this study was to evaluate differences in perceptions of incivility between dental faculty and students, between students in different courses of study, and between students in different years of dental study. The study utilized an anonymous electronic survey of all dental faculty and administrators and all dental, dental hygiene, and dental laboratory technology students at a single institution. The survey instrument contained questions concerning perceived uncivil behavior in the classroom and clinical settings. Response rates were 54% for faculty and administrators and ranged from 60% to 97% for students in various years and programs. The results were analyzed based on gender, course of study, year of study, and ethnicity. Significant differences were found regarding perceptions of civil behaviour between faculty and students, male and female students, the year of study, and the course of study. These differences point to the need for further research as well as administrative leadership and faculty development to define guidelines in this area in order to ensure a positive learning environment.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fj.0022-0337.2015.79.1.tb05855.x",""

The understanding of the complexity and the relevance of the neuroregulatory system continues to evolve and as a result raises new questions. The purpose of this review is to articulate results from studies involving experimental models in animals as well as in humans concerning the interaction between the neural mechanisms mediating the hemodynamic responses during exercise. The review describes the arterial baroreflex, the pivotal mechanism controlling mean arterial blood pressure and its fluctuations along with the two main activation mechanisms to exercise: central command (parallel activation of central somatomotor and autonomic descending pathways) and the muscle metaboreflex, the metabolic component of exercise pressor reflex (feedback from ergoreceptors within contracting skeletal muscles). In addition, the role of the cardiopulmonary baroreceptors in modulating the resetting of arterial baroreflex is identified, and the mechanisms in the central nervous system involved with the resetting of baroreflex function during dynamic exercise are also described. Approaching a very relevant clinical condition, the review also presents the concept that the impaired arterial baroreflex function is an integral component of the metaboreflex-mediated exaggerated sympathetic tone in subjects with heart failure. This increased sympathetic activity has a major role in causing the depressed ventricular function observed during submaximal dynamic exercise in these patients. The potential contribution of a metaboreflex arising from respiratory muscles is also considered.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpheart.00077.2015",""

Monolingual and bilingual Latinas endorsed that they were concerned about HIV infection, naming partner infidelity and experiences of forced and coerced sex as primary reasons for their concern.

Observationally it is well known that the flux of these equatorial particles does not simply continue to build up indefinitely, and so a mechanism must necessarily exist that transports these particles from an equatorial pitch angle of 90° down to lower values. However, this mechanism has not been uniquely identified yet. Here we investigate the mechanism of bounce resonance with equatorial noise (or fast magnetosonic waves). A test particle simulation is used to examine the effects of monochromatic magnetosonic waves on the equatorially mirroring energetic electrons, with a special interest in characterizing the effectiveness of bounce resonances.

Most current predictions use a ""bundle of capillary tubes"" concept, which, despite its widespread use, is a severely distorted idealization of natural porous media. In contrast, percolation theory provides a reliable and powerful means to model interconnectivity of disordered networks and porous materials. In this study, we invoke scaling concepts from percolation theory and effective medium theory to predict the saturation dependence of modes of transport — hydraulic and electrical conductivity, air permeability, and gas diffusion — in two disturbed soils. Universal scaling from percolation theory predicts the saturation dependence of air permeability and gas diffusion accurately, even when the percolation threshold for airflow is estimated from the porosity. We also find that the non-universal scaling obtained from the critical path analysis (CPA) of percolation theory can make excellent predictions of hydraulic and electrical conductivity under partially saturated conditions.","https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S0218348X15400046",""

It contains two intervention control functions reflecting efforts to protect susceptible individuals from infected and exposed individuals. For this model, the problem of minimizing the weighted sum of total fractions of infected and exposed individuals and total costs of intervention control constraints at a given time interval is stated. For the analysis of the corresponding optimal controls, the Pontryagin maximum principle is used. According to it, these controls are bang-bang, and are determined using the same switching function. A linear non-autonomous system of differential equations, to which this function satisfies together with its corresponding auxiliary functions, is found. In order to estimate the number of zeroes of the switching function, the matrix of the linear non-autonomous system is transformed to an upper triangular form on the entire time interval and the generalized Rolle’s theorem is applied to the converted system of differential equations. It is found that the optimal controls of the original problem have at most two switchings. This fact allows the reduction of the original complex optimal control problem to the solution of a much simpler problem of conditional minimization of a function of two variables. Results of the numerical solution to this problem and their detailed analysis are provided.","https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/3/4/961/pdf",""

Method: Participants were 288 kindergarten and 1st-grade children with language impairment who were currently receiving school-based language intervention from SLPs. Using hierarchical linear modeling, we partitioned the variance in children's gains in language (i.e., grammar, vocabulary) and literacy (i.e., word decoding) that could be attributed to their individual SLP. Results: Results revealed a significant contribution of individual SLPs to children's gains in grammar, vocabulary, and word decoding. Children's fall language scores and grade were significant predictors of SLPs' contributions, although no SLP-level predictors were significant. Conclusions: The present study makes a first step toward incorporating implementation science and suggests that, for children receiving school-based language intervention, variance in child language and literacy gains in an academic year is at least partially attributable to SLPs. Continued work in this area should examine the possible SLP-level characteristics that may further explicate the relative contributions of SLPs.","http://pubs.asha.org/doi/pdf/10.1044/2015_AJSLP-14-0055",""

Earlier work confirmed this intermediate through trimethylsilyl cyanide trapping under continuous irradiation. We have performed transient absorption spectroscopy to further characterize the mechanism of the ring‐opening reaction. Excitation at 355 nm produced a transient species with an absorption maximum at 445 nm, which we assign to the nitrophenolate unit of the ring‐opened product. The transient absorption decays after ~970 ns with small optical density changes corresponding to a 0.15 quantum yield. Exposure to oxygen did not exhibit a significant deleterious effect on the photoisomerization of the chromeno dye. Time‐dependent density functional theory corroborated spectroscopic assignments of the starting chromeno and the putative ring‐opened intermediate. The excited state behavior of this system parallels the structurally similar oxazine system reported by Raymo and coworkers. The one significant difference is the longer lifetime of the photochemically generated intermediate from chromeno.

Measures of coalition context include community problems, community leadership style, and sense of community. Measures of coalition capacity include the existence of collaborative partnerships and coalition champions. The assessment was completed by 195 members of 9 coalitions in Mexico and 139 members of 7 coalitions in the United States. Psychometric analyses indicate the measures have moderate to strong internal consistency, along with good convergent and discriminant validity in both settings. Results indicate that members of Mexican coalitions perceive substantially more serious community problems, especially with respect to education, law enforcement, and access to alcohol and drugs. Compared to respondents in the United States, Mexican respondents perceive sense of community to be weaker and that prevention efforts are not as valued by the population where the coalitions are located. The Mexican coalitions appear to be operating in a substantially more challenging environment for the prevention of violence and substance use. Their ability to manage these challenges will likely play a large role in determining whether they are successful in their prevention efforts. The context and capacity assessment is a valuable tool that coalitions can use in order to identify and address initial barriers to success.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1090198115596165",""

Yet the specific mechanisms underlying this association are unclear. Smoking-specific avoidance and inflexibility is a construct implicated in multiple manifestations of mood regulation that may underlie smoking behavior. The current study examined the explanatory role of smoking-specific avoidance and inflexibility in terms of the relation between AS and indices of smoking behavior among trauma-exposed smokers. The sample consisted of 217 treatment-seeking adult smokers (44% female; M age = 37.8; SD = 13.2; age range: 18-65 years), who were exposed to at least one lifetime Criterion A trauma event ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [4th ed., text rev.; DSM-IV-TR] Criterion A for trauma exposure). Bootstrap analysis (5,000 re-samples) revealed that AS was indirectly related to the (a) number of cigarettes smoked per day, (b) number of years being a daily smoker, (c) number of failed quit attempts, and (d) heaviness of smoking index among trauma-exposed smokers through its relation with smoking-specific avoidance and inflexibility. These findings provide initial evidence suggesting that smoking-specific avoidance and inflexibility may be an important construct in better understanding AS–smoking relations among trauma-exposed smokers. Future work is needed to explore the extent to which smoking-specific avoidance and inflexibility account for relations between AS and other smoking processes (e.g., withdrawal, cessation outcome) in the context of trauma and smoking comorbidity.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0145445515612402",""

While the long-term neurobehavioral deficits and synaptic perturbations are well documented with chronic use of methamphetamine, cocaine, and nicotine, emerging human and experimental studies also suggest an increasing incidence of neurovascular complications associated with drug abuse. Short- or long-term administration of psychostimulants or nicotine is known to disrupt blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity/function, thus leading to an increased risk of brain edema and neuroinflammation. Various pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed to underlie drug abuse-induced BBB dysfunction suggesting a central and unifying role for oxidative stress in BBB endothelium and perivascular cells. This review discusses drug-specific effects of methamphetamine, cocaine, and tobacco smoking on brain microvascular crisis and provides critical assessment of oxidative stress-dependent molecular pathways focal to the global compromise of BBB. Additionally, given the increased risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) encephalitis in drug abusers, we have summarized the synergistic pathological impact of psychostimulants and HIV infection on BBB integrity with an emphasis on unifying role of endothelial oxidative stress.

When using a fixed dose of one agent in combinations of MTAs, toxicity and efficacy do not necessarily increase with an increasing dose of the other agent. Thus, in dose‐finding trials for combinations of MTAs, interest may lie in identifying the optimal biological dose combinations (OBDCs), defined as the lowest dose combinations (in a certain sense) that are safe and have the highest efficacy level meeting a prespecified target. The limited existing designs for these trials use parametric dose–efficacy and dose–toxicity models. Motivated by a phase I/II clinical trial of a combination of two MTAs in patients with pancreatic, endometrial, or colorectal cancer, we propose Bayesian dose‐finding designs to identify the OBDCs without parametric model assumptions. The proposed approach is based only on partial stochastic ordering assumptions for the effects of the combined MTAs and uses isotonic regression to estimate partially stochastically ordered marginal posterior distributions of the efficacy and toxicity probabilities. We demonstrate that our proposed method appropriately accounts for the partial ordering constraints, including potential plateaus on the dose–response surfaces, and is computationally efficient. We develop a dose‐combination‐finding algorithm to identify the OBDCs. We use simulations to compare the proposed designs with an alternative design based on Bayesian isotonic regression transformation and a design based on parametric change‐point dose–toxicity and dose–efficacy models and demonstrate desirable operating characteristics of the proposed designs. © 2014 The Authors.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fsim.6376",""

Purpose: To determine whether individual or organizational qualities could be identified that were related to registered nurses’ (RNs’) readiness for EBP as measured by their reported EBP barriers, ability, desire, and frequency of behaviors. Methods: A descriptive cross‐sectional survey was used in which a convenience sample of 2,441 nurses within one United States healthcare system completed a modified version of the Information Literacy for Evidence‐Based Nursing questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, Results: RNs employed by facilities designated by the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) as Magnet® or Pathway to Excellence® reported significantly fewer barriers to EBP than those RNs employed by non designated facilities. RNs in Magnet organizations had higher desire for EBP than Pathway to Excellence or non designated facilities. RNs educated at the baccalaureate level or higher reported significantly fewer barriers to EBP than nurses with less education; they also had higher EBP ability, desire, and frequency of behaviors. A predictive model found higher EBP readiness scores among RNs who participated in research, had specialty certifications, and engaged in a clinical career development program. Linking Evidence to Action: Education, research, and certification standards promoted by the Magnet program may provide a nursing workforce that is better prepared for EBP.

Concomitantly, farnesol dose-dependently increased glucose uptake and glucose transport protein 4 (GLUT4) expression without affecting cell viability. Furthermore, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot showed that farnesol increased the mRNA and protein levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a key regulator of adipocyte differentiation, and the mRNA levels of PPARγ-regulated fatty acid-binding protein 4 and adiponectin; in contrast, farnesol downregulated Pref-1 gene, a marker of pre-adipocytes.

In geological porous media, the rate at which chemical reactions (e.g., weathering and dissolution) occur is found to diminish by orders of magnitude with increasing time or distance. The temporal rates of laboratory experiments and field observations differ, and extrapolating from laboratory experiments (in months) to field rates (in millions of years) can lead to order-of-magnitude errors. The reactions are transport-limited, but characterizing them using standard solute transport expressions can yield results in agreement with experiment only if spurious assumptions and parameters are introduced. We previously developed a theory of non-reactive solute transport based on applying critical path analysis to the cluster statistics of percolation. The fractal structure of the clusters can be used to generate solute distributions in both time and space. Solute velocities calculated from the temporal evolution of that distribution have the same time dependence as reaction-rate scaling in a wide range of field studies and laboratory experiments, covering some 10 decades in time. The present theory thus both explains a wide range of experiments, and also predicts changes in the scaling behavior in individual systems with increasing time and/or length scales. No other theory captures these variations in scaling by invoking a single physical mechanism. Because the successfully predicted chemical reactions include known results for silicate weathering rates, our theory provides a framework for understanding changes in the global carbon cycle, including its effects on extinctions, climate change, soil production, and denudation rates. It further provides a basis for understanding the fundamental time scales of hydrology and shallow geochemistry, as well as the basis of industrial agriculture.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/cha/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.4913257/14611326/075403_1_online.pdf",""

Currently, no defined optimal therapeutic strategy exists. The Head Start (HS) regimens have included irradiation‐avoiding strategies in young children with malignant brain tumors using high dose chemotherapy to improve survival and minimize neurocognitive sequelae. Procedure: Three sequential HS studies have been conducted from 1991 to 2009. HS treatment strategy has consisted of maximal surgical resection followed by five cycles of intensive induction followed by consolidation myeloablative chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic stem cell rescue (AuHCR). Irradiation was given following recovery from consolidation based on the patient's age and evidence of residual disease. Results: Twelve children with CPC (median age of 19.5 months) have been treated with HS regimens. Ten patients had >95% resection. Three patients had disseminated disease at diagnosis. Ten patients completed consolidation of whom five are alive, irradiation and disease free at 29, 43, 61, 66 and 89 months from diagnosis. Seven patients experienced tumor recurrence/progression at a median time of 13 months (range 2–43 months). Five patients received irradiation, one for residual disease and four upon progression or recurrence, of whom one is alive at 61 months. The 3‐ and 5‐year progression‐free survivals are 58% and 38% and overall survivals 83% and 62% respectively. Late deaths from disease beyond 5 years were also noted.

Here, we document vegetation change at Barrow and Atqasuk, Alaska, occurring naturally and due to experimental warming over nearly two decades. An examination of plant cover, canopy height, and community indices showed more significant differences between years than due to experimental warming. However, changes with warming were more consistent than changes between years and were cumulative in many cases. Most cases of directional change observed in the control plots over time corresponded with a directional change in response to experimental warming. These included increases in canopy height and decreases in lichen cover. Experimental warming resulted in additional increases in evergreen shrub cover and decreases in diversity and bryophyte cover. This study suggests that the directional changes occurring at the sites are primarily due to warming and indicates that further changes are likely in the next two decades if the regional warming trend continues. These findings provide an example of the utility of coupling in situ experiments with long‐term monitoring to accurately document vegetation change in response to global change and to identify the underlying mechanisms driving observed changes.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ece3.1499",""

The importance of ocean dynamics in the climate response is investigated using additional simulations with a slab ocean version of the model. Precession is found to substantially influence the equatorial Pacific seasonal cycle through both thermodynamic and dynamic mechanisms, while changes in obliquity have only a small effect. In the precession experiments, western equatorial Pacific SSTs respond in a direct thermodynamic manner to changes in insolation, while the eastern equatorial Pacific is first affected by the propagation of thermocline temperature anomalies from the west. These thermocline signals result from zonal wind anomalies associated with changes in the strength of subtropical anticyclones and shifts in the regions of convection in the western equatorial Pacific. The redistribution of heat from these thermocline signals, aided by the direct thermodynamic effect of insolation anomalies, results in large changes to the strength and timing of the eastern equatorial Pacific seasonal cycle. A comparison of 10 CMIP5 mid-Holocene experiments, in which the primary forcing is due to precession, shows that this response is relatively robust across models.

The importance of CL in cardiovascular health is underscored by the life-threatening genetic disorder Barth syndrome (BTHS), which manifests clinically as cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, neutropenia, and growth retardation. BTHS is caused by mutations in the gene encoding tafazzin, the transacylase that carries out the second CL remodeling step. In addition to BTHS, CL is linked to other cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), including cardiomyopathy, atherosclerosis, myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, heart failure, and Tangier disease. The link between CL and CVD may possibly be explained by the physiological roles of CL in pathways that are cardioprotective, including mitochondrial bioenergetics, autophagy/mitophagy, and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. In this review, we focus on the role of CL in the pathogenesis of CVD as well as the molecular mechanisms that may link CL functions to cardiovascular health.","http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2015/891707.pdf",""

However, it is unclear whether ankle position contributes to differences in the passive resistance measured during an SLR assessment. Objective: To examine the influence of ankle position during an SLR on the passive torque, range of motion (ROM), and hamstrings electromyographic (EMG) responses to passive stretch of the posterior hip and thigh muscles. Design: Crossover study. Setting: Research laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 13 healthy volunteers (5 men: age = 24 ± 3 years, height = 178 ± 6 cm, mass = 85 ± 10 kg; 8 women: age = 21 ± 1 years, height = 163 ± 8 cm, mass = 60 ± 6 kg). Intervention(s): Participants performed 6 randomly ordered passive SLR assessments involving 2 assessments at each condition, which included the ankle positioned in DF, PF, and NTRL. All SLRs were performed using an isokinetic dynamometer programmed in passive mode to move the limb toward the head at 5°/s. Main Outcome Measure(s): During each SLR, maximal ROM was determined as the point of discomfort but not pain, as indicated by the participant. Passive torque and EMG amplitude were determined at 4 common joint angles (θ) separated by 5° during the final common 15° of ROM for each participant. Results: Passive torque was greater for the DF condition than the NTRL (P = .008) and PF (P = .03) conditions at θ3 and greater for the DF than NTRL condition (P = .02) at θ4. Maximal ROM was lower for the DF condition than the NTRL (P = .003) and PF (P &lt; .001) conditions. However, we found no differences among conditions for EMG amplitude (P = .86). Conclusions: These findings suggest that performing SLRs with the ankle positioned in DF may elicit greater passive torque and lower ROM than SLRs with the ankle positioned in PF or NTRL. The greater passive torque and lower ROM induced by the DF condition possibly were due to increased tension in the neural structures of the proximal thigh.","http://meridian.allenpress.com/jat/article-pdf/50/5/467/1616892/1062-6050-49_6_04.pdf",""

A 2014 survey of school clinic‐based and community‐based dental patient pools was developed, piloted, and sent to pediatric predoctoral program directors in 57 U.S. dental schools via SurveyMonkey. Two follow‐up contacts were made to increase the response rate. A total of 49 surveys were returned for a response rate of 86%. The responding program directors reported that their programs’ patient pools had declined in number and had changed in character with more diversity and fewer procedures. They attributed the changes to competition, cost, and location of the dental school. The respondents reported that community‐based dental education clinical sites continued to provide additional service experiences for dental students, with contributions varying by the nature of the site. A large number of the respondents felt that their graduates lacked some basic pediatric dentistry clinical skills and were not ready for independent practice with children.

Previous literature has identified flood risk as one significant driver in relocation decisions, but no prior study examines the effect of the National Flood Insurance Program's voluntary program—the Community Rating System (CRS)—on residential location choice. This article fills this gap and tests the hypothesis that flood risk and the CRS‐creditable flood control activities affect residential location choices. We employ a two‐stage sorting model to empirically estimate the effects. In the first stage, individuals’ risk perception and preference heterogeneity for the CRS activities are considered, while mean effects of flood risk and the CRS activities are estimated in the second stage. We then estimate heterogeneous marginal willingness to pay (WTP) for the CRS activities by category. Results show that age, ethnicity and race, educational attainment, and prior exposure to risk explain risk perception. We find significant values for the CRS‐creditable mitigation activities, which provides empirical evidence for the benefits associated with the program. The marginal WTP for an additional credit point earned for public information activities, including hazard disclosure, is found to be the highest. Results also suggest that water amenities dominate flood risk. Thus, high amenity values may increase exposure to flood risk, and flood mitigation projects should be strategized in coastal regions accordingly.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Frisa.12505",""

Methods: Eighty-seven women in sexually active relationships reporting impairments in sexual function completed validated self-report measures and daily online assessments of sexual experiences. Main Outcome Measures: Participants completed the Sexual Satisfaction Scale for Women, the Female Sexual Function Index, and the Measure of Sexual Consequences. Results: Results suggested that decreased physical pleasure and disruption of sexual activity, but not partner responses, statistically mediated the association between sexual function and distress.

We performed an integrative analysis of genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data from early-stage and chemorefractory lung adenocarcinoma and identified three robust subsets of KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma dominated, respectively, by co-occurring genetic events in STK11/LKB1 (the KL subgroup), TP53 (KP), and CDKN2A/B inactivation coupled with low expression of the NKX2-1 (TTF1) transcription factor (KC). We further revealed biologically and therapeutically relevant differences between the subgroups. KC tumors frequently exhibited mucinous histology and suppressed mTORC1 signaling. KL tumors had high rates of KEAP1 mutational inactivation and expressed lower levels of immune markers, including PD-L1. KP tumors demonstrated higher levels of somatic mutations, inflammatory markers, immune checkpoint effector molecules, and improved relapse-free survival. Differences in drug sensitivity patterns were also observed; notably, KL cells showed increased vulnerability to HSP90-inhibitor therapy. This work provides evidence that co-occurring genomic alterations identify subgroups of KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma with distinct biology and therapeutic vulnerabilities.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerdiscovery/article-pdf/5/8/860/1822978/860.pdf",""

Here we explore whether toxins may function alone; i.e., whether a toxin which lacks a corresponding antitoxin (orphan toxin) is physiologically relevant. By focusing on a homologous protein of the membrane-damaging toxin GhoT of the Escherichia coli GhoT/GhoS type V TA system, we found that YdcX (renamed OrtT for orphan toxin related to tetrahydrofolate) is toxic but is not part of TA pair. OrtT is not inactivated by neighboring YdcY (which is demonstrated to be a protein), nor is it inactivated by antitoxin GhoS. Also, OrtT is not inactivated by small RNA upstream or downstream of ortT. Moreover, screening a genomic library did not identify an antitoxin partner for OrtT. OrtT is a protein and its toxicity stems from membrane damage as evidenced by transmission electron microscopy and cell lysis. Furthermore, OrtT reduces cell growth and metabolism in the presence of both antimicrobials trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole; these antimicrobials induce the stringent response by inhibiting tetrahydrofolate synthesis. Therefore, we demonstrate that OrtT acts as an independent toxin to reduce growth during stress related to amino acid and DNA synthesis.","https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6651/7/2/299/pdf",""

Spatial autocorrelation (across census tracts) in unobserved components of vehicle counts by tract and cross-response correlation (both spatial and local–aspatial in nature) was allowed for by the estimation of models of ownership levels (vehicle counts by vehicle type and fuel economy level) with bivariate and trivariate Poisson–lognormal conditional autoregressive models. The presence of high spatial autocorrelations and local cross-response correlations was consistent in all models across all counties studied. Ownership rates for fuel-efficient vehicles were found to rise with household income, resident education levels, and the share of male residents and to fall in the presence of larger household sizes and higher job densities. The average fuel economy of each tract's light-duty vehicles was also analyzed with a spatial error model across all Texas tracts, and this variable was found to depend most on educational attainment levels, median age, income, and household size variables, though all covariates used were statistically significant. If households registering more fuel-efficient vehicles, including hybrid electric vehicles, are also more inclined to purchase plug-in electric vehicles, these findings can assist in spatial planning of charging infrastructure as well as other calculations (such as implications for the revenue from gas tax).","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/2495-06",""

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied participants with T2DM participating in the Health Benefits of Aerobic and Resistance Training in Individuals With Type 2 Diabetes (HART-D) trial who were randomized to a control group or one of three supervised ET groups for 9 months. Fitness response to ET was defined as a change in measured peak absolute oxygen uptake (ΔVO2peak, in liters per minute) from baseline to follow-up. ET participants were classified based on ΔVO2peak into fitness responders (ΔVO2peak ≥5%) and nonresponders (ΔVO2peak &lt;5%), and changes in metabolic profiles were compared across control, fitness responder, and fitness nonresponder groups. RESULTS: A total of 202 participants (mean age 57.1 ± 7.9 years, 63% women) were included. Among the exercise groups (n = 161), there was substantial heterogeneity in ΔVO2peak; 57% had some improvement in CRF (ΔVO2peak &gt;0), with only 36.6% having a ≥5% increase in VO2peak. Both fitness responders and nonresponders (respectively) had significant improvements in hemoglobin A1c and measures of adiposity (ΔHbA1c: −0.26% [95% CI −0.5 to −0.01] and −0.26% [−0.45 to −0.08]; Δwaist circumference: −2.6 cm [−3.7 to −1.5] and −1.8 cm [−2.6 to −1.0]; Δbody fat: −1.07% [−1.5 to −0.62] and −0.75% [−1.09 to −0.41]).

However, due to the requirement of assessing efficacy outcome, which often takes a long period of time to be evaluated, the duration of phase I/II trials is often longer than that of the conventional dose‐finding trials. As a result, phase I/II trials are susceptible to the missing data problem caused by patient dropout, and the missing efficacy outcomes are often nonignorable in the sense that patients who do not experience treatment efficacy are more likely to drop out of the trial. We propose a Bayesian phase I/II trial design to accommodate nonignorable dropouts. We treat toxicity as a binary outcome and efficacy as a time‐to‐event outcome. We model the marginal distribution of toxicity using a logistic regression and jointly model the times to efficacy and dropout using proportional hazard models to adjust for nonignorable dropouts. The correlation between times to efficacy and dropout is modeled using a shared frailty. We propose a two‐stage dose‐finding algorithm to adaptively assign patients to desirable doses. Simulation studies show that the proposed design has desirable operating characteristics. Our design selects the target dose with a high probability and assigns most patients to the target dose.

Elucidating the onset of its subduction is essential to understand the tectonic evolution and seismogenesis of the Costa Rican convergent margin, a typical erosive convergent margin and modern example of a flat‐slab subduction. Initial subduction of the CR has been previously investigated by examining upper plate deformation that was inferred to have resulted from the initial CR subduction. However, little attention has been paid to the extensive sedimentary archives on the CR that could hold important clues to the initial CR subduction. Drilling on the CR during IODP Expedition 344 discovered a pronounced sedimentary hiatus at Site U1381. Here we present paleomagnetic and rock magnetic results of the Cenozoic sedimentary sequences at this site that bracket the hiatus between ca. 9.61 and 1.52 Ma. We also examine the areal extent, timing, and geologic significance of the hiatus by analyzing sedimentary records from five other ODP/IODP sites on CR and Cocos plate. The analyses show that the hiatus appears to be regional and the presence/absence of the sedimentary hiatus at different locations on CR implies a link to the onset of CR shallow subduction, as a result of either bottom current erosion or CR buckling upon its initial collision at the MAT. Records directly from CR thus provide a new window to unraveling the geodynamic evolution of the central American margin.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2F2015GC006058",""

Diabetic (db/db) mice were fed standard (obese-control) or WW isocaloric diets (WW group) for eight weeks; non-obese mice were used as control (lean-control). High-throughput sequencing using the MiSeq platform coupled with freely-available computational tools and quantitative real-time PCR were used to analyze fecal bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences. SCFAs were measured in feces using HPLC-PDA. Results showed no statistical difference in final body weights between the obese-control and the WW group. Almost 9,000 different bacterial species (Operational Taxonomic Units at 97% similarity) were detected in all mice but the bacterial diversity (number of OTUs) did not differ among the treatment groups. The abundance of Ruminococcaceae, a family containing several butyrate-producing bacteria, was found to be higher in obese (median: 6.9%) and WW-supplemented mice (5.6%) compared to lean (2.7%,","https://peerj.com/preprints/1458.pdf",""

We isolated 18 unique transport events over 2 years using observations of Hg and CO at a high‐altitude background site in southwestern China (Mount Ailao Observatory Station) to assess the transport and impact of Hg emissions from biomass burning. The quantity of Hg emission and the source regions were determined using ΔTGM/ΔCO slopes coupled with backward trajectory analysis and CO emission inventories. The slopes of ΔTGM/ΔCO appeared to be a useful chemical indicator for source identification. Industrial emission sources exhibited slopes in the range of 5.1–61.0 × 10","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2F2015JD023525",""
