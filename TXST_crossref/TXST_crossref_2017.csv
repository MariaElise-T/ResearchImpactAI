However, the PDQ subscales (psychosocial and functional disability) have not been assessed independently. This study assesses 1-year surgical outcomes based on the PDQ’s psychosocial and functional disability subscale scores. Methods:: The sample included 130 participants undergoing TKA. Physical and psychosocial measures included the PDQ, Knee Society Score (KSS), Western Ontario McMaster Arthritic Index (WOMAC), and the Short Form-36 Health Inventory (SF-36). Univariate correlations were used to cross-validate all subscales. Multivariate gamma and linear regressions were used to associate PDQ functional and psychosocial disability subscale scores with WOMAC and SF-36, 1 yr after TKA. Results:: Poorer PDQ psychosocial scores were associated with being younger, black or Hispanic, and using Medicaid. Poorer functional disability scores were associated with being younger, female, black or Hispanic, and using Medicaid or without insurance. Multivariate regressions revealed that baseline PDQ psychosocial and functional disability were both significantly associated with 1-year WOMAC total scores and 1-year SF-36 Mental Composite Scores. Conclusions:: The PDQ is useful in predicting 1-year outcomes for patients undergoing TKA. Worse baseline PDQ subscale scores indicated worse quality of life, more pain and stiffness of the joints, as determined by comparative WOMAC and SF-36 scores. Clinical implications from this study suggest screening patients before surgery to identify factors that could hinder recovery time or cause pain or function remission in adults undergoing TKA.","https://journals.lww.com/01337441-201711000-00013",""

Long-term program goals were to improve employee health, well-being, and productivity by focusing on decreasing sedentary behavior, increasing physical activity, improving dietary habits, and reducing stress. An ecological approach was taken to identify levels of influence specific to a university setting: intrapersonal, interpersonal, department/college/division, and university. This framework guided the development of program components and strategies, which were grounded in several health behavior change theories. Input from supervisors and employees was incorporated throughout program development. A 15-week trial run, involving 514 employees, was evaluated to fine-tune services. Participation and feedback were positive, demonstrating that the program was valued. Support from upper administration is evidenced by continued funding.

This type of osteophagia during the winter season is consistent with previously documented behavior of deer gnawing on nonhuman bone, possibly to obtain minerals absent in their diet.

Although extensive research on the mechanism of binding by LARP6 is being performed, very little is known about the physiological conditions that induce the protein to bind to its ligand. A multiple sequence alignment of the LARP6 proteins from vertebrates identified a fully conserved cysteine near the RRM (position C258 in the human protein), and two semi‐conserved cysteines near the C‐terminal region (positions C378 and C490 in human LARP6). To determine if disulfide bonds were present in the protein, the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT), was added during purification. In the presence of DTT, LARP6 eluted from a size exclusion column at a volume that is indicative of an increase in the hydrodynamic radius of the protein.

However, a review of this multidisciplinary literature in generativity revealed several issues—the lack of a cohesive conceptual definition, incompatibility between a conceptual definition and measurements, and varying applications of the model, necessitating a new direction for further conceptual development. Interdisciplinary theoretical insight and empirical evidence collectively suggest that generativity as a targeted midlife task may no longer be sufficient for explaining a life course pattern of generative concerns, commitment, and actions. Given the current trend of population aging, it is especially important to understand better the phenomenon of generativity during the later stages of the life course. The current article offers a new definition for generativity applicable to people across the life course and develops an expanded generativity model, which considers social context and bears practical implications for well‐being. Major implications for future research consist of eliminating the implicit age bias in the conception of generativity and as informed by the pragmatist philosophical perspective, linking generativity to diverse personal experiences and growth rather than mortality.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fsoc4.12533",""

Human-performed audio surveys are inherently biased, and may fail to detect animals when they are present. Automated audio recognition tools offer an alternative mode of observer-free monitoring. Few commercially available platforms for developing these tools exist, and little research has investigated whether these tools are effective at detecting rare vocalization events. We generated a recognizer for detecting the vocalization of the endangered Houston toad Anaxyrus houstonensis using SongScope© bioacoustics software. We developed our recognizer using a large sample of training data that included only the highest quality of recorded audio (i.e., low noise, no interfering vocalizations) divided into small, manageable batches. To track recognizer performance, we generated an independent set of test data through randomly sampling a large population of audio known to possess Houston toad vocalizations. We analyzed training data and test data recursively, using a criterion of zero tolerance for false-negative detections. For each step, we incorporated a new batch of training data into the recognizer. Once we included all training data, we manually verified recognizer performance against one full month (March 2014) of audio taken from a known breeding locality. The recognizer successfully identified 100% of all training data and 97.2% of all test data. However, there is a trade-off between reducing false-negative and increasing false-positive detections, which limited the usefulness of some features of SongScope. Methods of automated detection represent a means by which we may test the efficacy of the manual monitoring techniques currently in use. The ability to search any collection of audio recordings for Houston toad vocalizations has the potential to challenge the paradigms presently placed on monitoring for this species of conservation concern.","http://meridian.allenpress.com/jfwm/article-pdf/9/1/144/2336856/052017-jfwm-047.pdf",""

Because eating patterns established in childhood often track into adulthood, and overweight and obesity are associated with significant health consequences, community interventions to mitigate the development of these conditions should consider the diets of children when they are young. San Marcos, Texas, the fastest growing mid‐sized city in the US for the past three years, is home to a diverse, low‐income population exhibiting rates of childhood overweight and obesity higher than state and national averages. The purpose of this study was to examine diets of a sample of San Marcos preschoolers for potential obesogenic patterns and compare to a national age‐matched sample. Methods: The Healthy Eating Index‐2010 (HEI‐2010) was used to assess the diet quality of a convenience sample of 124 children ages 2–5 who were enrolled in local childcare centers. The HEI‐2010 measures compliance with recommendations of the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Diets with HEI‐2010 scores above 80 are categorized as ‘good’; those with scores between 51 and 80 ‘need improvement’; and scores below 51 are considered ‘poor’. Twenty‐four hour dietary recalls were collected via telephone interviews with parents of preschoolers using Nutrition Data System for Research 2013 (NDSR) software. NDSR output was used to calculate HEI‐2010 scores. HEI‐2010 scores were also calculated for an age‐matched national sample from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey datasets (files DR1TOT_G and DEMO_G from 2009–2010 and DR1TOT_F and DEMO_F from 2011–2012) using the HEI‐2010 macro developed by the National Cancer Institute for use in SAS software. Further analysis included comparison of nutrient intakes to HEI category among the local sample. Results: Mean total HEI‐2010 scores for both the local (62.1) and national (59.9) samples were lower than the optimal score of 100. Total Fruit, Whole Fruit, Dairy, and Total Protein Foods were among the components closest to meeting maximum scores for both samples. Empty Calories was one of the highest‐scoring components among the local but not the national sample. Scores for Greens and Beans and Fatty Acids were among the lowest scores for both samples. Nutrient analysis by HEI‐2010 score category revealed conflicting trends in intakes of vitamins B12 and D among the San Marcos sample. Mean intakes of both vitamins were significantly lower among those in the ‘good’ category than those in the ‘needs improvement’ category. Conclusion: The low HEI‐2010 scores observed among both the local and national sample are concerning. Results of this study should inform nutrition education and training of caregivers of preschool‐aged children in San Marcos.

Health‐related lifestyle behaviors, such as consuming a poor diet and being physically inactive, contribute to the etiology of chronic disease development primarily by facilitating the accumulation of excess body weight. While comprehensive employee wellness programs (EWPs) have been shown to play a significant role in improving health‐related lifestyle behaviors, few, if any, have included a nutrition component. The objective of this study was to include a nutrition component in a pilot EWP, offered free of cost, to employees at a large university in central Texas, and gather employee input by assessing participation in and evaluation of nutrition services. Methods: Prior to the launch of the pilot EWP, a needs assessment survey was administered to all benefits‐eligible university employees (n=3392) and completed by 778. Thereafter, the 15‐ week pilot was launched (enrollment=514). The pilot included health risk appraisals, 25 group exercise classes/week, and biweekly lunchtime health education sessions (with some topics on nutrition). Researchers randomly selected a cohort of 100 employees to participate in a more intensive program from a pool of 194 applicants who expressed interest. The purpose of offering the intensive program was to determine whether additional services would be desirable to participants. To be eligible for the intensive program, enrollees had to express interest and be at moderate or high risk for cardiovascular disease per their health risk appraisal. The final cohort of 100 agreed to participate in the additional services, which included attending health behavior change coaching classes, using the student recreation center at least one time per week, and attending at least one of the 6 hands‐on cooking class. The final study cohort included 20 men (BMI 33.1±10.2 kg·m Results: Of the 100 individuals enrolled, 84 participated in at least one of the services offered in the intensive program. Over the 15‐week pilot, average participation in all events [including 15 health‐behavior coaching sessions, 375 group exercise classes, 10 educational sessions, and 6 cooking classes (with 24 openings per class)] was 24.76. For cooking classes, 73 participated; for lunchtime nutrition education sessions, cumulative participation was157. Per lunchtime nutrition education evaluation feedback, positive changes in nutrition health behavior knowledge and practices were reported, including preparing healthier meals, eating more vegetables, practicing portion control, limiting sugar intake, monitoring calorie intake, and planning menus. Conclusions: Participants enjoyed the cooking classes. After lunchtime education evaluations on a variety of topics, most participants asked for more sessions on nutrition. The most popular request was for sessions on menu planning. The nutrition component seemed significant for participants in the intensive program.","",""

We characterized the epidemiology of microcephaly in Texas during a 5‐year period (2008–2012), prior to the Zika epidemic in the Western hemisphere (2015). The associations of suspected risk factors were compared across four clearly defined case groups. Methods: Data from the Texas Birth Defects Registry were used to calculate the prevalence of congenital microcephaly and crude and adjusted prevalence ratios using Poisson regression. Twelve maternal and infant factors were assessed across case groups, which included total (explained + unexplained), explained (e.g., syndromic), unexplained, and severe unexplained microcephaly (head circumference <3 Results: The birth prevalence for total and total severe microcephaly were 14.7 and 4.8 per 10,000 livebirths, respectively. For explained and unexplained cases, significantly elevated risks were noted for mothers who were older (35+), less educated (≤12 years), diabetic (pre‐pregnancy or gestational), or had a preterm delivery. Unlike explained cases, however, mothers who were non‐White or smoked had an increased risk for unexplained microcephaly. Furthermore, young maternal age (<20), multiparity, and higher BMI reduced the risk for unexplained microcephaly. For severe unexplained cases, the risk profile was similar to that for all unexplained cases—with the exception of null associations noted for diabetes and birth year. Conclusions: We found that risk patterns for microcephaly varied across case groupings. Risk factors included maternal race/ethnicity, age, and smoking during pregnancy. Among severe unexplained cases, notable positive associations were seen among mothers who were non‐Hispanic Black or less educated, while inverse associations were noted for obesity.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fbdr2.1164",""

For the case where no analyzer is used, the ac detector signals can be minimized simultaneously by adjusting the polarization angle of the light incident on the PEM and the PEM tilt angle.

Recently, Texas WIC participants and other low‐income parents have expressed a preference for learning about health through short videos. Video‐based nutrition education may be a useful interface to communicate about complex topics regarding early childhood feeding practices to an audience who identifies as stressed. Per social cognitive theory, parent self‐efficacy regarding feeding children may improve through vicarious learning offered via peer‐generated videos. Currently, there are few such educational videos available to fill this need. Technological interfaces should always take into consideration the preferences of the user. For example, user‐centered design (UCD) of successful smartphone apps is based on the practice of iteratively engaging the intended user during the development process. We aim to employ UCD in the development of educational videos for low‐income parents. The purpose of this study was to begin the UCD process by 1) generating an initial round of videos developed by college students enrolled in a university lifespan nutrition class, with contest based on current scientific consensus regarding appropriate feeding practices for young children, and 2) gathering input from parents of children enrolled in a Head Start/Caminitos research collaborative. Method: Students generated 54 videos. Videos were viewed and scored by students. The research team selected 14 videos (10 English/2 Spanish/2 bilingual) and parents of young children (n = 16) reviewed the videos. A semi‐structured interview guide consisted of 12 questions designed to facilitate 10‐minute interviews conducted in person or via phone. Participant responses were coded and the mated using a 3‐coder model. Results: Parents indicated that they had prior knowledge regarding some video topics, including limiting fruit juice, avoiding choking hazards, eating healthy foods in general, and avoiding unhealthy foods. The most popular videos included rap and singing, based on their entertainment value. Parents also liked videos about complementary feeding using a dog in place of a child, portion sizes, omega 3 fatty acids, healthy snack ideas, the sugar content in beverages, and an animation using paper cutouts explaining the importance of iron in complementary foods. In general, parents trusted the videos because they were viewed through the research collaborative at the school. Notably, many parents were bilingual, and because they spoke English and Spanish at home, preferred the bilingual videos. Conclusions: There was a general positive attitude among parents regarding using videos as a means to learn. The next stage of the project will involve a video contest among parents in the research collaborative to generate videos in English, Spanish, and both languages. These videos will again be subjected to peer review.","",""

These networks have Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems in place to protect them, but they are notorious for producing a high volume of alerts. These alerts must be investigated by cyber analysts to determine whether they are an attack or benign. Unfortunately, there are magnitude more alerts generated than there are cyber analysts to investigate them. This trend is expected to continue into the future creating a need for tools which find optimal assignments of the incoming alerts to analysts in the presence of a strategic adversary. We address this challenge with the four following contributions: (1) a cyber screening game (CSG) model for the cyber network protection domain, (2) an NP-hardness proof for computing the optimal strategy for the defender, (3) an algorithm that finds the optimal allocation of experts to alerts in the CSG, and (4) heuristic improvements for computing allocations in CSGs that accomplishes significant scale-up which we show empirically to closely match the solution quality of the optimal algorithm.","",""

Spent foundry sand not only is sustainable but has supplementary cementitious material (SCM) characteristics. Two series of UHSC mixtures were prepared using a nonreactive and reactive sand (in terms of ASR) to investigate both the impact of a more reactive aggregate and the use of spent foundry sand. Conduction calorimetry was used to monitor the heat of hydration maintained under isothermal conditions, while ASR was investigated using the accelerated mortar bar test (AMBT). Additionally, the compressive strengths were measured for both series of mixtures at 7, 14, and 28 days to confirm high strength requirements. The compressive strengths ranged from 85 MPa (12,345 psi) to 181.78 MPa (26,365 psi). This result demonstrates that a UHSC mixture was produced. The calorimetry results revealed a slight acceleration in the heat of hydration flow curve compared to the control from both aggregates indicating increased hydration reactivity from the addition of foundry waste. The combination of foundry sand and reactive sand was found to increase ASR reactivity with increasing additions of foundry sand up to 30% replacement.","http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/amse/2017/2096808.pdf",""

Design: This review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) standard. Setting: We adopted a logical search process used in two main research databases, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and PubMed (MEDLINE). Four reviewers meticulously screened 151 abstracts to determine relevancy and significance to our research objectives. The final sample in the literature review consisted of 20 articles. Main outcome measures: We looked for improved medical outcomes as the main outcome measure. Results: Our results indicated that telemedicine is highly associated with the reduction in hospitalisations and readmissions (9 of 20 articles, 45%). The other significant attributes most commonly encountered were improved mortality and cost-effectiveness (both 40%) and improved health outcomes (35%). Patient satisfaction occurred the least in the literature, mentioned in only 2 of 20 articles (10%). There was no significant mention of an increase in patient satisfaction because of telemedicine. Conclusions: We concluded that telemedicine is considered to be effective in quality measures such as readmissions, moderately effective in health outcomes, only marginally effective in customer satisfaction. Telemedicine shows promise on an alternative modality of care for cardiovascular disease, but additional exploration should continue to quantify the quality measures.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2054270416681747",""

NB arises from neural crest cells that fail to differentiate. The defected neural crest cells grow indefinitely into tumors that can be surgically removed, however residual NB cells are left behind leading to relapse. The undifferentiated cells can be treated with differentiation therapy which is to force NB cells to differentiate into mature cells leading to growth arrest and apoptosis. The problem with current differentiation treatment is that 13‐ Aims: The goal of our study is to (1) Confirm that CDKN3 is involved in NB differentiation; (2) Demonstrate the function of CDKN3 in cell survival and proliferation regulation; (3) Determine if CDKN3 plays a role in mediating the differentiation‐inducing effects of retinoic acid and MYCN knockdown. Methods: To measure neurite outgrowth NB cells are grown on 96‐well plates then treated using CDKN3 siRNA. Differentiation is confirmed using western blot for NB differentiation markers: growth associated protein 43 (GAP 43), neuron specific enolase (NSE), and B‐Tubulin III. Cell survival is measured using MTT assays and cell proliferation is measured using colony formation assays. To measure CDKN3 levels following retinoic acid treatment and MYCN knockdown western blot is used. Results: We have found that siCDKN3 NB cells show increased expression of differentiation markers; siCDKN3 cells also have increased neurite outgrowth and are less viable than control cells. Conclusions: In conclusion it appears that CDKN3 is involved in differentiation in NB because knockdown of CDKN3 resulted in increased differentiation markers, neurite outgrowth, and a decrease in cell viability. Future work: We will examine the effect of siCDKN3 on proliferation. We will also examine CDKN3 levels following retinoic acid treatment and MYCN knockdown.","",""

Most existing approaches to manufacturing capability evaluation and analysis use structured and formal capability models as input. However, manufacturing suppliers often publish their capability data in an unstructured format. The unstructured capability data usually portrays a more realistic view of the services a supplier can offer. If parsed and analyzed properly, unstructured capability data can be used effectively for initial screening and characterization of manufacturing suppliers specially when dealing with a large pool of prospective suppliers. This work proposes a novel framework for capability-based supplier classification that relies on the unstructured capability narratives available on the suppliers’ websites. Naïve Bayes is used as the text classification technique. One of the innovative aspects of this work is incorporating a thesaurus-guided method for feature selection and tokenization of capability data. The thesaurus contains the informal vocabulary used in the contract machining industry for advertising manufacturing capabilities. An Entity Extractor Tool (EET) is developed for the generation of the concept vector model associated with each capability narrative. The proposed supplier classification framework is validated experimentally through forming two capability classes, namely, heavy component machining and difficult and complex machining, based on real capability data.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/DETC2017-67652/2473205/v001t02a075-detc2017-67652.pdf",""

Individuals making purchasing decisions in 5 market sectors of the steer/heifer and cow/bull beef supply chain were interviewed, including packers (n = 36), retailers (including large and small supermarket companies and warehouse food sales companies; n = 35), food service operators (including quick-serve, full-service, and institutional establishments; n = 29), further processors (n = 64), and peripherally-related government and trade organizations (GTO; n = 30). Face-to-face interviews were conducted between January and November of 2016 using a designed dynamic routing system. Definitions (as described by interviewees) for 7 pre-determined quality factors, including: (1) How and where the cattle were raised, (2) Lean, fat, and bone, (3) Weight and size, (4) Visual characteristics, (5) Food safety, (6) Eating satisfaction, and (7) Cattle genetics were recorded verbatim and categorized into similar responses for analysis. Compared to NBQA-2011, a higher percentage of companies were willing to pay premiums for guaranteed quality attributes, but overall were willing to pay lower average premiums than the companies interviewed in 2011. Food safety had the highest share of preference among all interviewees, generating a double-digit advantage over any other quality factor. The 2 beef industries have an overall positive image among interviewees, and despite lingering weaknesses, product quality continued to be at the forefront of the strengths category for both steer and heifer beef and market cow and bull beef.","http://academic.oup.com/tas/article-pdf/1/3/320/33234159/320.pdf",""

Many researchers and educators argue the construct is too vague and contradictory to be useful for educators. Nevertheless, attention to dyslexia in policy and practice has increased at a rapid rate; 37 states now have dyslexia laws, and national legislation was passed in 2016. Employing Bakhtin’s concept of authoritative discourse (AD) as a theoretical lens, we examined the emergence and current state of dyslexia legislation and policy in Texas, Indiana, and Florida, three states that represent various histories of legislation and stages of policy implementation. Our analysis found similarities among the states’ legislation, particularly regarding how the policies emerged and the AD embedded within them. The International Dyslexia Society’s recommendations for a specific intervention approach that is “multisensory, systematic, and structured” appear in each state’s laws. This approach is not well supported by research, but it is officially sanctioned through legislation in many states and has had a profound effect on policy and practice. By not engaging in the discourse or using the word “dyslexia,” literacy researchers and educators place themselves outside of a closed discourse circle that influences policy and practice and deeply affects students. We encourage active participation in the conversation and in policy decisions that are currently taking place without the input of literacy educators and researchers.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2381336917718501",""

LCN2 is upregulated in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and in obese individuals, but whether it contributes to PDAC development is unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of Lcn2 depletion on diet-induced obesity, inflammation, and PDAC development. Mice with acinar cell–specific expression of KrasG12D were crossed with Lcn2-depleted animals and fed isocaloric diets with varying amounts of fat content. Pancreas were collected and analyzed for inflammation, pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), and PDAC. We also used a syngeneic orthotopic PDAC mouse model to study tumor growth in the presence or absence of Lcn2 expression. In addition, to understand the mechanistic role of how LCN2 could be mediating PDAC, we studied LCN2 and its specific receptor solute carrier family 22 member 17 (SLC22A17) in human pancreatic cancer stellate cells (PSC), key mediators of the PDAC stroma. Depletion of Lcn2 diminished extracellular matrix deposition, immune cell infiltration, PanIN formation, and tumor growth. Notably, it also increased survival in both obesity-driven and syngeneic orthotopic PDAC mouse models. LCN2 modulated the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in PSC of the PDAC tumor microenvironment, whereas downregulation of LCN2-specific receptor SLC22A17 blocked these effects. Our results reveal how LCN2 acts in the tumor microenvironment links obesity, inflammation, and PDAC development.

About 60% of the newly diagnosed cases have already spread to the lymph nodes, where children with this disease typically don't live past 10 years of age. NB arises from the failure of neural crest cell precursors to differentiate, which inhibits the maturation of these cells, leaving immortal, infant, malignant cells. The identification of new targets involved in differentiation is crucial for the elucidation of this disease. Differentiation therapy involves the induction of malignant cells to mature and undergo apoptosis, and relies on the discovery of targetable biological molecules that play a role in NB cell differentiation. Methods: To carry out these aims, the NB cells are treated with ATRA and the miR‐506‐3p mimic, and then are analyzed for neurite outgrowth, or maturation of the cells. Cell viability is determined with an MTT assay. After treatment with ATRA, the confirmation of differentiation is detected using Western Blot, with known NB differentiation markers (i.e. growth associated protein 43, β Tubulin (III), neuron specific enolase, and Calnexin). Expected Results: It is anticipated that following treatment with ATRA and the miR mimic, the NB cells will exhibit a strict correlation and cell sensitivity to these treatments. The NB cells with different genetic backgrounds, such as MYCN amplification, may display a decreased sensitivity to ATRA and the miR mimic, while combined treatment may provide a synergistic effect on the NB cells. Conclusions: If a strict correlation between ATRA and the miR mimic is observed, this may be indicative of the same pathway being targeted by these treatments, allowing for more insight into the mechanisms of differentiation loss in NB cells. After observing a synergistic effect from combined treatment of ATRA and miR‐506‐3p mimic on NB cells, it may be determined that different treatment methods may be more effective than traditional methods, in treating patients (i.e. high‐risk) with this disease.","",""

Discrimination, however, can still be an obstacle for many children of Latinx immigrants because they often receive less sophisticated and dynamic learning experiences than their white, native-born peers. In this article, Jennifer Keys Adair, Kiyomi Sánchez-Suzuki Colegrove, and Molly E. McManus detail how this type of educational discrimination is perpetuated by educators' acceptance of the “word gap” discourse. Drawing on empirical work with more than two hundred superintendents, administrators, teachers, parents, and young children, they recount how caring, experienced educators explained that Latinx immigrant students could not handle dynamic, agentic learning experiences because they lacked vocabulary and how the children in those classrooms said that learning required still, obedient, and quiet bodies. Rather than blaming educators, the authors share this empirical evidence to demonstrate the harm that can come from denying young children a range of sophisticated learning experiences, especially when institutionally and publicly justified by deficit-oriented research and thinking. Using the work of Charles Mills, the authors argue that such a denial of experience to children of Latinx immigrants and other marginalized communities is discriminatory and, too often, the status quo.","http://meridian.allenpress.com/her/article-pdf/87/3/309/2111884/1943-5045-87_3_309.pdf",""

Recent evidence has reported cognitive impairments may be associated with increases in systemic inflammation due to cancer and its treatment. There is an increasing need to determine whether modifiable factors, such as nutrition, may reduce the risk or severity of CRCI. The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the inflammatory potential of the diet and memory in breast cancer survivors (BCS) and to explore reduced inflammation as a potential mechanism by which diet influences cognitive function. Methods: In this cross‐sectional study, sixty‐seven women (29 BCS; 38 controls) were recruited from the Central Texas area. BCS had to have completed primary treatment (either chemotherapy, radiotherapy or both) within the past 5 years, and controls must have had no previous cancer diagnosis. Participants completed the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery which included the list sorting working memory and picture sequence memory tests. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy‐Cognitive Function, a validated questionnaire, was used to assess perceived cognitive impairment. Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) was computed from FFQ estimated dietary intakes. Serum levels of soluble TNF receptor type II (sTNF‐RII), interleukin‐6 (IL‐6), and C‐reactive protein (CRP) were measured by ELISA. Differences between BCS and age‐matched controls were assessed using linear mixed models, and linear regression analyses were conducted to determine the relationship between predictors and objective and subjective cognitive function. Results: BCS performed similarly to age‐matched controls on memory tasks, but had significantly more cognitive complaints as assessed by Perceived Cognitive Impairments (p <.001), Comments from Others (p = .001) Impact on Quality of Life (p = .003) and Perceived Cognitive Abilities (p <.001) subscales. Serum sTNF‐RII, but not IL‐6 or CRP, was significantly higher in BCS. The inflammatory biomarkers were not significant predictors of objective or subjective cognitive function and were not associated with DII scores. DII did not predict objective memory performance. In BCS, higher DII, indicating a more pro‐inflammatory diet, was associated with significantly more severe impacts of pereceived cognitive impairments on quality of life (p=.035). Conclusion: DII was not associated with levels of inflammatory markers or objective cognitive function in BCS. However, future research should continue to identify dietary patterns that can reduce memory complaints and support cognitive health in cancer survivors.","",""

Our events are substantially interdisciplinary, and include a variety of STEM topics in addition to the biological sciences. For example, we incorporate concepts like density and mass to draw connections between mathematics and physics and their practical applications. These accessible experiments help the community at large engage and develop critical thinking and reasoning skills. Texas State students derive significant benefit from these events, too, as these opportunities enable our student chapter members to utilize their science education as an instrument to connect with their community while encouraging young minds to engage in learning outside of the classroom environment.

Because inside debt holdings are generally unsecured and unfunded liabilities of the firm, CEOs are exposed to risk similar to that faced by outside creditors. As such, theory (Jensen and Meckling [1976]) suggests that inside debt holdings negatively impact CEO risk‐appetite. To the extent that corporate tax shelters are likely to result in high cash flow volatility in the future, we expect that inside debt holdings will curb CEOs from engaging in tax shelter transactions. Consistent with the prediction, we document a negative association between CEO inside debt holdings and tax sheltering. Additional analyses suggest that the effect of inside debt on tax sheltering is more (less) pronounced in the presence of high default risk and liquidity threats (cash‐out options in pension packages). Overall, our results highlight the importance of investigating the implication of CEO debt‐like compensation for corporate tax policies.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2F1475-679X.12169",""

Rather, the health care provider (HCP) has an important role in fostering behavior change and maintenance by asking, “Why do people change?” and “What can I do to help?” This review highlights 4 evidence-based factors related to medication adherence, when lifestyle is the medicine. (1) Autonomy is the belief that one is the origin of his or her own actions, and must be supported by the HCP (eg, “My HCP listens to how I would like to do things regarding my health”). (2) Competence and confidence ensure that patients believe they can succeed. These are gained through mastery experience, vicarious experience, and through positive and constructive feedback on past performance (eg, “My HCP conveys confidence in my ability to make changes regarding my health”). (3) Coping planning is being able to formulate a plan of intention, with the awareness of barriers and emotional regulation that can inhibit patient behavior (eg, “I feel able to share my feelings with my HCP”). (4) Personal values of the patients are used to understand how and why they cope when there is a threat to these values (eg, “My HCP tries to understand how I see my health before suggesting any changes”).","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1559827617697922",""

Methods: The data used in this study include all 582 educators who were disciplined for misconduct in the 2012–2013 school year in Texas. Various descriptive and significance tests were used to answer the hypotheses of this study. Results: Some of the findings correspond with the findings of the criminal justice literature while others do not. Young, male, and black educators are more likely to offend. Contrary to the literature on “student discipline” and “criminal justice,” minority educators are not treated more harshly when they are disciplined. There are some offenses committed more often by younger, male, and those educators who have held their credentials for a shorter amount of time. Conclusion: The results have raised many questions similar to the ones studied in the field of criminal justice. A new body of research needs to address questions such as discrimination and the constitutional rights of the accused and the victims.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0034523717746435",""

The cross method samples the data at increasing distances between finite-difference calculations. The traditional QG omega equation is evaluated with each upscaling technique and found to be reliable between 800 and 200 hPa. The minimum QG length scale is found to be L = 140 km considering correlations of QG omega back to operational model values, which are for both methods on an “extended” QG omega. The box method performs marginally better than the cross method due to a larger reduction of QG forcing in higher-order wavenumbers, but at the appropriate length scale, both methods have indistinguishable correlations.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/mwr/article-pdf/145/5/1659/4359635/mwr-d-16-0241_1.pdf",""

The HSAR is capable of producing parameter estimates for each region in the sample, that follow a spatial autoregressive process. Spatial autoregressive processes apply geometric decay of influence to higher‐order neighboring regions. The HMESS takes a similar approach as the HSAR to produce estimates for each region in the sample, but relies on a matrix exponential function to apply exponential decay to higher‐order neighbors. The MESS introduced by LeSage and Pace (2007) for the case of cross‐sectional spatial data samples has some potential computational advantages over the spatial autoregressive specification. In addition, the spatial dependence parameter in the MESS ranges from minus to plus infinity, which allows for use of normal priors assigned to this parameter in a Bayesian setting. We extend the cross‐sectional MESS to the case of a heterogeneous coefficients model, and describe Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo estimation. We illustrate the HMESS model with a panel wage curve relationship using quarterly unemployment and wage rates from 261 counties centered on the Bakken shale oil region in North Dakota and Montana.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fgean.12152",""

Stress in the GaN are mapped both over the full wafer and across the layer along the growth direction. Ultraviolet (UV) and visible micro‐Raman and UV photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy from both sides of the wafer reveal an unexpected gradient between the tensile stress at the free GaN surface (∼0.86–0.90 GPa) and the GaN/diamond interface (∼0.05–0.23 GPa). The stresses obtained exhibit good cross‐wafer uniformity. The stress gradient is understood through variations in the material along the growth direction of the layers due to the presence of threading dislocations which result in local stress relaxation. Transmission electron microscopy confirms the presence of extended defects to be greater near the interface with diamond, corresponding to the initial GaN growth regime, and diminished toward the surface where transistors would be fabricated in a full device technology. Finite element (FE) simulations describing the observed stress dependence along with TEM imaging of the GaN cross‐section support the relaxation interpretation.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/am-pdf/10.1002/pssc.201600247",""

Hole-making is the most common machining operation done on carbon fiber reinforced plastics, where delamination is a major issue. Delamination reduces structural integrity and increases assembly tolerance, which leads to rejection of a part or a component. Comparatively, rotary ultrasonic machining has been successfully applied to hole-making in carbon fiber reinforced plastics. As reported in the literature, rotary ultrasonic machining is superior to twist drilling of carbon fiber reinforced plastics in six aspects: cutting force, torque, surface roughness, delamination, tool life, and material removal rate. This paper investigates the effects of tool end angle on delamination in rotary ultrasonic machining of carbon fiber reinforced plastics. Several investigators have cited thrust force as a major cause for delamination. Eventhogh, it is found on this investigation, tool end angle has more significant influence on the delamination in rotary ultrasonic machining of carbon fiber reinforced plastics comparing to cutting force and torque.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/MSEC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/MSEC2017-2863/2519053/v001t02a015-msec2017-2863.pdf",""

The problem of interest was the need for increased dissemination of improved agricultural practices to enhance production and processing of crops related to food security and socio-economic well-being. The study investigated associations between adoptive behaviors of participants and their subsequent behavior related to diffusing improved practices to others. Data was collected using a demographic questionnaire and two structured interview schedules. Correlational analysis was conducted on post-training behavior variables, using Kendall’s tau calculations. The study found that farmers across the samples who exhibited higher levels of adoption of workshop-recommended innovations also had a moderate to strong likelihood of showing correspondingly higher levels of diffusion-related behavior. It was concluded that these findings align well with Rogers’ (2003) discussion of change-agent credibility, and also with Bandura’s (2006) work on social modeling and perceived self-efficacy. It was recommended that offering community-based agricultural seminars such as those in this study be continued and expanded, as an important component in a pluralistic model of agricultural extension methodology for Sub-Saharan Africa. It was further recommended that farmers who adopt improved practices learned in training be identified specifically for further interventions related to implementation and diffusion of agricultural innovations.","",""

Data were collected at 17 beef processing facilities between March and November 2016. About 8,000 live cattle were evaluated for transportation and mobility, and about 25,000 carcasses were evaluated on the slaughter floor. Cattle were in transit to the slaughter facility for a mean duration of 2.7 h from a mean distance of 218.5 km using trailers with dimensions ranging from 17.84 m2 to 59.09 m2. Area allotted per animal averaged 1.13 m2 and ranged from 0.85 m2 to 2.28 m2. A total of 96.8% of cattle received a mobility score of 1 (walks easily, no apparent lameness). Identification types (35.1% had multiple) were lot visual tags (61.5%), individual tags (55.0%), electronic tags (16.9%), metal-clip tags (9.2%), bar-coded tags (0.05%), wattles (0.01%), and other (2.6%). Cattle were black-hided (57.8%), Holstein (20.4%), red-hided (10.5%), yellow-hided (4.8%), gray-hided (2.9%), brown-hided (1.3%), and white-hided (1.1%). Unbranded hides were observed on 74.3% of cattle; 18.6% had brands located on the butt, 6.3% on the side, and 1.3% on the shoulder (values exceed 100% due to multiple brands). For hide-on carcasses, 37.7% displayed no mud or manure; specific locations for mud or manure were legs (40.8%), belly (33.0%), tail region (15.5%), side (6.8%), and top-line (3.9%). Cattle without horns represented 83.3% of the sample, and cattle that did have horns measured: &lt; 2.54 cm (5.5%), 2.54 to 12.7 cm (8.3%), and &gt; 12.7 cm (2.9%). Carcasses without bruises represented 61.1% of those sampled, whereas 28.2% had 1, 8.2% had 2, 2.1% had 3, and 0.3% had 4 bruises. Of those carcasses with a bruise, the bruise was located on the loin (29.7%), round (27.8%), chuck (16.4%), rib (14.4%), and brisket/plate/flank (11.6%). Frequencies of offal condemnations were livers (30.8%), lungs (18.2%), viscera (16.3%), hearts (11.1%), heads (2.7%), and tongues (2.0%). Compared to NBQA-2011, fewer cattle were identified for traceability, fewer were black-hided, a greater number were Holstein cattle, more with no brand and no horns, fewer without bruises, more liver, lung, and viscera condemnations, and fewer heads and tongues were condemned. The NBQA remains an influential survey for the U.S. beef industry to provide benchmarks and strategic plans for continued improvement of beef quality and consistency.","http://academic.oup.com/tas/article-pdf/1/2/229/33234632/229.pdf",""

Sharp, chemically abrupt interfaces and c-axis-oriented BTO films for both types of heterostructures were observed using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and elemental mapping. Anti-phase boundaries as well as ⟨100⟩ misfit dislocations were present in the BTO/STO samples, with the offsets of the dislocation cores varying by distances between 1 and 5 nm away from the BTO/STO interface. Conversely, misfit dislocations were not observed in the BTO/STO/Ge structure although vertical anti-phase boundaries were still common.

Using qualitative interview data, we examine how managers in manufacturing firms integrate internal supply chain activities. We elaborate and extend the information processing view by studying why organizations integrate (integration requirements) and how integration mechanisms are associated with different integration requirements. Four patterns of integration requirement–mechanism linkages emerged from our study, depicting integration mechanisms that are associated with a particular integration requirement, and those that are not. We provide a detailed examination of the multidimensional nature of integration requirements, as well as an increased understanding of how integration mechanisms are used to manage different integration requirements. These findings offer deeper insights into organizational integration, enhancing the understanding of integration in the context of internal supply chains, while also contributing to the literature on organizational design. For supply chain managers, these findings describe ways in which organizational design decisions can support internal SCI efforts with varying aims.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fjbl.12165",""

A Jones matrix which describes both effects simultaneously, was derived for a single axis PEM and used to find an expression for the detector signal for two different MO Kerr setups. The effect of the PEM tilt angle, polarizer angle, analyzer angle, and retardation, on the detector signal offsets show that offsets can be zeroed by adjusting PEM tilt angle, polarizer angle, and retardation. This strategy will allow one to avoid large offset drifts due to the small retardation, intensity, and beam direction fluctuations caused by lab temperature fluctuations. In addition, it will enable one to measure in the most sensitive range of the lock-in amplifiers further improving the signal to noise ratio of the setup.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/adv/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.4999517/13092004/085320_1_online.pdf",""

While prior research theorizes that both stable personality traits and temporary states influence PS (e.g., Hurtt 2010; Nelson 2009), this literature tends to focus on either trait PS or contextual factors that influence judgments and behavior without disentangling the trait and state components of PS. We propose that state PS is a distinct construct from trait PS and provide the first measure of state PS. We validate our process for measuring state PS using rigorous analyses, demonstrating convergent and divergent validity with data collected from both professional and student samples. Furthermore, we replicate the Hurtt (2010) trait PS scale, which forms the basis for our state PS measure. Future researchers can employ our measure or, alternatively, replicate our process for measuring state PS in various experimental contexts.","https://publications.aaahq.org/ajpt/article-pdf/37/1/215/50052/ajpt-51738.pdf",""

Due to the inhomogeneous and anisotropic properties, and high abrasiveness of the reinforcement in CFRP composites, they are classified as difficult-to-cut materials in surface grinding processes. Many problems (including high cutting force and low machining efficiency) are generated in conventional surface grinding processes. In order to reduce and eliminate these problems, rotary ultrasonic machining (RUM) surface grinding of CFRP composites is conducted in this investigation. Effects of ultrasonic power in different machining levels are of great importance in RUM surface grinding processes. However, no investigations on effects of ultrasonic power in different machining levels are conducted in such a process.

We examine the submarine landslide potential with new shear strength measurements acquired by Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 341 on the continental slope and Surveyor Fan. These data reveal lower than expected sediment strength. Contrary to other active margins where seismic strengthening enhances slope stability, the high‐sedimentation margin offshore southern Alaska behaves like a passive margin from a shear strength perspective. We interpret that seismic strengthening occurs but is offset by high sedimentation rates and overpressure. This conclusion is supported by shear strength outside of the fan that follow an active margin trend.

With a nationwide random sample of non-Hispanic White, older individuals (60+), living in their homes ( N = 328), three segments of senior residents based on their reasons for aging-in-place were identified. Results reinforce the importance of community-based integrative programs and policies by indicating that the three identified clusters were not homogeneous; however, inclusive community-based supports and services can provide what each cluster needs to successfully age-in-place.

The objective was to determine the incidence of producer-related defects, and report cattle and carcass traits associated with producer management. Conducted from March through December of 2016, trailers (n = 154), live animals (n = 5,470), hide-on carcasses (n = 5,278), and hide-off hot carcasses (n = 5,510) were surveyed in 18 commercial packing facilities throughout the United States. Cattle were allowed 2.3 m2 of trailer space on average during transit indicating some haulers are adhering to industry handling guidelines for trailer space requirements. Of the mixed gender loads arriving at processing facilities, cows and bulls were not segregated on 64.4% of the trailers surveyed. When assessed for mobility, the greatest majority of cattle surveyed were sound. Since the inception of the quality audit series, beef cows have shown substantial improvements in muscle. Today over 90.0% of dairy cows are too light muscled. The mean body condition score for beef animals was 4.7 and for dairy cows and bulls was 2.6 and 3.3, respectively. Dairy cattle were lighter muscled, yet fatter than the dairy cattle surveyed in 2007. Of cattle surveyed, most did not have horns, nor any visible live animal defects. Unbranded hides were observed on 77.3% of cattle. Carcass bruising was seen on 64.1% of cow carcasses and 42.9% of bull carcasses. However, over half of all bruises were identified to only be minor in severity. Nearly all cattle (98.4%) were free of visible injection-site lesions. Current results suggest improvements have been made in cattle and meat quality in the cow and bull sector. Furthermore, the results provide guidance for continued educational and research efforts for improving market cow and bull beef quality.","http://academic.oup.com/tas/article-pdf/1/4/570/33234528/570.pdf",""

We find an interesting inverse relationship between EP errors and Underexhaustive errors over development: the point at which children stop making Underexhaustive errors is also when they begin making EP errors. Underexhaustive errors, common at early stages in our study, may be indicative of a non-adult, non-exhaustive semantics for every. EP errors, which emerge later, and remain frequent even at age 7, are progressive in nature and were also found with adults in a control study.

Reservoir pressure profiles associated with steady-state, pseudosteady-state, and transient flow for a constant pressure drawdown were derived decades ago. These profiles, however, may not be applicable near the end-life of a well due to the unstable nature of fluid flow in the wellbore (e.g., liquid loading, slugging), and could explain why certain wells stop flowing before predicted.

The Two-Phase Dynamic IPR not only couples the wellbore bottomhole flowing pressure with oil and gas flow rates, but it also provides the pressure profile within the reservoir. Commercial software are capable of coupling discretized reservoir simulators to wellbore models; however, these are computationally more expensive and complex than the Dynamic IPR. The use of conventional IPRs, on the other hand, is simple and straightforward, but they cannot account for the wellbore-reservoir dynamic, making them inaccurate in fully transient models.","http://onepetro.org/SPEATCE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/187232-MS/1271467/spe-187232-ms.pdf",""

This kind of rich network representation presents challenges for anomaly detection due to the heterogeneity of two data representations. A vast majority of existing algorithms assume certain properties of anomalies are given a prior. Since various types of anomalies in real-world attributed networks co-exist, the assumption that priori knowledge regarding anomalies is available does not hold. In this paper, we investigate the problem of anomaly detection in attributed networks generally from a residual analysis perspective, which has been shown to be effective in traditional anomaly detection problems. However, it is a non-trivial task in attributed networks as interactions among instances complicate the residual modeling process. Methodologically, we propose a learning framework to characterize the residuals of attribute information and its coherence with network information for anomaly detection. By learning and analyzing the residuals, we detect anomalies whose behaviors are singularly different from the majority. Experiments on real datasets show the effectiveness and generality of the proposed framework.","",""

Consequently, using climate theory and research as a conceptual basis, we inductively articulated safety climate’s general content domain by identifying seven core indicators of safety’s perceived workplace priority: leader safety commitment, safety communication, safety training, coworker safety practices, safety equipment and housekeeping, safety involvement, and safety rewards. These indicators formed the basis for a generalized safety climate measure that we designed for use across organizations, industries, and construct levels. We then conducted a multilevel construct validation of safety climate using the newly created measure in two separate studies. Results from five samples spanning multiple organizations, industries, and cultural settings revealed that the identified safety climate indicators were parsimoniously explained by an overarching safety climate factor at the individual and workgroup levels. In addition, multilevel homology tests indicated that safety climate’s associations with past safety incidents were nearly two times stronger at the workgroup level relative to the individual level, although this difference was not statistically significant. Finally, workgroup-level validity evidence demonstrated expected associations between safety climate and organization-reported pre- and postsurvey safety incidents. On the basis of this supportive evidence, we recommend that this conceptualization and measure of safety climate be adopted in research and practice to facilitate future scientific progress.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0149206317745596",""

Current research underemphasizes the role of third‐party state domestic conditions as precipitating the resort to conflict management. To do so, we formulate two explanations linking third‐party state domestic politics to conflict management with rebels: (1) gambling for resurrection, in which a weak third‐party state leader eschews conflict management in the pursuit of a victory that will rehabilitate his or her political survival; and (2) cutting losses, in which a weak third‐party leader resorts to conflict management to reduce the domestic political costs associated with continued fighting. Method: We identify a sample of 32 civil conflicts during the 1960–2004 period in which a third‐party state deploys troops to defend a central government against a rebellion. We code the timing of negotiation and mediation offers between the third‐party and the rebels. We then rely on third‐party state economic conditions as a barometer of the political survival that shapes the third‐party's resort to conflict management. Results: A logit analysis supports the cutting losses expectation that third‐party states seek conflict management when political survival at home is at risk.

The presence of serum antibodies to HPV‐16 early (E) antigens is associated with an increased risk for OPC. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of antibodies to a panel of HPV‐16 E antigens in screening for OPC. METHODS: This case‐control study included 378 patients with OPC, 153 patients with nonoropharyngeal head and neck cancer (non‐OPC), and 782 healthy control subjects. The tumor HPV status was determined with p16 immunohistochemistry and HPV in situ hybridization. HPV‐16 E antibody levels in serum were identified with an enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay. A trained binary logistic regression model based on the combination of all E antigens was predefined and applied to the data set. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay for distinguishing HPV‐related OPC from controls were calculated. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for the association of head and neck cancer with the antibody status. RESULTS: Of the 378 patients with OPC, 348 had p16‐positive OPC. HPV‐16 E antibody levels were significantly higher among patients with p16‐positive OPC but not among patients with non‐OPC or among controls. Serology showed high sensitivity and specificity for HPV‐related OPC (binary classifier: 83% sensitivity and 99% specificity for p16‐positive OPC). CONCLUSIONS: A trained binary classification algorithm that incorporates information about multiple E antibodies has high sensitivity and specificity and may be advantageous for risk stratification in future screening trials.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fcncr.30955",""

PURPOSE: The BLINK study is a National Eye Institute–sponsored, double-masked, randomized clinical trial to investigate the effects of soft multifocal contact lenses on myopia progression. This article describes the subjects’ baseline characteristics and study methods. METHODS: Subjects were 7 to 11 years old, had −0.75 to −5.00 spherical component and less than 1.00 diopter (D) astigmatism, and had 20/25 or better logMAR distance visual acuity with manifest refraction in each eye and with +2.50-D add soft bifocal contact lenses on both eyes. Children were randomly assigned to wear Biofinity single-vision, Biofinity Multifocal “D” with a +1.50-D add power, or Biofinity Multifocal “D” with a +2.50-D add power contact lenses. RESULTS: We examined 443 subjects at the baseline visits, and 294 (66.4%) subjects were enrolled. Of the enrolled subjects, 177 (60.2%) were female, and 200 (68%) were white. The mean (± SD) age was 10.3 ± 1.2 years, and 117 (39.8%) of the eligible subjects were younger than 10 years. The mean spherical equivalent refractive error, measured by cycloplegic autorefraction was −2.39 ± 1.00 D. The best-corrected binocular logMAR visual acuity with glasses was +0.01 ± 0.06 (20/21) at distance and −0.03 ± 0.08 (20/18) at near. CONCLUSIONS: The BLINK study subjects are similar to patients who would routinely be eligible for myopia control in practice, so the results will provide clinical information about soft bifocal contact lens myopia control as well as information about the mechanism of the treatment effect, if one occurs.","https://journals.lww.com/00006324-201709000-00002",""

In contrast to physical immobilization, physical activity and exercise improves metabolic health. Using a rodent model of disuse (hindlimb unloading) combined with resistance exercise, we determined if moderate resistance exercise could negate the effects of disuse on the metabolic profile of white adipose tissue (WAT). Male rats were assigned to four groups 1) Ambulatory No Exercise (ANE); 2) Ambulatory Exercise (AE); 3) Hindlimb Unloaded No Exercise (HUNE); 4) Hindlimb Unloaded Exercise (HUE). All rats completed a 10‐day pre‐training resistance exercise regiment prior to random group assignments. HUNE and HUE animals were placed in a tail traction system with their hindlimbs unloaded and were followed for 14 days. Animals designated to AE or HUE groups exercised for 14 days. At day 14, plasma and tissue samples were collected and analyzed. Resistance exercise resulted in a decrease in body mass in the ambulatory animals (AE vs. ANE), and hindlimb unloading significantly decreased body mass compared to ambulatory animals (HUNE and HUE vs. ANE and AE), but there was no additive effect of exercise on body mass (HUNE vs. HUE). Hindlimb unloading reduced hindlimb muscle mass (ANE and AE vs. HUNE and HUE), and resistance exercise partially restored soleus mass in the hindlimb unloaded animals (HUNE vs. HUE). Total white adipose tissue mass (WAT), perigonadal WAT (pgWAT) mass, and subcutaneous WAT (scWAT) mass and adipocyte size were significantly reduced in response to both exercise and hindlimb unloading. Expression of genes and proteins in scWAT involved in fatty acid oxidation and glucose metabolism were significantly increased with exercise (ANE vs. AE), reduced with hindlimb unloading (ANE vs. HUNE), and restored with exercise in the hindlimb unloaded animals (HUNE vs. HUE). In conclusion, these data indicate that moderate resistance exercise improves the metabolic profile of both pgWAT and scWAT in both the ambulatory state and in an animal model of disuse, providing a novel therapeutic benefit for the bed rest patients.","",""

Methods: B‐mode ultrasonography was used to examine the vastus lateralis (VL) and rectus femoris (RF) in 28 boys (mean age = 12 years). Tests of athleticism included jump height and peak velocity, sprint speed, and agility. Peak torque and the rate of torque development (RTD) at 100 and 200 ms from torque onset were assessed. Results: Several significant correlations existed after controlling for age and mass. RF thickness showed the strongest correlations with the dependent variables. Both RTD time intervals, but not peak torque, correlated with VL thickness. Peak torque was greatly influenced by age and mass. Echo intensity and muscle thickness correlated highly with agility performance. Conclusions: VL and RF echo intensity and muscle thickness may help predict athleticism, and to a lesser extent, RTD, in boys.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fmus.25395",""

We focus on problems where the payoff is a linear function of the multivariate uncertainty realization. Such problems can be written as single-stage nonlinear optimization problems composed of partial polyhedral expectations of the multivariate uncertainty. We identify the structural characteristics of multivariate probability density functions under which the integral expressions for the partial expectations can be directly evaluated for an exact value. We then focus on elliptical distributions, which are frequently used in operations management and do have these characteristics. We develop a sequence of three results to determine partial polyhedral expectations of elliptical probability distributions, with a special emphasis on the normal distribution.

The HEXACO-PI provides a theoretical framework to examine the degree to which six broad personality domains and several underlying personality traits influence behavior. A survey utilizing a national sample of 715 participants indicates several narrow underlying personality traits predict BIRGing and CORFing behaviors.

Also, many researchers have been working on the development of various production/simulation approaches to simulate production from the complex fracture geometries. The objective of this study is to combine the fracture-propagation modeling and reservoir simulation to optimize production in shale gas reservoirs. First, we have developed a semianalytical model to simulate shale gas production from the nonplanar-fracture geometry with varying fracture width and fracture permeability along fracture length. The important gas-transport mechanisms such as gas slippage, gas diffusion, and gas desorption are considered. Second, we have developed a fracture-propagation model to predict the nonplanar-fracture geometry by fully coupling elastic deformation of the rock and fluid flow. In this study, the effect of varying number of perforation clusters within a given stage ranging from two to six on the fracture propagation was investigated. Three values of stage spacing were considered including 100, 200, and 300 ft. After predicting the nonplanar-fracture geometry, the semianalytical model is used to simulate production from such fracture geometries. The effects of the number of clusters per stage for varying stage spacing on well productivity were examined. In addition, we compared the well performance with varying stage spacings of 100, 200, and 300 ft under a given lateral length of 2,500 ft. Furthermore, we coupled the fracture-propagation and semianalytical models to analyze a field well performance in a shale gas reservoir. Through the field-case study, a nonplanar-fracture geometry with a good history match was quantified. Also, the difference between the nonplanar-fracture geometry and the converted equivalent planar-fracture geometry with equal fracture length was examined. Finally, the optimal fracture-treatment design for the field well development was recommended. This work can provide new insights into optimization of the number of perforation clusters per stage within a given fracture stage in shale gas reservoirs.","http://onepetro.org/REE/article-pdf/20/04/1004/2355492/spe-175109-pa.pdf",""

Human capital theory also suggests that not all employees possess knowledge and skills that are of equal strategic importance to the organization. Thus, organizations will seek to retain and develop employees that are mission crucial, while pursuing service delivery alternatives such as contracting out for non-essential goals. Utilizing a national survey of local government human resource professionals, the present study assesses the role long-term and short-term human resource planning plays in the contracting out of human resource functions. The results suggest that contracting out human resource services may be less of a factor in long-term strategic management assessments. In contrast to local governments lacking workforce planning metrics, municipalities that have the capacity to engage in sophisticated long-term human resource planning may not face the same managerial, fiscal, and political pressures to contract out.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/073491491704100206",""

The detection of viral RNA is highly sensitive and specific, but periods of viremia and viruria are brief, limiting the utility of ZIKV RNA assays. Instead, most ZIKV infections are diagnosed serologically, using an IgM antibody capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MAC-ELISA) for screening, followed by a confirmatory plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Typical turnaround times vary, due to assay incubation periods and a lack of clinical laboratories performing these tests. Recently, a novel luciferase-ZIKV- and -dengue virus (DENV)-based serological assay, which considerably improves the turnaround times and throughput for ZIKV diagnosis, was described. Using the traditional PRNT as a reference method, we evaluated the performance characteristics of the reporter virus neutralization test (RVNT) with 258 clinical serum specimens. The ZIKV RVNT produced primary ZIKV screening and secondary confirmation results in 4 days, with 100% reproducibility. As a screening assay, the ZIKV RVNT displayed excellent diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 98.2%, 100%, and 98.1%, respectively. As a confirmatory assay, the ZIKV RVNT titers displayed 93.1% agreement with the traditional ZIKV PRNT titers. Overall, the RVNT accurately and reliably detects neutralizing antibodies in patient serum specimens, with improved turnaround times, and can be used for the serological detection of ZIKV infections. Due to the homogeneous 96-well format, the RVNT has also significantly improved the assay throughput to allow testing of a large number of specimens in a single run.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JCM.00975-17",""

The analysis of the slope of the playing field in the electoral arena reveals that political competition was fundamentally unfair, placing the regime in the competitive authoritarian category. This conclusion is reached on grounds of the incumbent's capture of the electoral management body, as well as highly discriminatory electoral laws drawn by the incumbent, among many other factors that rendered Ecuadorean electoral contests unfair.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1866802X1700900305",""

However, there is concern that a perceived threat of retaliation negatively affects one's attitude toward whistleblowing. The objective of this study is to examine whether the employee, even under threat of retaliation, can be persuaded to change his or her attitude toward blowing the whistle. The Elaboration Likelihood Model is used as the theoretical lens to investigate whether attitude change toward whistleblowing can occur and how perceived threat of retaliation impacts the persuasion process. This experimental study provides evidence that persuasive messages can change employee attitude toward whistleblowing but this change is most pronounced when persuasive messages are presented to employees who perceive a high threat of retaliation and are familiar with misconduct within the organization.","https://publications.aaahq.org/bria/article-pdf/29/2/97/55405/bria-51729.pdf",""

ENaC is a heterotrimeric channel located mainly in tight or high resistance epithelia and allows for the passive transport of Na+ into the epithelial cell from the lumen. In the nephron, ENaC regulates the final 3–5% reabsorption of Na+ and is a limiting factor for Na+ reabsorption in the kidneys. Because of its role in the kidneys, ENaC is thought to be a critical component in the control of blood pressure. Though there have been several accessory proteins known to regulate ENaC function, there are still questions to be answered about the role other proteins play in ENaC trafficking and assembly. Understanding the mechanisms behind ENaC regulation will potentially provide insight into certain defects in the trafficking or assembly of the channel, and identify possible therapeutic targets. Through survival dilution growth assays in yeast deletion strains, several genes were shown to effect ENaC function in a high salt growth media. Yeast deletion strains expressing αENaC but lacking ER degradation enhancing alpha‐mannosidase like protein 3 (EDEM3) or nuclear protein localization 4 (NPL4) showed an increase in the growth of yeast cells compared to wildtype indicating a loss in ENaC function. A syntaxin 3 yeast deletion strain expressing αENaC resulted in decreased cell growth indicating a gain in ENaC function. Preliminary studies on the knockdown of EDEM3 using a CRISPR/Cas9 knockout plasmid in a M‐1 mammalian cell line endogenously expressing αβγENaC, demonstrated a decrease of ENaC protein expression levels.","",""

Indeed, the double in Gothic literature helps to push the bounds of subjective tension so central to the genre, as subject and object are most urgently and forebodingly called into question when they appear seemingly identical and disturbingly interchangeable. Poe's mastery of this delicate subjective interplay goes without question. This article complicates the readings of two of Poe's overt doppelgänger tales, “Morella” and “William Wilson,” by factoring the influence of place into the equation of selfhood at the heart of each tale. In exploring Poe's subjective project as a fundamentally spatial one, it suggests that Poe's doubles work in concert with the liminal places they occupy in order to orient the self in more profound ways. Aware of the philosophical work of his contemporaries, Poe utilizes necessarily liminal places in both of these tales as a means to continue this work from a literary direction; Poe's interstitial places work as heterotopic mirrors, therefore offering symbolic terrain for interrogating the limits of subjectivity, while yielding a nuanced critique of the discovery and designation of the self in psychological and literary landscapes.","https://scholarlypublishingcollective.org/psup/edgar-allan-poe/article-pdf/18/2/218/1257019/edgallpoerev_18_2_218.pdf",""

One of the most frequently used implicit measures of stereotypes is the sequential priming paradigm. The current meta-analysis examines stereotype priming, focusing specifically on this paradigm. To contribute to ongoing discussions regarding methodological rigor in social psychology, one primary goal was to identify methodological moderators of the stereotype priming effect—whether priming is due to a relation between the prime and target stimuli, the prime and target response, participant task, stereotype dimension, stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA), and stimuli type. Data from 39 studies yielded 87 individual effect sizes from 5,497 participants. Analyses revealed that stereotype priming is significantly moderated by the presence of prime–response relations, participant task, stereotype dimension, target stimulus type, SOA, and prime repetition. These results carry both practical and theoretical implications for future research on stereotype priming.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1088868317723532",""

Two methods have been used to diagnose storm-track variations. In the first method, the storm track is quantified by the temporal-filtered variance of 250-hPa meridional wind (vv250) or mean sea level pressure (pp). The intraseasonal anomalies of vv250 composited for eight MJO phases are characterized by a zonal band of strong positive (or negative) anomalies meandering from the Pacific all the way across North America and the Atlantic into northern Europe, with weaker anomalies of opposite sign at one or both flanks. The results based on pp are consistent with those based on vv250 except for larger zonal variations, which may be induced by surface topography. In the second method, an objective cyclone-tracking scheme has been used to track the extratropical cyclones that compose the storm track. The MJO-composite anomalies of the “accumulated” cyclone activity, a quantity that includes contributions from both the cyclone frequency and cyclone mean intensity, are very similar to those based on pp. Further analysis demonstrates that major contribution comes from variations in the cyclone frequency. Further analysis suggests that the intraseasonal variations of the storm track can be primarily attributed to the variations of the mean flow that responds to the anomalous MJO convections in the tropics, with possible contribution also from the moisture variations.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0513.1",""

This article challenges this reading. Since Irene is the most vocal advocate of an essence in respect to which all blacks are homogenous, much of the evidence for thinking that Passing is skeptical about such an essence amounts to evidence for not trusting Irene's judgment in general, and for not trusting her judgment on this matter in particular. My arguments, then, will often involve explaining why Passing is not leading the reader to mistrust Irene's judgment on this matter. Now, what exactly is meant by a black essence is, explicitly in this book, mysterious. Nevertheless, this article intends to shed some light on how Passing understands the nature of this something, this je ne sais quoi, peculiar to blacks. My tentative interpretation is that this something is an intangible and indefinite manner of being that is neither a conscious choice nor an inborn fact of biology, but rather a given of culture. This article takes this, in effect, blackness manner to be, so Passing seems to indicate, a function of one's belief that one is black in a milieu of pervasive anti-black prejudice. Passing thus has something to offer those today who struggle to adjudicate between a pull towards essentialism and a pull towards constructionism. What Passing emphasizes in this discussion is the possibility that, in addition to biological and societal influences, one's mind state is a crucial ingredient to one's racial identity.","https://scholarlypublishingcollective.org/psup/soundings/article-pdf/100/2/112/1232387/soundings_100_2_112.pdf",""

However, problems such as tissue sticking, thermal damage, and joint failure often occur and need to be solved before the process can be reliably used in more surgical procedures. In this study, experiments were conducted to investigate dynamic behavior of the tissue welding process through electrical impedance measurements. Both scissor-type and parallel electrodes were used with various compression and power settings in the experiment. It was found that the electrical impedance of tissue was lower when parallel electrodes were used. It can be used to understand the results and dynamic behavior of the tissue welding process, including the size of heat affected zone, tissue sticking, and the compression force effect.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/MSEC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/MSEC2017-3091/2519563/v004t05a012-msec2017-3091.pdf",""

Despite available “best practices,” our results indicate that control variable usage in existing leadership studies is rarely grounded in theory but instead frequently relies on outdated misconceptions. Moreover, a meta-analysis of the relationships between popular control variables and leadership constructs finds nearly universal weak effect sizes, suggesting that many studies may not only be losing valuable degrees of freedom but also making inferences based on biased parameter estimates. To address these issues, we put forth a number of recommendations to assist leadership scholars with determining whether potential third variables should be controlled for in their leadership research.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0149206317690586",""

Focusing on the linkages between architecture, sport, and local food in the city, I demonstrate some of the ways in which these realms were woven together in support of the territorial expansion of redevelopment. Following recent research on affect in human geography, I argue that the interweaving of these realms involved careful attention to the material capacities of buildings, athletic bodies, and foods to generate a sense of excitement, pride in place, self-worth, and above all movement in the city. The paper concludes with a discussion of some of the implications of this analysis for the politics of redevelopment and some suggestions for future research.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0308518X17743506",""

We relate the development of this adaptive behavior with ontogenetic changes in myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform expression from 21 days to adulthood. Monodelphis domestica is expected to demonstrate a progressive ability to flex the distal tail up to age 7 mo, when it should exhibit routine nest construction. We hypothesize that juvenile stages (3–7 mo) will be characterized by retention of the neonatal isoform (MHC-Neo), along with predominant expression of fast MHC-2X and -2B, which will transition into greater MHC-1β and -2A isoform content as development progresses. This hypothesis was tested using Q-PCR to quantify and compare gene expression of each isoform with its protein content determined by gel electrophoresis and densitometry. These data were correlated with nesting activity in an age-matched sample of each age group studied. Shifts in regulation of MHC gene transcripts matched well with isoform expression. Notably, mRNA for MHC-Neo and -2B decrease, resulting in little-to-no isoform translation after age 7 mo, whereas mRNA for MHC-1β and -2A increase, and this corresponds with subtle increases in content for these isoforms into late adulthood. Despite the tail remaining intrinsically fast-contracting, a critical growth period for isoform transition is observed between 7 and 13 mo, correlating primarily with use of the tail during nesting activities. Functional transitions in MHC isoforms and fiber type properties may be associated with muscle “tuning” repetitive nest remodeling tasks requiring sustained contractions of the caudal flexors.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/japplphysiol.00651.2016",""

Alkek Library at Texas State University undertook to increase the amount of faculty publications in their institutional repository, known as the Digital Collections. DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM Digital Collections at Texas State University is built on a DSpace platform and serves as the location for electronic theses and dissertations, faculty publications, and other digital Texas State University materials. Despite having launched the service in 2005, the amount of faculty work added to the repository has never been at the levels initially hoped for on launch. DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE WORKFLOW Taking a proactive and cooperative approach, a team of librarians developed and piloted a workflow, in which library staff would retain the already established protocol of gaining faculty permissions prior to uploading material while respecting publisher copyright policies. RESULTS Prior to the vita project, the repository archived 305 faculty publications total. Fifty-seven were added during the pilot, which represents an 18.5% increase. Of a total of 496 articles, seventeen titles were found in the blue category, which allows publisher pdfs to be archived. The majority of articles (233) were found in the green category, which allows either a pre- or a post-print copy of an article to be archived. One hundred ten of the identified titles were in the yellow and white journal categories, representing 22% of our total, and the team was able to archive only five of these. Finally, 16% (81) were not found in the SHERPA/ RoMEO database (color-coded beige). Only 18 of these articles were archived. ASSESSMENT We discovered that our faculty retain nearly none of their pre-print or post-print versions of their published articles, and so we are unable to archive those titles in the repository. Nearly 47% of the articles found were in green journals that allow only pre- or post-print copies. Most faculty were unable to produce versions of their work other than the publisher’s PDF, which many publishers restrict from upload into a repository.","https://www.iastatedigitalpress.com/jlsc/article/12788/galley/12477/download/",""

In this paper, we define features as program’s statements. However, in its fine-grained definition, the idea of program’s features can refer to any traits of programs. This paper proposes feature ranking-based algorithms. The algorithms analyze execution traces of both passing and failing test cases, and extract the bug signatures from the failing test cases. The proposed procedure extracts possible combinations of program’s elements when executed together from bug signatures. The feature ranking-based algorithms then order statements according to the suspiciousness of the combinations. When viewed as sequences, the combination of program’s elements produced and traced in bug signatures can be utilized to reason about the common longest subsequence. The common longest subsequence of bug signatures represents the common statements executed by all failing test cases and thus provides a means for identifying statements that contain possible faults. Our evaluation indicates that the proposed feature-based fault localization outperforms existing fault localization ranking schemes.","https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S0218194017500474",""

Models often rely on buoyant plume theory to parameterize plumes and submarine melting; however, these parameterizations are largely untested due to a dearth of near‐glacier measurements. Here we present a high‐resolution ocean survey by ship and remotely operated boat near the terminus of Kangerlussuup Sermia in west Greenland. These novel observations reveal the 3‐D structure and transport of a near‐surface plume, originating at a large undercut conduit in the glacier terminus, that is inconsistent with axisymmetric plume theory, the most common representation of plumes in ocean‐glacier models. Instead, the observations suggest a wider upwelling plume—a “truncated” line plume of ∼200 m width—with higher entrainment and plume‐driven melt compared to the typical axisymmetric representation. Our results highlight the importance of a subglacial outlet's geometry in controlling plume dynamics, with implications for parameterizing the exchange flow and submarine melt in glacial fjord models.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2F2017GL073602",""

Based on the perspective of spatial educational theory, I conducted a visual framing analysis of three photographs taken during the 2011 Chilean student movement. I employed a four-tiered visual framing method. The three photographs were purposefully selected from different media sources to represent the three dimensions of spatial educational theory, including learning in conceived space, studying in lived space, and teaching in perceived space. In doing so, this article provides a novel way to explain spatial educational theory by visually operationalizing it as a pedagogy for space during the Chilean student movement.

As APIs present the opportunity of increased productivity, it also calls for correct use to avoid buggy code. The usage-based specification mining technique has shown great promise in solving this problem through a data-driven approach. These techniques leverage the use of the API in large corpora to understand the recurring usages of the APIs and infer behavioral specifications (preconditions and postconditions) from such usages. A challenge for such technique is thus inference in the presence of insufficient usages, in terms of both frequency and richness. We refer to this as a ""sparse usage problem."" This paper presents the first technique to solve the sparse usage problem in usage-based precondition mining. Our key insight is to leverage implicit beliefs to overcome sparse usage. An implicit belief (IB) is the knowledge implicitly derived from the fact about the code. An IB about a program is known implicitly to a programmer via the language's constructs and semantics, and thus not explicitly written or specified in the code. The technical underpinnings of our new precondition mining approach include a technique to analyze the data and control flow in the program leading to API calls to infer preconditions that are implicitly present in the code corpus, a catalog of 35 code elements in total that can be used to derive implicit beliefs from a program, and empirical evaluation of all of these ideas. We have analyzed over 350 millions lines of code and 7 libraries that suffer from the sparse usage problem. Our approach realizes 6 implicit beliefs and we have observed that adding single-level context sensitivity can further improve the result of usage based precondition mining.

The major pyranocoumarin isomers decursin (D) and decursinol angelate (DA), when provided at equi-molar intake to that provided by AGN extract, accounted for the inhibitory efficacy against precancerous epithelial lesions in TRAMP mice. Since we and others have shown in rodents and humans that D and DA rapidly and extensively convert to decursinol, here we tested whether decursinol might be an in vivo active compound for suppressing xenograft growth of human prostate cancer cells expressing AR. In SCID-NSG mice carrying subcutaneously inoculated human LNCaP/AR-Luc cells overexpressing the wild type AR, we compared the efficacy of 4.5[Formula: see text]mg decursinol per mouse with equi-molar dose of 6[Formula: see text]mg D/DA per mouse. The result showed that decursinol decreased xenograft tumor growth by 75% and the lung metastasis, whereas D/DA exerted a much less effect. Measurement of plasma decursinol concentration, at 3[Formula: see text]h after the last dose of respective dosing regimen, showed higher circulating level in the decursinol-treated NSG mice than in the D/DA-treated mice. In a subsequent single-dose pharmacokinetic experiment, decursinol dosing led to 3.7-fold area under curve (AUC) of plasma decursinol over that achieved by equi-molar D/DA dosing.

This vulnerability arises from deficient mesolimbic dopamine responding, which imbues psychological states (irritability, discontentment) that motivate excessive approach behavior (hyperactivity, impulsivity). Through complex interactions with (a) aversive motivational states that arise from largely independent subcortical systems, (b) emotion regulatory mechanisms that arise from top-down, cortical modulation of subcortical neural function, and (c) environmental risk factors that shape and maintain emotion dysregulation, trait impulsivity confers vulnerability to increasingly severe externalizing behaviors across development. This perspective highlights the importance of identifying transdiagnostic neural vulnerabilities to psychopathology; dovetails with the hierarchical, latent structure of psychopathology; and suggests that progression along the externalizing spectrum is an ontogenic process whereby a common, multifactorially inherited trait interacts with endogenous and exogenous influences to yield increasingly intractable externalizing behaviors across development.","https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-021815-093253",""

Materials and methods: We explore the cranial morphological affinities of three late Holocene Mexican series, in relation to ancient and modern crania from North and South America, Australo‐Melanesia, and East Asia. Morphological affinities were assessed through Mahalanobis Distances, and represented via Multidimensional Scaling and Ward's Linkage Cluster analysis. Minimum Results: Our results show Mexican groups share morphological affinities with the Native American series, but do not cluster together as would be expected. The minimum Discussion: These results show that the Mexican series share morphological affinities with the East Asian series, but maintains high levels of between‐group variation, similar to South America. This supports the suggestion that the high phenotypic variation seen the Americas is not a result of its size, as it can be found in more constricted areas, such as the Mexican territory.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fajpa.23186",""

Youth's reports of modeling of and deidentification from their mothers and fathers and three romantic relationship outcomes were assessed at Time 2. Findings revealed that higher parental marital satisfaction, lower marital conflict, and higher warmth and lower conflict in parent–adolescent relationships were associated with more modeling and less deidentification from parents. Moreover, higher deidentification was linked to a greater likelihood of youth being involved in a romantic relationship and cohabitation, whereas more modeling was linked to a lower likelihood of cohabitation and older age of first sex.

Testosterone depletion induces increased germ cell apoptosis in testes. However, limited studies exist on genes that regulate the germ cell apoptosis. Granzymes (GZM) are serine proteases that induce apoptosis in various tissues. Multiple granzymes, including GZMA, GZMB and GZMN, are present in testes. Th us, we investigated which granzyme may be testosterone responsive and possibly may have a role in germ cell apoptosis aft er testosterone depletion. Methods. Ethylene dimethane sulfonate (EDS), a toxicant that selectively ablates the Leydig cells, was injected into rats to withdraw the testosterone. The testosterone depletion effects after 7 days post-EDS were verified by replacing the testosterone exogenously into EDS-treated rats. Serum or testicular testosterone was measured by radioimmunoassay. Using qPCR, mRNAs of granzyme variants in testes were quantified. The germ cell apoptosis was identified by TUNEL assay and the localization of GZMK was by immunohistochemistry. Results. EDS treatment eliminated the Leydig cells and depleted serum and testicular testosterone. At 7 days post-EDS, testis weights were reduced 18% with increased germ cell apoptosis plus elevation GZMK expression. GZMK was not associated with TUNEL-positive cells, but was localized to stripped cytoplasm of spermatids. In addition, apoptotic round spermatids were observed in the caput epididymis. Conclusions. GZMK expression in testes is testosterone dependent. GZMK is located adjacent to germ cells in seminiferous tubules and the presence of apoptotic round spermatids in the epididymis suggest its role in the degradation of microtubules in ectoplasmic specializations. Thus, overexpression of GZMK may indirectly regulate germ cell apoptosis by premature release of round spermatids from seminiferous tubule lumen.","http://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/enr/51/4/article-p193.xml",""

With the explosive growth of unstructured content on the Web, more advanced methods for information organization and retrieval are needed to improve the intelligence and efficiency of the supplier discovery and evaluation process. In this paper, a technique for automated characterization and classification of manufacturing suppliers based on their textual portfolios was presented. A probabilistic technique that adopts Naïve Bayes method was used as the underlying mathematical model of the proposed text classifier. To improve the semantic relevance of the results, classification was conducted at the conceptual level rather than at the term level that is typically used by conventional text classifiers. The necessary steps for training data preparation and representation related to manufacturing supplier classification problem are delineated. The proposed classifier is capable of forming both simple and complex classes of manufacturing SMEs based on their advertised capabilities. The performance of the proposed classifier wass evaluated experimentally based on the standard metrics used in information retrieval such as precision, recall, and F-measure. It was concluded that the proposed concept-based classification technique outperforms the traditional term-based methods with respect to accuracy, robustness, and cost.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/smartsustainablemanufacturing/article-pdf/1/1/28/7130626/10_1520_ssms20160005.pdf",""

In five studies (total N = 815), we tested and found support for the hypothesis that moral information is inherently tied to perceived knowledge of others’ true selves. Across all studies, using both descriptive texts (Studies 1–3) and computer-generated faces as stimuli (Studies 4 and 5), participants felt that they knew more about the true selves of highly moral targets relative to other targets and, conversely, believed the targets possessed more moral traits when they felt that they knew the individual’s true self.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1948550617693061",""

The main objective of the GDIPR is to provide a simple but robust IPR solution for gas wells under transient conditions for the early and late life of gas reservoirs. Conventional IPR models are often not able to capture transient effects for the late life of gas reservoirs. The GDIPR solution, on the other hand, can be used for the cases of buildup and drawdown tests (early life), and for the modeling of transient liquid loading phenomena in gas wells (late life). The GDIPR is compared to conventional IPR models in two case studies. The comparison analysis show that the conventional IPR models do not provide reliable results, while the GDIPR is in agreement with the solution from discretized reservoir models. The GDIPR technique is computationally less expensive than discretized reservoir models, and is able to capture both the transient well behavior and the steady-state solution, for early and late life of gas reservoirs.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/OMAE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/OMAE2017-62459/2534236/v008t11a051-omae2017-62459.pdf",""

The therapy provided represented business-as-usual speech/language treatment provided by speech-language pathologists in the public schools. Method: The sample included 272 kindergartners and first-graders with language impairment who participated in a larger study titled “Speech-Therapy Experiences in the Public Schools.” Multilevel regression analyses were applied to examine the extent to which select child-level characteristics, including age, nonverbal cognition, memory, phonological awareness, vocabulary, behavior problems, and self-regulation, predicted children's language gains over an academic year. Pratt indices were computed to establish the relative importance of the predictors of interest. Results: Phonological awareness and vocabulary skill related to greater gains in language skills, and together they accounted for nearly 70% of the explained variance, or 10% of total variance at child level. Externalizing behavior, nonverbal cognition, and age were also potentially important predictors of language gains. Conclusions: This study significantly advances our understanding of the characteristics of children that may contribute to their language gains while receiving therapy in the public schools. Researchers can explore how these characteristics may serve to moderate treatment outcomes, whereas clinicians can assess how these characteristics may factor into understanding treatment responses.","http://pubs.asha.org/doi/pdf/10.1044/2016_JSLHR-L-16-0026",""

The simulation trajectories were calculated with a combined M06-2X/MP2 algorithm utilizing the 6-311++G** basis set. The experiments were performed at 300 K, and assuming the accuracy of transition state theory (TST), the trajectories were initiated at the F⋯HCH2CN abstraction TS with a 300 K Boltzmann distribution of energy and directed towards products. Recrossing of the TS was negligible, confirming the accuracy of TST. HF formation was rapid, occurring within 0.014 ps of the trajectory initiation. The intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) for reaction involves rotation of HF about CH2CN and then trapping in the CH2CN⋯HF post-reaction potential energy well of ∼10 kcal/mol with respect to the HF + CH2CN products. In contrast to this IRC, five different trajectory types were observed: the majority proceeded by direct H-atom transfer and only 11% approximately following the IRC. The HF vibrational and rotational quantum numbers, n and J, were calculated when HF was initially formed and they increase as potential energy is released in forming the HF + CH2CN products. The population of the HF product vibrational states is only in qualitative agreement with experiment, with the simulations showing depressed and enhanced populations of the n = 1 and 2 states as compared to experiment. Simulations with an anharmonic zero-point energy constraint gave product distributions for relative translation, HF rotation, HF vibration, CH2CN rotation, and CH2CN vibration as 5%, 11%, 60%, 7%, and 16%, respectively. In contrast, the experimental energy partitioning percentages to HF rotation and vibration are 6% and 41%. Comparisons are made between the current simulation and those for other F + H-atom abstraction reactions. The simulation product energy partitioning and HF vibrational population for F + CH3CN → HF + CH2CN resemble those for other reactions. A detailed discussion is given of possible origins of the difference between the simulation and experimental energy partitioning dynamics for F + CH3CN → HF + CH2CN. The F + CH3CN reaction also forms the CH3C(F)N intermediate, in which the F-atom adds to the C≡N bond. However, this intermediate and F⋯CH3CN and CH3CN⋯F van der Waals complexes are not expected to affect the F + CH3CN → HF + CH2CN product energy partitioning.","http://aip.scitation.org/doi/am-pdf/10.1063/1.4985894",""

This was a qualitative study that applied a phenomenological approach and information was collected from 24 officers through the use of semistructured interviews. The predominant organizational events linked to fairness assessments among participants included disciplinary actions, citizen complaints, blocked career aspirations, and officer–supervisor conflicts. Overwhelmingly, officers reported these events made them feel angry. These events fostered feelings of increased skepticism and not being supported or feeling expendable. Analyses of data revealed two salient forms of negative work outcomes as responses to perceived organizational injustice: production deviance and self-protective behaviors. This study expands our understanding of which events foster negative perceptions of injustice while exposing how police officers react to those experiences.

Anxiety sensitivity (AS; ie, fear of anxiety‐related symptoms) is positively related to coping motives for cannabis use (which are robustly positively linked to cannabis‐related problems). However, AS is unrelated to cannabis use‐related problems. Yet, extant studies have been conducted on primarily White samples. It may be that among Black students, AS‐physical concerns (ie, fear of physical anxiety‐related sensations) are related to cannabis problems given that Black individuals are more likely than White individuals to report experiencing greater and more intense somatic symptoms when experiencing anxiety. Black individuals may rely on cannabis to cope with fear of these somatic symptoms, continuing to use despite cannabis‐related problems. Methods: The current study tested whether race moderated the relation between AS‐physical concerns and cannabis problems among 102 (85.3% female) current cannabis using undergraduates who were either non‐Hispanic Black ( Results: After controlling for frequency of cannabis use, income, and gender, race significantly moderated the relation between AS‐physical concerns and cannabis use‐related problems such that AS‐physical concerns significantly predicted cannabis‐related problems among Black and not White individuals. Discussion and Conclusions: Findings highlight the importance of considering race in identifying psychosocial predictors of cannabis‐related problems. Scientific Significance: Intervention strategies for Black cannabis users may benefit from examining and targeting AS‐physical concerns.

Moses argues that Charles Sanders Peirce's article “Evolutionary Love” establishes a general normative framework for a logic of evolutionary, progressive imagination that can be used to elucidate an evolutionary continuity between the normative works of Jane Addams, John Dewey, and Alain Locke. This exercise contributes to an understanding of pragmatism as a philosophy that seizes insights from evolution in order to normatively reconstruct dynamic meanings of truth, reality, ethics, politics, and art. In a dynamic model of progressive evolution — one homologous to the Golden Rule of “love your neighbor” — we find a normative cosmology that animates the moral imagination of philosophy toward what Addams called “democracy and social ethics.” Moses concludes that in the Peircean model, together with subsequent developments, we may ultimately apprehend that evolution suggests a general form of development that may be hypothesized as a worthy normative guide for universal progressive education.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fedth.12282",""

Diffusion of dissolved methane in marine gas hydrate systems has been proposed as a potential transport mechanism through which large concentrations of hydrate can preferentially accumulate in coarse‐grained sediments over geologic time. Using one‐dimensional compositional reservoir simulations, we examine hydrate distribution patterns at the scale of individual sand layers (1–20 m thick) that are deposited between microbially active fine‐grained material buried through the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ). We then extrapolate to two‐dimensional and basin‐scale three‐dimensional simulations, where we model dipping sands and multilayered systems. We find that properties of a sand layer including pore size distribution, layer thickness, dip, and proximity to other layers in multilayered systems all exert control on diffusive methane fluxes toward and within a sand, which in turn impact the distribution of hydrate throughout a sand unit. In all of these simulations, we incorporate data on physical properties and sand layer geometries from the Terrebonne Basin gas hydrate system in the Gulf of Mexico. We demonstrate that diffusion can generate high hydrate saturations (upward of 90%) at the edges of thin sands at shallow depths within the GHSZ, but that it is ineffective at producing high hydrate saturations throughout thick (greater than 10 m) sands buried deep within the GHSZ. Furthermore, we find that hydrate in fine‐grained material can preserve high hydrate saturations in nearby thin sands with burial.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2F2016GC006662",""

This research explored whether with high visibility in EDs, teamwork and collaborative communication can be improved while the security issues will be reduced. Visibility has been regarded as a critical design consideration and can be directly and considerably impacted by ED’s physical design. Teamwork is one of the major related operational outcomes of visibility and involves nurses, support staff, and physicians. The collaborative communication in an ED is another important factor in the process of care delivery and affects efficiency and safety. Furthermore, security is a behavioral factor in ED designs, which includes all types of safety including staff safety, patient safety, and the safety of visitors and family members. This qualitative study investigated the impact of visibility on teamwork, collaborative communication, and security issues in the ED. One-on-one interviews and on-site observation sessions were conducted in a community hospital. Corresponding data analysis was implemented by using computer plan analysis, observation and interview content, and theme analyses. The findings of this exploratory study provided a framework to identify visibility as an influential factor in ED design. High levels of visibility impact productivity and efficiency of teamwork and communication and improve the chance of lowering security issues. The findings of this study also contribute to the general body of knowledge about the effect of physical design on teamwork, collaborative communication, and security.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1937586717735290",""

Crescent formation requires a group of proteins that are highly conserved among poxviruses, including A6 and A11 of vaccinia virus (VACV). To gain a better understanding of the molecular function of A6, we established a HeLa cell line that inducibly expressed VACV-A6, which allowed us to construct VACV mutants with an A6 deletion or mutation. As expected, the A6 deletion mutant of VACV failed to replicate in noncomplementing cell lines with defects in crescent formation and A11 localization. Surprisingly, a VACV mutant that had A6 replaced with a close ortholog from the Yaba-like disease virus YLDV-97 also failed to replicate. This mutant, however, developed crescents and had normal A11 localization despite failing to form immature virions. Limited proteolysis of the recombinant A6 protein identified an N domain and a C domain of approximately 121 and 251 residues, respectively. Various chimeras of VACV-A6 and YLDV-97 were constructed, but only one that precisely combined the N domain of VACV-A6 and the C domain of YLDV-97 supported VACV replication albeit at a reduced efficiency. Our results show that VACV-A6 has a two-domain architecture and functions in both crescent formation and its enclosure to form immature virions. While a cognate N domain is not required for crescent formation, it is required for virion formation, suggesting that interactions of the N domain with cognate viral proteins may be critical for virion assembly.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.02405-16",""

Recycling in Laramie began in 1983 with the establishment of the Ark Recycling Center. Laramie officially started its curbside recycling services in September 2011, and in April 2012 the city declared its long-term goal to achieve a 40% diversion rate by 2030. The study involved a mail-back survey to understand the public participation landscape and the factors affecting recycling behaviors and attitudes of residents in Laramie. The quantitative results of the survey responses were used to create a civic engagement score, a recycling importance score, and recycling satisfaction and recycling behavior scores to measure residents’ perceptions of the recycling program. In addition, three key informant interviews were conducted to explore the efforts of the city, the University of Wyoming, and Ark Regional Services. The results show that more than 80% of the survey respondents indicated that environmental concern was the major motivation to recycle, which was related to a high level of recycling importance and satisfaction. The study further indicated that Laramie should develop an aggressive educational policy, incentive policies, and a Master Plan to encourage stronger public participation to meet its 40% waste diversion rate by 2030 goal.","https://www.mdpi.com/2313-4321/2/3/11/pdf",""

Others have suggested that the ray deficiency is in the central portion of the midfoot and forefoot. Methods:: We identified all patients with a clinical morphologic diagnosis of congenital fibular deficiency at our institution over a 15-year period. We reviewed the records and radiographs of patients who had radiographs of the feet to allow determination of the number of metatarsals, the presence or absence of a cuboid or calcaneocuboid fusion, the number of cuneiforms present (if possible), and any other osseous abnormalities of the foot. We excluded patients with 5-rayed feet, those who had not had radiographs of the feet, or whose radiographs were not adequate to allow accurate assessment of these radiographic features. We defined the characteristic “lateral (fifth) ray present” if there was a well-developed cuboid or calcaneocuboid coalition with which the lateral-most preserved metatarsal articulated. Results:: Twenty-six patients with 28 affected feet met radiographic criteria for inclusion in the study. All affected feet had a well-developed cuboid or calcaneocuboid coalition. The lateral-most ray of 25 patients with 26 affected feet articulated with the cuboid or calcaneocuboid coalition. One patient with bilateral fibular deficiency had bilateral partially deficient cuboids, and the lateral-most metatarsal articulated with the medial remnant of the deformed cuboids. Twenty-one of 28 feet with visible cuneiforms had 2 or 1 cuneiform. Conclusions:: Although the embryology and pathogenesis of congenital fibular deficiency remain unknown, based on the radiographic features of the feet in this study, congenital fibular deficiency should not be viewed as a global “lateral lower-limb deficiency” nor the foot ray deficiency as “lateral.” Level of Evidence:: Level IV—prognostic study.","https://journals.lww.com/01241398-201707000-00013",""

Weighted estimates, trend analyses and analytic models were conducted using the 1998-2016 National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS) and the 2014 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Compared with working-age adults without disabilities, those with disabilities are less likely to work, more likely to earn below the federal poverty level, and more likely to use public insurance. Average health costs for this population are 3 to 7 times higher, and access problems are far more common.

The approach estimates the mean and standard deviations as weighted linear combinations of quantile judgments, where the weights are explicit functions of the expert’s judgmental errors. The approach is analytically tractable, and provides flexibility to elicit any set of quantiles from an expert. The approach also establishes that using an expert’s quantile judgments to deduce the distribution parameters is equivalent to collecting data with a specific sample size and enables combining the expert’s judgments with those of other experts. It also shows analytically that the weights for the mean add up to one and the weights for the standard deviation add up to zero—these properties have been observed numerically in the literature in the last 30 years, but without a systematic explanation. The theory has been in use at Dow AgroSciences for two years for making an annual decision worth $800 million. The use of the approach has resulted in the following monetary benefits: (i) firm’s annual production investment has reduced by 6%–7% and (ii) profit has increased by 2%–3%. We discuss the implementation at the firm, and provide practical guidelines for using expert judgment for operational uncertainties in industrial settings.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/opre.2017.1627",""

The fair value estimation process is subject to verifiability concerns when market prices are unavailable and, thus, susceptible to managerial discretion. We explore whether banks' exposure to less-verifiable fair value estimates is associated with conditional conservatism. General and bank-specific conservatism measures indicate that banks with greater proportions of less-verifiable fair value assets exhibit more conditional conservatism. Cross-sectional analyses provide evidence that this relation varies predictably with investor-demand and manager-supply proxies. Further analyses indicate that monitoring institutional investors drive the demand for conservatism. We identify high-quality auditors and board independence as two mechanisms used to invoke conservatism. Findings are robust to the exclusion of fair value earnings components, suggesting that the effect is not confined to fair value accounts. Together, our results indicate that less-verifiable fair value estimates generate demand for conditional conservatism in the financial industry.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article-pdf/93/5/119/37552/accr-51963.pdf",""

A large proportion of ADV-1 targets were found to be light- and/or clock-controlled, and enriched for genes involved in development, metabolism, cell growth, and cell fusion. We show that ADV-1 is necessary for transducing light and/or temporal information to its immediate downstream targets, including controlling rhythms in genes critical to somatic cell fusion. However, while ADV-1 targets are altered in predictable ways in Δadv-1 cells in response to light, this is not always the case for rhythmic target gene expression. These data suggest that a complex regulatory network downstream of ADV-1 functions to generate distinct temporal dynamics of target gene expression relative to the central clock mechanism.","http://academic.oup.com/g3journal/article-pdf/7/1/129/37148183/g3journal0129.pdf",""

We developed a two‐dimensional coupled flow, reactive transport model to study the role of bank storage induced by river fluctuations on removing river‐borne nitrate. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to quantify the effects of river amplitude, sediment hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity, and ambient groundwater flow on nitrate removal rate. The simulations showed that nitrification occurred in the shallower zone adjacent to the bank where oxic river water and groundwater interacted while denitrification occurred deeper into the aquifer and in the riverbed sediments where oxygen was depleted. River fluctuations greatly increased the amount of nitrate being removed; the nitrate removal rate increased as river amplitude increased. Similarly, increasing hydraulic conductivity increased overall nitrate removal since it expanded the denitrifying zone but decreased efficiency. In contrast, increasing sediment dispersivity increased the removal efficiency of nitrate because it promoted mixing between electron acceptors and donors. The presence and direction of ambient groundwater flow had a significant impact on nitrate removal rate when compared to neutral conditions. A losing river showed a larger nitrate removal rate, whereas a gaining river showed a smaller nitrate removal rate. Our results demonstrated that daily river fluctuations created denitrification hot spots within the RZ that would not otherwise exist under naturally neutral or gaining conditions.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2F2017WR020610",""

The debate, I believe, has not been settled. I deny that the existentialist‐inspired charge of representationalism about perception in Husserl is precise enough to stick. Given a clearer understanding of just what mental representation amounts to, I contend that those who defend Husserl against the accusation of representationalism fare little better than Husserl's existentialist‐leaning critics. I argue that he is in fact a representationalist about perception insofar as it involves a noematic sense. Nevertheless, Husserl opens up the possibility for a representation‐free form of perceiving in certain later discussions of the matter in which he suggests that some perceptual states lack noematic sense. What they lack in noematic sense is compensated for by other means, namely, by two sorts of affect and their functional interrelation with abilities for bodily movement. The texts that entertain this possibility, though, severely limit the scope of its actual occurrence. Husserl never commits to a generally or substantially nonrepresentational view of perception. I attempt to sketch out, however, what this nonrepresentationalism about perception that Husserl nearly landed on might look like, rearranging various more or less familiar elements already present in his theory of perception to that end.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fejop.12261",""

Although several epidemiological studies and clinical trials in aged individuals have pointed to a relationship between lutein status and cognitive health, mechanisms of selective lutein (and zeaxanthin) brain uptake and potential functions of lutein in early neurodevelopment and cognitive health remain poorly understood. The objective of this study is to demonstrate if a rat model of maternal and neonatal lutein supplementation can be used to interrogate maternal/fetal and milk‐to‐pup lutein uptake and brain accumulation. The model is a clinically relevant and validated simulation of human neonatal hypoxic‐ischemic (HI) brain injury. Methods: The rat HI model consists of left carotid artery ligation on postnatal day 7 (P7) and subsequent exposure to 8% O Results: Maternal dietary supplementation with lutein significantly increased lutein content in milk (~100–250 pmol/g rat milk coagulates). Maternal and neonatal lutein supplementation yielded P10 brain lutein accumulation (~12–15 pmol/g wet wt), concentrations similar in magnitude to brain lutein accumulation in other species investigated. In the absence of maternal lutein supplementation, lutein was not detectable in brain samples. When neonatal rats received dietary lutein via suckling and were additionally treated with daily i.p. injections of lutein in oil vehicle, brain lutein content was even higher than when pups received lutein only via dietary (milk) intake. In preliminary experiments, brain lutein accumulation was slightly enhanced when pups were recovering from HI brain injury. In parallel analyses, maternal lutein supplementation during gestation and lactation suppressed consequences of neonatal (P7) HI brain injury including histological injury scores, neuroinflammation, hypoxic stress pathways, and neuronal apoptosis/necrosis. Conclusion: These investigations demonstrate for the first time that at least some rodent species (here, rats) are suitable for studying maternal/fetal and neonatal dietary (milk) delivery of lutein. When dams are supplemented with dietary lutein in pregnancy and during nursing, lutein is transferred, presumably in utero, and via milk. Ingested (and injected) lutein reaches and accumulates in the developing rodent brain. This rat and, potentially, genetically manipulated mouse models, offer numerous experimental advantages for studying carotenoid effects on recovery from brain injury, other brain disorders, and behavior.","",""

We recently reported that the E3-ubiquitin ligase TRIM6 catalyzes the synthesis of unanchored K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, which are not covalently attached to any protein, and activate IKKɛ for induction of IFN-I mediated antiviral responses. The importance of TRIM6 as an antiviral factor is highlighted by our findings that the highly pathogenic Nipah virus (NiV; Paramyxoviridae family) can inhibit IFN-I responses by targeting TRIM6. To overcome this antiviral pathway, the matrix protein of NiV promotes TRIM6 degradation, resulting in reduced levels of unanchored K48-linked polyubiquitin chains associated with IKKɛ, which in turn leads to impaired IKKɛ activation. In contrast, Ebola virus (EBOV; Filoviridae family), which antagonizes IFN-I responses via its VP35 protein, also hijacks TRIM6 to enhance its own replication, but does it primarily by directly promoting virus replication. Our data show that EBOV-VP35 is ubiquitinated by TRIM6 and promotes VP35-dependent polymerase activity. In line with these results, TRIM6-knockout cell lines and cells derived from our newly generated TRIM6−/− mouse exhibit reduced EBOV replication, even in the absence of IFN-I production. This is the first evidence indicating that TRIM6 represents a major antiviral host factor that is targeted by different viruses to promote their own replication.","https://journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article/198/1_Supplement/148.20/58732/The-highly-pathogenic-Ebola-and-Nipah-viruses",""

Methods: Descriptive analysis summarized information on deaths reported during the 16-year period—cause of death, type of treatment (index or maintenance) and patient demographics. Multiple logistic regression of death incidence by treatment session was performed to determine whether patient age, sex, race, diagnosis, or year of treatment was associated with death after ECT. Results: Of those deaths occurring within 1 day of an ECT treatment, the death rate was 2.4 per 100,000 treatments. Looking at all deaths within 14 days of an ECT treatment, the death rate increased to 18 per 100,000 treatments but included all deaths regardless of likelihood of causal association with ECT, for example, accidents and suicides, the latter a leading cause of death among individuals with severe major depression or other disorders for which ECT is indicated.

The elevated temperature can cause thermal damages to the surrounding tissues. In order to minimize these damages, it is critical to understand how the tissue properties change and how that affects the thermal spread. This study used porcine aorta arterial tissue to investigate tissue thermal conductivity with variable thermal dose. Seven joining times (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, and 6 seconds) were used to create different amounts of thermal dose. A hybrid method that uses both experimental measurement and inverse heat transfer analysis was conducted to determine the thermal conductivity of thin tissue samples. In general, the tissue thermal conductivity decreases when thermal dose increases. Accordingly, 36% decrease in tissue thermal conductivity was found when the thermal dose reaches the threshold for second-degree burn (with 2-second joining time). When thermal dose is beyond the threshold of third-degree burn, the tissue thermal conductivity does not decrease significantly. A regression model was also developed and can be used to predict tissue thermal conductivity based on the thermal dose.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/MSEC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/MSEC2017-2944/2519551/v004t05a005-msec2017-2944.pdf",""

Measurements: Participants were asked whether they had insurance that covered the cost of any dental visit, how they would rate their overall oral health status, and whether they had visited a dental clinic for a routine examination in the past 12 months. Information was also collected on sociodemographic and immigration‐related variables. Results: More than 61% of the sample had no dental health insurance, 45% reported that their oral health was fair or poor, and 44% had not used preventive dental care services. A series of logistic regression analyses identified factors posing a significant risk to oral health and dental care. For example, those with limited English proficiency were 3.5 times as likely to lack dental health insurance and 3.2 times as likely to rate their oral health as fair or poor. The odds of not using preventive dental care services were 6.4 times as great in those without dental health insurance. Conclusion: The overall findings call attention to efforts to promote oral health and dental care in older Asian Americans.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fjgs.14832",""

This study explores the association between categories of obesity with treatment times and mortality for patients experiencing ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction. Methods and Results: We examined 8725 patients with ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention and used regression models to analyze the relationship between 6 categories of body mass index with key door‐to‐balloon time, total ischemic time, and in‐hospital mortality. We relied on data from the Mission: Lifeline North Texas program, consisting of 33 percutaneous coronary intervention–capable hospitals in 6 counties surrounding Dallas, Texas. Data were extracted from the National Cardiovascular Data Registry for each participating hospital. Of the samples, 76% were overweight or obese. Comparing the univariate differences between the normal‐weight group and the pooled sample, we observed a U‐shaped association between body mass index and both mortality and door‐to‐balloon times. The most underweight and severely obese had the highest mortality and median door‐to‐balloon time, respectively. These differences persisted after multivariate adjustments for door‐to‐balloon time, but not for mortality. Conclusions: Extremely obese patients have longer treatment time delays than other body mass index categories. However, this did not extend to significant differences in mortality in the multivariate models. We conclude that clinicians should incorporate body mass assessments into their diagnosis and treatment plans to mitigate observed disparities.","https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/JAHA.117.005827",""

We know little about the psychological well-being of women who report abuse to police departments. This study used data from case records of women who experience IPV and sought help from a city police station located in the southwest United States. These case records were examined to identify how sociodemographic characteristics of age, ethnicity, marital status, financial dependence, resources of social support, and coping strategies related with type and number of IPV incidents as well as mental health symptoms. The sample consisted of 154 women, majority of whom experienced physical violence (70.1%), sexual violence (9.1%), emotional violence/stalking (14.9%), and combined, that is, reporting more than one (5.8%). Approximately 67.5% of the women reported some mental health symptoms. Social support and coping strategies significantly distinguished women’s experience of mental health symptoms. Unexpectedly, the current data indicate that women who scored higher in perceived social support significantly reported more mental health symptoms. Coping strategies mediated the relationship between IPV and mental health symptoms. The findings suggest that availability of coping resources may mitigate repeated IPV and modify the impact of mental health. In discussing prevention and intervention efforts with women who have experienced or are at risk of experiencing IPV, practitioners can help women employ empowering coping strategies that are built on their resilience. In addition, mental health professionals working with the police, especially in community policing setting, can achieve promising outcomes for women experiencing violence.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0886260517729402",""

Method. Secondary analyses were conducted on cross-sectional data from The Geographic Research on Wellbeing (GROW) study. GROW includes survey data from a diverse sample of 2,750 California mothers. Structural equation modeling was used to test a conceptual multilevel mediation model, proposing social cohesion as a mediator of known predictors of PA. Results. Social cohesion fully mediated the pathway from perceived neighborhood safety to mothers’ PA. Social cohesion also mediated the significant relationship between neighborhood SES and PA; however, this mediation finding was not practically significant when considered in the context of the full model. Household SES was significantly positively related to both social cohesion and PA. Park access contributed significantly to social cohesion but not directly to PA Social cohesion did not significantly mediate relationships between park access or household SES and PA. Conclusions. There is a need for public health interventions to improve engagement in PA among individuals and neighborhoods with lower levels of socioeconomic resources.

Despite the clinical importance, the temporal dynamics of pathological cardiac growth remain elusive. Here, we took advantage of the puromycin labeling approach to measure the relative rates of protein synthesis as a way to delineate the temporal regulation of cardiac hypertrophic growth. We first identified the optimal treatment conditions for puromycin in neonatal rat ventricular myocyte culture. We went on to demonstrate that myocyte growth reached its peak rate after 8–10 h of growth stimulation. At the in vivo level, with the use of an acute surgical model of pressure-overload stress, we observed the maximal growth rate to occur at day 7 after surgery. Moreover, RNA sequencing analysis supports that the most profound transcriptomic changes occur during the early phase of hypertrophic growth. Our results therefore suggest that cardiac myocytes mount an immediate growth response in reply to pressure overload followed by a gradual return to basal levels of protein synthesis, highlighting the temporal dynamics of pathological cardiac hypertrophic growth.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpheart.00284.2017",""

The V3 loop of the gp120 component of the Env trimer contributes to the coreceptor binding site and is a target for neutralizing antibodies. We used cryo-electron tomography to visualize the binding of CD4 and the V3 loop monoclonal antibody (MAb) 36D5 to gp120 of the SIV Env trimer. Our results show that 36D5 binds gp120 at the base of the V3 loop and suggest that the antibody exerts its neutralization effect by blocking the coreceptor binding site. The antibody does this without altering the dynamics of the spike motion between closed and open states when CD4 is bound. The interaction between 36D5 and SIV gp120 is similar to the interaction between some broadly neutralizing anti-V3 loop antibodies and HIV-1 gp120. Two conformations of gp120 bound with CD4 are revealed, suggesting an intrinsic dynamic nature of the liganded Env trimer. CD4 binding substantially increases the binding of 36D5 to gp120 in the intact Env trimer, consistent with CD4-induced changes in the conformation of gp120 and the antibody binding site. Binding by MAb 36D5 does not substantially alter the proportions of the two CD4-bound conformations.

While a few studies have documented student voice in reform resistance, none have documented the voice of a student with a dis/ability. Objective: Using a theoretical framework that weaves together self-determination theory and resiliency theory, the study seeks to understand the motivation and the conditions for that motivation driving a student to take action and the potential role of young people in current educational reform. Setting: The study takes place in a large, urban city in central Texas. The high school slated for closure is in a poor, minority neighborhood and has been the subject of various reform efforts over the last two decades. Population: As a single case study, the sole subject is EJ, a young black male with a dis/ability. EJ is the president of his student body and a leader in the reform resistance for his school. Research Design: This case study is qualitative and uses narrative inquiry to document the story of EJ over a two-year period, following his initial involvement in reform resistance at his school to his key role as student body president during a volatile year of reform decisions by his school district. Data Collection and Analysis: The study relies on data collected as part of a larger study examining the impact of school turnaround efforts on students with dis/abilities. Centering on the personal accounts of EJ and his own description of what occurred at his school and his leadership role, his narrative in analyzed through the theoretical lens of self-determination and resiliency theory. Data from the larger study is used to triangulate EJ's account. Findings: The study finds that students, and particularly students historically marginalized in school settings, can be extremely effective voices for change. Conclusions: The paper concludes with implications for accountability reform and a discussion of the potential of expanding approaches of student engagement in reform efforts to include student voice, particularly, the voices of students with dis/abilities. There's a lot of good things going on at this school and we just want people to understand that we're coming, we're coming, a change is going to come. Just like the song says. And it might not be tomorrow, it might not be the next day, but HHS is going to be known. We're going to make sure HHS is known—for something.

In this study, the feasibility of a crystalline oxide passivation on In0.53Ga0.47As (100) is demonstrated experimentally. The (3 × 1) and (3 × 2) crystalline oxide reconstructions are formed on the de-capped In0.53Ga0.47As (100) surfaces through the control of the surface oxidation states. By monitoring the evolution of chemical states and associated structures of the In0.53Ga0.47As (100) surfaces upon O2 and subsequent atomic hydrogen exposure, we find that the control of the Ga oxide states is critical to the formation of the crystalline oxide reconstructions. The stability of the crystalline oxide layers upon the atomic layer deposition of HfO2 is investigated as well. Furthermore, the capacitance voltage behavior of metal oxide semiconductor capacitors with an HfO2 dielectric layer reveals that the crystalline oxide reconstructions result in a decrease in the density of interface traps (Dit) from ∼1 × 1013 cm−2 eV−1 to ∼1 × 1012 cm−2 eV−1 compared with the de-capped surface. The crystalline oxide passivation offers a platform to develop In0.53Ga0.47As devices with a low density of interface states.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.4979202/13571019/125302_1_online.pdf",""

We study the effect of the area fraction, the viscosity contrast between the inside (the vesicles) and the outside (the bulk) fluid, the initial condition of the solute, and the mixing metric. We compare mixing in the suspension with mixing in the Couette apparatus without vesicles. On the one hand, the presence of vesicles in most cases slightly suppresses mixing. This is because the solute can be only diffused across the vesicle interface and not advected. On the other hand, there exist spatial distributions of the solute for which the unperturbed Couette flow completely fails to mix whereas the presence of vesicles enables mixing. We derive a simple condition that relates the velocity and solute and can be used to characterize the cases in which the presence of vesicles promotes mixing.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.4975154/14938788/021901_1_online.pdf",""

We develop learning models to estimate adequate privacy settings for newly uploaded images, based on carefully selected image-specific features. Our study investigates both visual and textual features of images for privacy classification. We consider both basic image-specific features, commonly used for image processing, as well as more sophisticated and abstract visual features. Additionally, we include a visual representation of the sentiment evoked by images. To our knowledge, sentiment has never been used in the context of image classification for privacy purposes. We identify the smallest set of features, that by themselves or combined together with others, can perform well in properly predicting the degree of sensitivity of users’ images. We consider both the case of binary privacy settings (i.e., public, private), as well as the case of more complex privacy options, characterized by multiple sharing options.

Transit-accessible housing allows disadvantaged populations to reduce their reliance on automobiles, which can lead to savings on transportation-related expenditures. The housing location model developed here maximizes transit accessibility while reducing the clustering of affordable housing units in space. Accessibility is maximized using a high-resolution space-time metric of public transit accessibility, originally developed for service equity analysis. The second objective disperses subsidized housing projects across space using a new minimax dispersion model based on spatial interaction principles. The multiobjective model trades off accessibility maximization and affordable housing dispersion, subject to upper and lower bounds on the land acquisition and construction budget. The model is tested using data for Tempe, AZ including actual data for vacant parcels, travel times by light rail and bus, and the location of low-wage jobs. This model or similar variants could provide insightful spatial decision support to affordable-housing providers or tax-credit administrators, facilitating the design of flexible strategies that address multiple social goals.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2399808317719708",""

Using a structural equation modeling approach with self-report data from a sample of college students, the present study tests the extent to which SLT can effectively explain and predict IPV victimization and the degree, if any, to which the social learning model is gender invariant. Although our findings are largely supportive of SLT and, thus, affirm its extension to victimization as well as perpetration, the findings are also somewhat mixed.

METHODS: Eight male high school taekwondo athletes participated in this study. The head impact characteristics were recorded by X-Patch, a wireless accelerometer and gyroscope, during 6 taekwondo sparring sessions. The outcome measures were the peak linear acceleration ( RESULTS: A total of 689 impacts occurred over 6 sessions involving the 8 athletes. There was an average of 24 impacts per 100 minutes, and there were significant differences in the frequency of impacts among both the sessions and individual athletes. In order of frequency, the most commonly hit locations were the side (38.2%), back (35.7%), and front (23.8%) of the head. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that there is a relatively high number of head impacts experienced by taekwondo athletes during sparring practice.

The effect of leucine ingestion on muscle breakdown following resistance exercise (RE) is less understood. The purpose of this study was to identify the impact of postexercise leucine ingestion on the ubiquitin proteasome and autophagosomal-lysosomal systems following acute RE in older men. Subjects (72 ± 2 yr) performed RE and 1 h postexercise ingested 10 g of EAA containing a leucine quantity similar to quality protein (control, 1.8 g leucine, n = 7) or enriched in leucine (leucine, 3.5 g leucine, n = 8). Stable isotope infusion and muscle biopsies (vastus lateralis) obtained at rest and 2, 5, and 24 h postexercise were used to examine protein content (Western blot), mRNA expression (RT-quantitative PCR), and muscle protein fractional breakdown rate (FBR). Muscle-specific RING finger 1 mRNA increased in both groups at 2 and 5 h ( P < 0.05). LC3 mRNA increased, and the LC3BII-to-LC3BI ratio decreased at all postexercise time points in control ( P < 0.05). Conversely, LC3 mRNA only increased at 2 h, and the LC3BII-to-LC3BI ratio only decreased at 2 and 5 h in leucine ( P < 0.05). Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-6 mRNA increased ( P < 0.05) in control at 5 h. FBR was not statistically different between groups or from basal 24 h postexercise ( P > 0.05).

We argue that auditors leverage the client's ERM system at the application level to create audit efficiencies beyond those created by strong internal controls. Using a Heckman two-stage analysis for our sample of insurance/reinsurance firms rated on ERM quality by Standard & Poor's, we find results consistent with our expectations that higher-quality ERM systems incrementally reduce audit fees, audit delay, and the likelihood of late filing. However, we find that this association is nonlinear and that much of the assurance benefit from ERM systems is captured when firms improve their ratings from Weak to Adequate.","https://publications.aaahq.org/ajpt/article-pdf/37/3/25/49631/ajpt-51900.pdf",""

Analyses used sequential design-based logistic regression for DSM-IV ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition) opioid dependence correlates, followed by Cox regression of proportional hazards for correlates (e.g., sociodemographics, age of NMUPO initiation, and psychopathology) of time to dependence in those who developed DSM-IV dependence. Results: Earlier age of NMUPO initiation increased OUD odds (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.94–0.96) but slowed OUD development (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.04–1.06) in those who developed OUD ( n = 118), after controlling for sociodemographics, psychopathology, and ages of other drug use initiation. Psychopathology and earlier other drug use initiation were associated with higher OUD odds, but only having an alcohol use disorder was associated with shorter time to OUD. Conclusions: Earlier NMUPO initiation is associated with increased odds of OUD, although those with early initiation had a slower progression to OUD. Programs that prevent early NMUPO initiation, which might lower rates of OUD, and/or identify the later initiators at highest risk for rapid OUD development could have great public health benefits.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/08897077.2017.1356791",""

Its occurrence in the trachea is predominantly localized to the soft mucous tissue that forms the innermost tracheal layer. The biomechanical consequences, such as airway constriction, are dependent upon the ensuing mechanical interactions between all of the various tissues that comprise the tracheal tube. We model the stress interactions by treating the trachea organ as a three‐tissue system consisting of swellable mucous in conjunction with nonswelling cartilage and nonswelling trachealis musculature. Hyperelastic constitutive modeling is used by generalizing the standard anisotropic, incompressible soft tissue framework to incorporate the swelling effect. Finite element stress analysis then proceeds with swelling of the mucous layer providing the driving factor for the mechanical analysis. The amount of airway constriction is governed by the mechanical interaction between the three predominant tissue types. The detailed stress analysis indicates the presence of stress concentrations near the various tissue junctions. Because of the tissue's nonlinear mechanical behavior, this can lead to material stiffness fluctuations as a function of location on the trachea. Patient specific modeling is presented. The role of the modeling in the interpretation of diagnostic procedures and the assessment of therapies is discussed.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fcnm.2861",""

The OAP is a research‐education consortium seeking solutions from problems arising from declining water availability from the Ogallala Aquifer in western Kansas and the Texas High Plains. The consortium is led by the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) laboratories in Bushland and Lubbock, TX, and the university partners are Kansas State University, Texas A&M AgriLife Research and Extension Service, Texas Tech University, and West Texas A&M University. The OAP has provided over $40 million to support research and education activities. About half of these funds were used to support permanent ARS scientists and ARS hired post‐docs. The other half were used by university scientists to supplement on‐going projects by providing support for supplies, sample analyses, temporary employees, etc. Initially, OAP activities were focused on seven priorities. In 2013, four objectives replaced the original seven priorities. A fifth priority was added in 2017. The current objectives are: 1) Develop and evaluate water management strategies and technologies that could reduce water withdrawals for irrigation by 20% in 2020 compared to 2012; 2) Develop and evaluate management strategies and technologies that would increase the productivity and profitability of dryland cropping systems; 3) Improve the understanding of hydrological and climatic factors that affect water use and agricultural profitability; 4) Determine the impacts of alternative water withdrawal/use policies on the economic viability of the agriculture industry of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer Region; and 5) Develop best management practices for production of high value and alternative crops for both dryland and irrigated systems. The objectives of the program and distribution of resources are decided by an executive committee with a member from each of the four universities, two from ARS, one from Bushland, and the other from Lubbock. Proposed projects that utilize resources from more than one participating institution, leverage existing resources, and address the stated objectives are more likely to be provided support. The impact of the OAP on research directed at agriculture on the High Plains has been recognized by three prestigious awards.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fj.1936-704X.2017.03256.x",""

Here we use a suite of idealized, high‐resolution numerical ocean simulations to investigate how fjord circulation driven by subglacial plumes, tides, and wind stress depends on fjord width, grounding line depth, and sill height. We find that the depth of the grounding line compared to the sill is a primary control on plume‐driven renewal of basin waters. In wide fjords the plume exhibits strong lateral recirculation, increasing the dilution and residence time of glacially‐modified waters. Rapid drawdown of basin waters by the subglacial plume in narrow fjords allows for shelf waters to cascade deep into the basin; wide fjords result in a thin, boundary current of shelf waters that flow toward the terminus slightly below sill depth. Wind forcing amplifies the plume‐driven exchange flow; however, wind‐induced vertical mixing is limited to near‐surface waters. Tidal mixing over the sill increases in‐fjord transport of deep shelf waters and erodes basin stratification above the sill depth. These results underscore the first‐order importances of fjord‐glacier geometry in controlling circulation in tidewater glacier fjords and, thus, ocean heat transport to the ice.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2F2017JC012962",""

Here we use a suite of idealized, high‐resolution numerical ocean simulations to investigate how fjord circulation driven by subglacial plumes, tides, and wind stress depends on fjord width, grounding line depth, and sill height. We find that the depth of the grounding line compared to the sill is a primary control on plume‐driven renewal of basin waters. In wide fjords the plume exhibits strong lateral recirculation, increasing the dilution and residence time of glacially‐modified waters. Rapid drawdown of basin waters by the subglacial plume in narrow fjords allows for shelf waters to cascade deep into the basin; wide fjords result in a thin, boundary current of shelf waters that flow toward the terminus slightly below sill depth. Wind forcing amplifies the plume‐driven exchange flow; however, wind‐induced vertical mixing is limited to near‐surface waters. Tidal mixing over the sill increases in‐fjord transport of deep shelf waters and erodes basin stratification above the sill depth. These results underscore the first‐order importances of fjord‐glacier geometry in controlling circulation in tidewater glacier fjords and, thus, ocean heat transport to the ice.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2F2017JC012962",""

However, costly truck-driver turnover rates have plagued the industry for years. While previous research has focused on a variety of factors that can contribute to a driver leaving his or her current organization and/or the industry, long-haul turnover rates remain unacceptably high. Using a phenomenological methodology, this research explores psychological aspects of truck drivers' experiences in order to better understand the challenges and stressors that may lead to dissatisfaction with their careers and ultimately their decision to leave their company and/or the industry. Data was collected from drivers through face-to-face interviews and Internet blogs. The findings identify both controllable and uncontrollable psychological stressors that truck drivers experience and how these stressors manifest in their jobs. The themes identified include stress from loneliness and loss of family life, stress due to health-related issues and uncertainty from health-related support, lack of respect from multiple parties, and the stressful impact of government regulations. Identification of these themes may help organizations develop strategies to address these important stressors and improve the retention and performance of their drivers.","https://scholarlypublishingcollective.org/psup/transportation-journal/article-pdf/56/1/54/1347779/transportationj_56_1_54.pdf",""

FDTT inverted the P- and SH-wave picked traveltimes at 250 Hz to provide long-wavelength background velocity models as the starting models for FWI. FWI inverted 18–54 Hz P-wave data and 16–50 Hz SH-wave data to produce velocity models with subwavelength- and wavelength-scale features allowing for direct interpretation of the velocity models as is usually carried out in conventional imaging using seismic reflection data. The P- and SH-wave models image the top part of the tunnel at the correct location at a depth of 1.6 m as a high-velocity anomaly. The P-wave models also image the air in the void space of the tunnel as a low-velocity anomaly. The inverted models were assessed by synthetic tests, the consistency of the inverted sources, and the fit between the predicted and observed data. As a comparison, conventional ray-theory infinite-frequency traveltime tomography (IFTT) was also applied in a combined workflow with FWI. The comparisons of the inverted models favor the use of FDTT over IFTT because (1) The FDTT models better recover the magnitude of the velocity anomalies and (2) the FDTT model serves as a better starting model for FWI, which results in a more accurate FWI velocity estimation with better recovery of the magnitude and location of the key features. FDTT will not provide significant benefits over IFTT in all studies, particularly those in which ray theory is valid.","https://library.seg.org/doi/am-pdf/10.1190/geo2016-0085.1",""

Furthermore, the effect of NiO-film thickness on the resistive switching, as well as the I-V and C-V characteristics, indicates that the unidirectional threshold resistive switching originates from the combined contributions of the interfacial Schottky junction modulation and the bipolar threshold switching related to the unstable conductive filament in NiO film.

Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment method that is administered orally or intravenously at an outpatient oncology clinic. Chemotherapy patients require a treatment regimen, which is a series of appointments over several weeks or months prescribed by the oncologist. The timing of these appointments is critical to the effectiveness of the chemotherapy treatment on cancer. This motivates the need for new methods for making efficient appointment schedules and for assessing clinic operation performance from both patient and management perspectives. This work uses a classic modeling approach based on systems theory to develop a discrete event system specification (DEVS) simulation model for oncology clinic operations called DEVS-CHEMO. DEVS-CHEMO is configurable to any oncology clinic and provides several capabilities for oncology clinic managers. For example, it can simulate scheduling of chemotherapy patients, clinic resources, and the arrival process of the patients to the clinic on the day of their appointment. This model simulates oncology clinic operations as patients receive chemotherapy treatments and thus allows for assessing scheduling algorithms using both patient and management perspectives. DEVS-CHEMO has been tested and validated using historical data from a real outpatient oncology clinic and the simulation results reported in this paper provide several insights regarding oncology clinic operations management.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0037549717708246",""

Just as consumers display differential attachment tendencies for material purchases, so too should they exhibit differences in experiential purchase attachment propensities. This research examines this issue and contributes to the literature on purchase attachment by examining individual differences in material versus experiential attachment tendencies. Specifically, this work shows that loneliness increases attachment to purchases that affirm one's social self and restore a sense of connection to others; however, the type of purchase that best achieves this social affirmation goal varies as a function of the consumer's sex. Females (males) are more likely to think about their material (experiential) purchases as representative of their relationships with others; therefore, lonely females (males) are more likely to attach to material (experiential) purchases. Across 5 studies, we demonstrate this sex by loneliness interaction and investigate the perceived effectiveness of material/experiential purchases as social cues, as a mechanism underlying these effects. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these attachment patterns influence future purchase tendencies—material (experiential) attachment predicts continued spending of disposable income on material (experiential) purchases.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fcb.1686",""

We then report the results of an experiment in which 50 experienced audit managers budget time for an audit program that tests a Level-3 fair-value estimate. Prior research and Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) inspections indicate that this is a challenging audit area, vulnerable to allegations of low audit quality.

Research on salesperson turnover has conceptually studied the consequences of voluntary turnover on a firm. However, little empirical research has investigated the antecedents of salesperson turnover—specifically, the role of own effects (relative performance, customer satisfaction, and goal realization) and peer effects (peer performance variance and turnover). Therefore, the authors propose a framework to assess the influence of own factors (through identity theory) and of peer factors (through social identity theory) on salesperson turnover. Using a proportional hazard model implemented on data consisting of 6,727 salespeople over two years, the results suggest that in addition to own behaviors, managers need to pay attention to peer behaviors because peer turnover (voluntary and involuntary) greatly increases a salesperson's turnover probability. Furthermore, the results indicate that peer effects have a greater impact than own effects. This research has implications for sales force management because it helps managers (1) identify a salesperson's turnover risk, (2) diagnose the drivers of turnover behavior, and (3) build strategies to prevent salesperson turnover.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1509/jmr.15.0485",""

The calibration procedure we use is common to both the RGB and thermal cameras. The extrinsic calibration procedure assumes that the cameras are geometrically calibrated. To aid the geometric calibration of the thermal camera, we use a calibration target made of black-and-white melamine that looks like a checkerboard pattern in the thermal and RGB images. For the extrinsic calibration, we place a circular calibration target in the common field of view of the cameras and the LIDAR and compute the extrinsic parameters by minimizing an objective function that aligns the edges of the circular target in the LIDAR to its corresponding edges in the RGB and thermal images. We illustrate the convexity of the objective function and discuss the convergence of the algorithm. We then identify the various sources of coloring errors (after cross-calibration) as (a) noise in the LIDAR points, (b) error in the intrinsic parameters of the camera, (c) error in the translation parameters between the LIDAR and the camera and (d) error in the rotation parameters between the LIDAR and the camera. We analyze the contribution of these errors with respect to the coloring of a 3D point. We illustrate that these errors are related to the depth of the 3D point considered — with errors (a), (b), and (c) being inversely proportional to the depth, and error (d) being directly proportional to the depth.","https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S2301385017500054",""

The eponymous protagonist seeks his meaning and purpose in a universe that offers none. Jean-Paul Sartre’s existentialism proposes that people must fill the blank slate of the self and establish their own values through their actions. However, instead of establishing his values according to his constantly becoming self, Suttree restrictively bases his values on his material, monetary, functional and social existence. Sartre’s theory of bad faith provides a means to understand Suttree’s identity conflict and argues that the individual should identify not with any particular state of being, but rather with the constant process of becoming. Bad faith is a mode of self-deception in which one believes he is something he is not, or believes he is not something that he is. Suttree’s many forms of bad faith—material, monetary, functional, and social—hinder his ability to live a more meaningful and fulfilling life and embrace his responsibility to create himself. Of all the forms of bad faith Suttree suffers, perhaps the most detrimental to his project of self-creation is his failure to let go of the past. His obsession with past failures and deaths impedes his progress to a new, productive self. By transcending his oppressive past and realizing that he is a combination of his constituent parts and never solely one of them, Suttree understands his responsibility to embrace his past and propel himself into new identities in the constant quest of becoming. Suttree exemplifies a responsible embrace of the project of self-creation in the midst of materialism and nihilism.","https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0787/6/2/38/pdf",""

Complex biological events—including genetics, epigenetics, maternal maturity, maternal nutrition, placenta efficiency, uterine capacity, and other environmental factors—can affect fetal growth and development during late gestation, as well as maturity of oocytes, duration of estrus, and both implantation and placentation of conceptuses in uteri of sows. Understanding the physiological changes related to initiation and progress of IUGR are, therefore, of great importance to formulate nutritional strategies that can mitigate IUGR in gilts and sows. Altering the nutritional status of sows prior to mating and during early‐, mid‐, and late‐gestation may be effective at increasing the uniformity of oocytes and conceptuses, decreasing variation among conceptuses during elongation and implantation, and preventing increases in within‐litter variation in fetal weights during late gestation. This review summarizes current progress on physiological alterations responsible for IUGR fetuses, as well as possible nutritional interventions to prevent the initiation and continuation of IUGR in gilts and sows.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fmrd.22842",""

This is most effective at low temperature and high magnetic field, and with the invention of the dissolution method, the amplified nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals in the frozen state in DNP can be harnessed in the liquid-state at physiologically acceptable temperature for in vitro and in vivo metabolic studies. A current optimization practice in dissolution DNP is to dope the sample with trace amounts of lanthanides such as Gd3+ or Ho3+, which further improves the polarization. While Gd3+ and Ho3+ have been optimized for use in dissolution DNP, other lanthanides have not been exhaustively studied for use in C13 DNP applications. In this work, two additional lanthanides with relatively high magnetic moments, Dy3+ and Tb3+, were extensively optimized and tested as doping additives for C13 DNP at 3.35 T and 1.2 K. We have found that both of these lanthanides are also beneficial additives, to a varying degree, for C13 DNP. The optimal concentrations of Dy3+ (1.5 mM) and Tb3+ (0.25 mM) for C13 DNP were found to be less than that of Gd3+ (2 mM). W-band electron paramagnetic resonance shows that these enhancements due to Dy3+ and Tb3+ doping are accompanied by shortening of electron T1 of trityl OX063 free radical. Furthermore, when dissolution was employed, Tb3+-doped samples were found to have similar liquid-state C13 NMR signal enhancements compared to samples doped with Gd3+, and both Tb3+ and Dy3+ had a negligible liquid-state nuclear T1 shortening effect which contrasts with the significant reduction in T1 when using Gd3+. Our results show that Dy3+ doping and Tb3+ doping have a beneficial impact on C13 DNP both in the solid and liquid states, and that Tb3+ in particular could be used as a potential alternative to Gd3+ in C13 dissolution DNP experiments.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.4973317/14845316/014303_1_online.pdf",""

Methods: Using a national survey, we factor analyze the latent dimensions of various reforms, and rely on an experimental design to explain the role policy narratives, cultural theory (CT), and political knowledge play in preference formation. Results: The reform debate groups along three dimensions: (1) strengthening limitations and regulations, (2) deregulating campaign finance, or (3) ending the dependence on private money altogether. We show policy narratives are most influential, and CT has more explanatory value, among those with higher levels of political knowledge. Certain policy narratives tend to increase support for CFR across all cultural types, including those who most oppose reforms that seek to end the dependence on private money. Conclusion: As awareness of campaign finance increases, and as particular narratives become salient, we would expect increasing support for public financing, free media time, and/or public matching funds among those with higher levels of general political knowledge.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fssqu.12357",""

Groundwater models capable of simulating human‐hydrologic‐climate interactions are crucial to guide future water management and policy planning endeavors in this water stressed region. A well‐defined conceptual model is a necessary first‐step in that direction. Conceptual modeling should not be limited to compiling necessary datasets but must also focus on generating critical insights pertaining to human‐climate‐aquifer interactions especially when the emphasis is on guiding future policy. Model integration and the feasibility of coupling available tools and techniques must be explored to fill‐in critical data gaps and capture interactions with a high degree of fidelity. A conceptual modeling framework built on this premise was applied to guide an on‐going regional‐scale groundwater modeling study in the SHP. The paucity of groundwater production data was identified as a major limiting factor. A linked Decision Support System for Agro‐Technology Transfer (DSSAT) model with MODFLOW is expected to be useful in obtaining groundwater production estimates through detailed crop modeling. The time to recharge is long (decades to centuries) over most of the SHP. As such, the coupling of watershed and groundwater models is perhaps not warranted. Baseflow separation indicated that surface water‐groundwater interactions have diminished over the last six decades due to declining water tables. While groundwater withdrawals generally increased during droughts, the aquifer also buffered climatic influences at some locations.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fj.1936-704X.2017.03261.x",""

For example, many carnivores and primates possess a map for orientation selectivity in primary visual cortex (V1), whereas mice, rabbits, and the gray squirrel lack orientation maps. In this report we show that a carnivorous rodent with predatory behaviors, the grasshopper mouse ( Onychomys arenicola), lacks a canonical columnar organization of orientation preference in V1; however, neighboring neurons within 50 μm exhibit related tuning preference. Using a combination of two-photon microscopy and extracellular electrophysiology, we demonstrate that the functional organization of visual cortical neurons in the grasshopper mouse is largely the same as in the C57/BL6 laboratory mouse.

The mRNA abundance of AMPkɑ, IGF-I, MHC-I, IIA and IIX, β1-adrenergic receptor (βAR) and β2AR was determined, as well as, cross-sectional area and proportion of myosin isoforms, β1AR, β2AR, β3AR, nuclei, and satellite cell density.

The typical signal from such particles spreads among many pixels due to charge sharing effects. As a consequence, the deposited energy in each pixel cannot be reconstructed unless the detector is calibrated, limiting the usability of such signals for calibration. To avoid this shortcoming, we calibrate using low energy X-rays. However, charge sharing effects still occur, resulting in part of the energy being deposited in adjacent pixels and possibly lost. This systematic error in the calibration process results in an error of about 5% in the energy measurements of calibrated devices. We use FLUKA simulations to assess the magnitude of charge sharing effects, allowing a corrected energy calibration to be performed on several Timepix pixel detectors and resulting in substantial improvement in energy deposition measurements. Next, we address shortcomings in calibration associated with the huge range (from kiloelectron-volts to megaelectron-volts) of energy deposited per pixel which result in a nonlinear energy response over the full range. We introduce a new method to characterize the non-linear response of the Timepix detectors at high input energies. We demonstrate improvement using a broad range of particle types and energies, showing that the new method reduces the energy measurement errors, in some cases by more than 90%.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/rsi/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.4978281/16076628/033301_1_online.pdf",""

We find that securitized loans are associated with higher covenant standardization than nonsecuritized institutional loans. In addition, we show that CLOs with more diverse or frequently rebalanced portfolios are more likely to purchase loans with standardized covenants, potentially because standardization alleviates information processing costs related to loan monitoring and screening. We also document that covenant standardization is associated with greater loan and CLO note rating agreement between credit rating agencies, further supporting the relation between lower information costs and covenant standardization. Overall, our study provides evidence that loan securitization is related to the design of standardized financial covenants.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2F1475-679X.12186",""

Stem cell transplantation is used to treat these diseases, but this procedure is limited by the availability of a suitable donor. The intestinal microbiota drives host immune homeostasis by regulating the development of Treg, Th1 and Th2 cells. It is currently unclear if Treg-deficiency autoimmune disorders can be treated by targeting the enteric microbiota. Our aims are to determine the autoimmunity, gut microbiota, and plasma metabolomics affected by probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 (LR), and to further identify the mechanism of modulated metabolite(s) in suppressing autoimmunity in Treg-deficient scurfy (SF) mice. We demonstrated that Foxp3+Treg deficiency results in gut microbial dysbiosis and autoimmunity over the lifespan of SF mouse. Remodeling microbiota with LR prolonged survival and reduced multi-organ inflammation in SF mice. LR changed the metabolomics profile disrupted by Treg-deficiency with a major effect of restoring levels of the purine metabolite inosine. Feeding inosine itself prolonged life and inhibited multi-organ inflammation by reducing Th1/Th2 cells and their associated cytokines. Mechanistically, the inhibition of inosine on the differentiation of Th1 and Th2 cells in vitro depended on adenosine A2A receptors. Both A2A receptor specific antagonist or genetically knockout A2A to SF mice reversed the anti-inflammatory effects of both inosine and LR in vivo. In conclusions, A2A receptors mediate a substantial protective effect of inosine and LR. The LR-modulated-microbiota-inosine-A2A axis might represent a potential avenue for combatting autoimmune diseases mediated by Treg dysfunction.","https://journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article/198/1_Supplement/127.22/58409/Therapeutic-effect-of-Lactobacillus-reuteri-DSM",""

We test this using the case of immigration and welfare generosity following the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996. Using state-level data from 1997 to 2009, we find that under conditions of low immigration, social capital is associated with increased social trust and empathy; however, as immigration increases, social capital pivots toward favoring mechanisms of social control. Specifically, social capital increases Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) cash benefit levels, but only when immigration levels are low.

Theoretically, “stable” elevations should maintain themselves through time if the balance of processes creating that elevation remains unchanged. At Louisiana's prograding Wax Lake Delta, we measure landscape change between 2009 and 2013, quantifying volumetric changes to the delta, subaerial slope adjustment, and an equilibrium elevation of 0.56 m North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (where elevation change, on average, is zero), around which elevations fluctuate. We calculate a system average “equilibrium time scale” of 16 years to describe how long locations will take to approach the stable elevation. This time scale increases as a function of distance from channel edge. Peaks in elevation probability density functions can form for multiple reasons and do not require stability; e.g., peaks can temporarily form at elevations where elevation change rate is locally minimum.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2F2016GL072070",""

Specifically, energy propagation in composites consisting of aluminum mixed with copper oxide (Al + CuO) exhibits a 24% increase in flame speed when using pre-stressed aluminum (PS Al) compared to Al of the same particle size. However, no data exist for the reactivity of PS Al powders under impact loading. In this study, a drop weight impact tester with pressure cell was designed and built to examine impact ignition sensitivity and combustion of PS Al when mixed with CuO. Both micron and nanometer scale powders (i.e., μAl and nAl, respectively) were pre-stressed, then combined with CuO and analyzed. Three types of ignition and combustion events were identified: ignition with complete combustion, ignition with incomplete combustion, and no ignition or combustion. The PS nAl + CuO demonstrated a lower impact ignition energy threshold for complete combustion, differing from nAl + CuO samples by more than 3.5 J/mg. The PS nAl + CuO also demonstrated significantly more complete combustion as evidenced by pressure history data during ignition and combustion. Additional material characterization provides insight on hot spot formation in the incomplete combustion samples. The most probable reasons for higher impact-induced reactivity of pre-stressed particles include (a) delayed but more intense fracture of the pre-stressed alumina shell due to release of energy of internal stresses during fracture and (b) detachment of the shell from the core during impact due to high tensile stresses in the Al core leading to much more pronounced fracture of unsupported shells and easy access of oxygen to the Al core. The μAl + CuO composites did not ignite, even under pre-stressed conditions.","http://aip.scitation.org/doi/am-pdf/10.1063/1.5003632",""

In this work, we report strong evidence for preferential hydrogen adsorption at edge-sites in an edge oriented vertically aligned 3-D network of MoS2 flakes at room temperature. The vertically aligned edge-oriented MoS2 flakes were synthesised by a modified CVD process on a SiO2/Si substrate and confirmed by Scanning Electron Microscopy. Raman spectroscopy and PL spectroscopy reveal the signature of few-layer MoS2 flakes in the sample. The sensor's performance was tested from room temperature to 150 °C for 1% hydrogen concentration. The device shows a fast response of 14.3 s even at room temperature. The sensitivity of the device strongly depends on temperature and increases from ∼1% to ∼11% as temperature increases. A detail hydrogen sensing mechanism was proposed based on the preferential hydrogen adsorption at MoS2 edge sites. The proposed gas sensing mechanism was verified by depositing ∼2–3 nm of ZnO on top of the MoS2 flakes that partially passivated the edge sites. We found a decrease in the relative response of MoS2-ZnO hybrid structures. This study provides a strong experimental evidence for the role of MoS2 edge-sites in the fast hydrogen sensing and a step closer towards room temperature, low power (0.3 mW), hydrogen sensor development.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.5000825/13141714/093102_1_online.pdf",""

As Moore's law slows down, and the number of transistors per die no longer grows at historical rates, the performance curve of single monolithic GPUs will ultimately plateau. However, the need for higher performing GPUs continues to exist in many domains. To address this need, in this paper we demonstrate that package-level integration of multiple GPU modules to build larger logical GPUs can enable continuous performance scaling beyond Moore's law. Specifically, we propose partitioning GPUs into easily manufacturable basic GPU Modules (GPMs), and integrating them on package using high bandwidth and power efficient signaling technologies. We lay out the details and evaluate the feasibility of a basic Multi-Chip-Module GPU (MCM-GPU) design. We then propose three architectural optimizations that significantly improve GPM data locality and minimize the sensitivity on inter-GPM bandwidth. Our evaluation shows that the optimized MCM-GPU achieves 22.8% speedup and 5x inter-GPM bandwidth reduction when compared to the basic MCM-GPU architecture. Most importantly, the optimized MCM-GPU design is 45.5% faster than the largest implementable monolithic GPU, and performs within 10% of a hypothetical (and unbuildable) monolithic GPU. Lastly we show that our optimized MCM-GPU is 26.8% faster than an equally equipped Multi-GPU system with the same total number of SMs and DRAM bandwidth.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3140659.3080231",""

The synergism between malnutrition and infection contributes substantially to childhood morbidity and mortality. Anthropometric indicators of malnutrition are associated with the increased risk and severity of infections caused by many pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and helminths. Since childhood malnutrition commonly involves the inadequate intake of protein and calories, with superimposed micronutrient deficiencies, the causal factors involved in impaired host defense are usually not defined. This review focuses on literature related to impaired host defense and the risk of infection in primary childhood malnutrition. Particular attention is given to longitudinal and prospective cohort human studies and studies of experimental animal models that address causal, mechanistic relationships between malnutrition and host defense. Protein and micronutrient deficiencies impact the hematopoietic and lymphoid organs and compromise both innate and adaptive immune functions. Malnutrition-related changes in intestinal microbiota contribute to growth faltering and dysregulated inflammation and immune function. Although substantial progress has been made in understanding the malnutrition-infection synergism, critical gaps in our understanding remain. We highlight the need for mechanistic studies that can lead to targeted interventions to improve host defense and reduce the morbidity and mortality of infectious diseases in this vulnerable population.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/CMR.00119-16",""

The authors propose that consumer reluctance to part with possessions with sentimental value causes a bottleneck in the donation process. The goal of this research is therefore to provide nonprofits with tools to increase donations of used goods and provide a theoretical link between the literature streams on prosocial behavior, disposition, memory, and identity. As such, the authors explore the effectiveness of memory preservation strategies (e.g., taking a photo of a good before donating it) in increasing donations to nonprofits. A field study using a donation drive demonstrates that encouraging consumers to take photos of sentimental possessions before donating them increases donations, and five laboratory experiments explicate this result by mapping the proposed psychological process behind the success of memory preservation techniques. Specifically, these techniques operate by ameliorating consumers’ perceived identity loss when considering donation of sentimental goods.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1509/jm.16.0311",""

Counter-traditions of general and holistic knowledge persisted, but specialization in segmented discipline-based domains increasingly shaped the contours of humanities education and research—to the detriment of older, transdisciplinary elements. Over the course of the twentieth century, a number of developments fostered interactions across the disciplines, extending from the importation of European philosophy and literary studies to postcolonial critique.

Purpose/Hypothesis: We drew on results from the Graduate Student Experiences and Motivations Survey to explore the dimensionality of our scales measuring value and cost constructs. We used these scales, as well as measures of student expectancy of success, to compare returners with direct‐pathway students. Design/Method: We surveyed 179 returners and 297 direct‐pathway domestic engineering doctoral students. We first conducted Exploratory Factor Analysis on our cost and value measures. We then used both Ordinary Least Squares and Ordinal Regression Model analyses to assess the relationships of various student characteristics and experiences (including returner status) with student expectancy of success and the emergent cost and values factors associated with doctoral study in engineering. Results: Factor analysis revealed three categories of values (interest, attainment, and career utility) that were largely consistent with those in Eccles’ expectancy‐value framework. A similar analysis identified three categories of costs (balance, financial, and academic) associated with pursuing a PhD. Returners felt significantly less confident in their ability to complete their degrees prior to enrolling and perceived higher levels of all cost types than direct‐pathway students.

Data were collected from front page newspaper articles and analysis was developed using the techniques of critical discourse analysis. Drawing on Foucault’s (1977) theoretical understanding of the enmeshment of power relations in discourse as well as Blumer’s (1958) group position model, we develop and test five hypotheses about the role of news elites in constructing this social group. Finding support for all hypotheses, we show how the article’s discursive choices dehumanized immigrants, trivialized their experiences, silenced their voices and helped legitimate an unequal social hierarchy that positions immigrants beneath non-immigrants.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0957926517710990",""

Background: The original tool had acceptable sensitivity and specificity for identifying potentially aggressive patients in acute care medical‐surgical units, but its usefulness in long‐term care homes is unknown. Design: A retrospective cohort study design was used. Methods: All residents admitted to 25 long‐term care homes in western Canada were assessed for the risk of aggression using the original tool within 24 hours of admission from January 2014 ‐ December 2014 ( Results: Fifty‐three residents of 724 exhibited aggressive behaviours.

Recent data indicate that false safety behaviors (FSB; ie, behaviors that may be effective in decreasing anxiety in the short‐term, but can maintain and even exacerbate anxiety in the long‐term) are related to cannabis problem severity. Thus, an important next step is to identify factors implicated in the relation between FSB and cannabis use behavior. The current study tested whether FSB were uniquely related to cannabis use problems and high‐risk cannabis use motives. We also tested whether FSB were indirectly related to cannabis outcomes via high‐risk motives. Method: The sample consisted of 349 current (69.6% female) cannabis‐using undergraduates who completed an online survey. Results: FSB was robustly related to cannabis‐related problems and cannabis use motives (ie, coping and availability) after controlling for anxiety and cannabis use frequency. FSB was indirectly related to cannabis problems via coping and availability motives and to cannabis use frequency via coping motives. Discussion and Conclusions: Results add to a growing literature indicating that FSB are related to cannabis problem severity and extend this work by identifying mechanisms underlying this relationship.

It is particularly suitable for discrete categorical data where principal component analysis is generally not applicable. Furthermore, this technique utilizes three different programs in conjunction with a design repository, which is opposed to traditional methods that require experts to empirically derive graph grammars. This technique can be separated into three steps. These steps are the creation of the input, graph data mining, and interpretation of the output with the intention of these steps being to automate or assist an expert with the process of extracting engineering graph grammars. Graph grammars that can then serve as guidelines during concept generation. The results of this paper show that this technique is very applicable to computational design synthesis by testing only a small number of products and still producing tangible results that coincide with empirically derived graphs. Fifty electromechanical products from the design repository are used in this study. When comparing, the machine generated grammar rules with expert derived grammar rules, it can be seen that only 14% cannot be developed, 58% cannot be mined with the current setup and 28% were mined with the current set up. However, it is important to keep in mind a few considerations. Specifically, the technique does not replace the expert. Instead, the technique acts as more of an aid than a replacement. Also, while this technique has great potential in regards to computational design synthesis, it is limited to the products in the design repository and the current implementation of the aforementioned programs. Despite these minor considerations, this work proposes application of graph data mining to derive engineering grammars.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/DETC2017-67520/2472933/v02at03a006-detc2017-67520.pdf",""

In addition, recent empirical work has focused on how OCB is an intraindividual phenomenon, such that employees vary daily in the extent to which they help others. However, one limitation of this research has been an overemphasis on well‐being consequences associated with daily helping (e.g., changes in affect and mental depletion) and far less attention on behavioral outcomes. In this study, we develop a self‐regulatory framework that articulates how helping others at work is a depleting experience that can lead to a reduction in subsequent acts of helping others, and an increase in behaviors aimed at helping oneself (i.e., engaging in political acts). We further theorize how two individual differences—prevention focus and political skill—serve as cross‐level moderators of these relations. In an experience sampling study of 91 full‐time employees across 10 consecutive workdays, our results illustrate that helping is a depleting act that makes individuals more likely to engage in self‐serving acts and less likely to help others. Moreover, the relation of helping acts with depletion is strengthened for employees who have higher levels of prevention focus.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fpeps.12229",""

In this commentary, we explore the various processes that might enhance mixing in the hyporheic zone relative to deeper groundwater, and pose the question whether the substantial mixing suggested by field studies may be due to the combination of fluctuating boundary conditions and multiscale physical and chemical spatial heterogeneity. We encourage investigation of hyporheic mixing using numerical modeling and laboratory experiments to ultimately inform field investigations.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2F2016WR020005",""

With current standard treatment options, the overall 5 year survival rate is about 16% and these treatment plans often cause high toxicity. Therefore, there is an urgent need for identifying more effective and less toxic agents for the treatment of this malignancy. Tolfenamic acid (TA) is a generic drug used to treat migraine headaches but has been demonstrated to have anti-cancer activity in pre-clinical studies. It is known to downregulate the transcription factor Specificity protein 1 (Sp1). Sp1 regulates several genes involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis, including survivin, an inhibitor of apoptosis protein. Interestingly, a recent discovery proposed that copper(II) complex of TA can result in higher therapeutic response; however its efficacy was not tested in gastro-intestinal cancers. In this study, we assessed the therapeutic efficacy of a Cu(II)- containing complex of TA (Cu-TA) using human pancreatic cancer cell lines. MIA PaCa-2 and Panc-1 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of vehicle (DMSO), equimolar CuCl2 (negative control), TA or Cu-TA and the cell viability was measured at 24 and 48 h post-treatment using CellTiter-Glo kit. CuTA was further tested for its effect on Sp1 and survivin expression in MIA PACa-2 cells by Western blot (protein) and quantitative PCR (mRNA). The activation of apoptosis was determined by measuring the activity of effector caspases using the Caspase3/7-Glo kit and the apoptotic cell population through flow cytometric analysis using Annexin-V staining. Cell cycle arrest was assessed by flow cytometry with propidium iodide staining. While both TA and Cu-TA caused dose/time-dependent response to inhibit pancreatic cancer cell growth, Cu-TA showed higher efficacy when compared to TA. Cu-TA was highly effective in inhibiting Sp1 and survivin protein expression and showed similar trend for inducing apoptotic markers and causing cell cycle arrest in early phase (G0/G1). The results of qPCR demonstrated that the expression of survivin mRNA was significantly lower following both Cu-TA and TA treatment; however, the mRNA expression of Sp1 remained unchanged. This indicates that TA and Cu-TA could be working in similar mechanism by effecting Sp1 post-translationally, perhaps through proteasome-dependent degradation. These results demonstrate that Cu-TA is more effective than TA and potentially useful for pancreatic cancer treatment after clinical testing. Studies to precisely understand the underlying mechanisms of Cu-TA are currently under investigation through molecular profiling analysis.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/77/13_Supplement/10/616342/Abstract-10-A-small-molecule-derivative",""

Unfortunately, evidence from state and national tests shows that children fail to successfully navigate the reading comprehension challenges they face. Schools have struggled to find approaches that can help children succeed in this important task. Typical instruction in classrooms across the country has focused on procedural application of strategies or content-focused approaches that encourage rich discussions. Both approaches have achieved success but have limitations-related transparency and specificity of scaffolds and guidance for the teacher and learner in today’s diverse and complex classroom settings. The text structure strategy combines content and strategy to provide pragmatic, transparent, and scaffolded instruction addressing these challenges. A web-based intelligent tutoring system for the text structure strategy, named ITSS, was designed and developed to provide consistent and high-quality instruction to learners in Grades 4 and 5 about how to read, select main ideas, encode strategic memory structures, make inferences, and monitor comprehension during reading. In this article, we synthesize results from two recent large-scale randomized controlled studies to showcase how the ITSS supports selection and encoding of students’ strategic memory structures and how prior knowledge affects the memory structures. We provide greater depth of information about such processing than examined and reported in extant literature about overall increases in reading comprehension resulting from students using ITSS.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0735633117696909",""

Based on microlevel locational attainment analyses, we find that for Latinos, acculturation and socioeconomic status are positively associated with greater residential contact with Whites and thus promote lower segregation consistent with predictions of spatial assimilation theory. However, standardization and decomposition analysis reveals that a substantial portion of White-Latino segregation can be attributed to White-Latino differences in the ability to translate acculturation and socioeconomic assimilation into co-residence with Whites. Thus, consistent with predictions of place stratification theory, evidence suggests that spatial assimilation dynamics are limited by continuing race-based factors leading to the expectation that segregation will persist at moderate to high levels even after Latinos reach parity with Whites on social and economic resources that shape locational attainments. Therefore, we offer two conclusions. First, contemporary White-Latino segregation is due in part to group differences in social and economic resources that determine locational attainments and that this component of White-Latino segregation will continue to be significant so long as Whites and Latinos differ along these social and economic characteristics. Second, while spatial assimilation dynamics can promote partial reductions in White-Latino segregation, we expect segregation to continue at moderate to high levels because place stratification dynamics limit Latino residential integration even when Latinos and Whites are comparable on relevant resources.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2332649217748426",""

Soil treatment with a liquid termiticide is a widely used method for controlling subterranean termites in structures. We assessed the efficacy of a nonrepellent termiticide, Altriset® (active ingredient: chlorantraniliprole), in controlling structural infestations of R. flavipes in Texas, North Carolina, and Ohio and determined the post-treatment fate of termite colonies in and around the structures. In all three states, microsatellite markers indicated that only one R. flavipes colony was infesting each structure. A single chlorantraniliprole treatment provided effective structural protection as there was no further evidence of termite activity in and on the majority of structures from approximately 1 month to 2 years post-treatment when the study concluded. Additionally, the treatment appeared to either severely reduce the infesting colony’s footprint at monitors in the landscape or eliminate colony members from these monitors. A supplemental spot-treatment was conducted at one house each in Texas and North Carolina at 5 and 6 months post-treatment, respectively; no termites were observed thereafter in these structures and associated landscaping. The number of colonies found exclusively in the landscape (not attacking the structure) varied among the states, with the largest number of colonies in Texas (0–4) and North Carolina (0–5) as compared to 0–1 in Ohio, the most northern state.","https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/8/3/92/pdf",""

Consistent with the reciprocal model of pain and smoking, PLWHA with pain who smoke may use smoking as a means of coping with pain, thus presenting a potential barrier to quitting. The aim of this study is to better understand how pain relates to smoking cessation among 474 HIV-positive adults enrolled in a cell phone–delivered smoking cessation trial. Methods: Participants were randomly assigned to usual care (cessation advice and self-help materials) or 11 sessions of cell phone–delivered smoking cessation treatment. Pain, as assessed by the Medical Outcomes Study-HIV Health Survey (MOS-HIV), and point prevalence abstinence were collected at the 3-month treatment end and at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Self-reported abstinence was biochemically verified by expired carbon monoxide (CO) level of <7 ppm. Results: Using multilevel modeling for binary outcome data, the authors examined the relationship between pain and abstinence, from treatment end through the 12-month follow-up. Consistent with the authors’ hypothesis, less pain was associated with greater likelihood of 24-hour (β = .01, t(651) = 2.53, P = .01) and 7-day (β = .01, t(651) = 2.35, P = .02) point prevalence abstinence, controlling for age, gender, baseline pain, nicotine dependence, and treatment group. No pain × treatment group interaction was observed. Conclusions: These results can help us to better identify PLWHA at greater risk for relapse in smoking cessation treatment. Future research may examine the effectiveness of more comprehensive smoking cessation treatment that incorporates aspects of pain management for PLWHA who smoke and have high pain and symptom burden.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/08897077.2017.1291466",""

Employing a community-based collaborative approach, we constructed a community-informed socioecological conceptual model from a feminist perspective, detailing how armed conflict relates to GBV in a conflict-affected rural community in Northeastern Uganda. The research questions were as follows: (1) How does the community conceptualize GBV? and (2) How does armed conflict relate to GBV? Nine focus group discussions divided by gender, age, and profession and six key informant interviews were conducted. Participants’ ages ranged from 9 to 80 years ( n = 34 girls/women, n = 43 boys/men). Grounded theory was used in analysis. Participants conceptualized eight forms of and 22 interactive variables that contributed to GBV. Armed conflict affected physical violence/quarreling, sexual violence, early marriage, and land grabbing via a direct pathway and four indirect pathways initiated through looting of resources, militarization of the community, death of a parent(s) or husband, and sexual violence. The findings suggest that community, organizational, and policy-level interventions, which include attention to intersecting vulnerabilities for exposure to GBV in conflict-affected settings, should be prioritized. While tertiary psychological interventions with women and girls affected by GBV in these areas should not be eliminated, we suggest that policy makers and members of community and organizational efforts make systemic and structural changes.

However, many of these appeals lead to detrimental effects on the self‐perceptions of the females who view them. This paper integrates components of goal‐striving theory and social comparison theory to explain consumer response to these advertisements and investigates how goal attainability may mitigate the negative effects of these ads. Additionally, this work investigates how a promotion‐focus goal orientation moderates the effects of the goal‐striving process and provides evidence of the mediating effects of shame. Finally, this work addresses a gap in the literature by examining how the interplay of model size and goal attainability impacts male consumers’ self‐perceptions. Study 1 reveals that high levels of perceived goal attainability mitigate the negative effects of exposure to thin models on self‐perceptions for females. Study 2 demonstrates that a high promotion‐focus goal orientation can lead to more favorable self‐perceptions for female participants exposed to a thin model with attainable goals, but it does not isolate participants from feelings of shame, which mediates the effects of goal attainability on self‐perceptions. Study 3 reveals similar findings for male consumers, but notably finds that shame does not play a significant role in understanding the comparison process for male consumers, suggesting key differences in the comparison processes between sexes.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fmar.21004",""

Recent reports postulated that distinct gut microbiota alterations were observed in obese/diabetic subjects. Modulating gut microbiota through bioactive compounds could be a potential therapeutic option. Our previous study has demonstrated that tocotrienols (TT) exert beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis. Therefore, the goal of this study was to further characterize TT‐driven shifts in the cecal microbiome in obese mice with insulin resistance. Twenty male C57BL/6J mice (6‐week‐old) were divided into 2 groups: high‐fat diet (HFD, 60% energy from fat) and HFD+800 mg TT/kg diet (TT800) for 14 weeks. TT is a mixture of 90% delta‐TT and 10% gamma‐TT. To determine the effects of TT on glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance, glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance tests were performed. For microbiome determination, cecal content was collected, DNA was extracted, and 16S rRNA gene metagenome was sequenced. Compared to the HFD group, TT supplementation improved glucose homeostasis as measured by both glucose tolerance test (369.3±22.6 and 243.6±38.9 mg/dL for HFD and TT800, respectively) and insulin tolerance test (relative to time zero: 53.1% and 44.4% for HFD and TT800, respectively). Relative to the HFD diet, dietary TT supplementation increased the Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio in mouse cecum. The number of bacteria which belong to Clostridiales order, especially the Oscillospira genus (Firmicutes phylum) was decreased by 2 fold, whereas the number of S24–7 family members (Bacteroidetes phylum) was significantly increased. Representation of the Akkermansia genus (mucolytic bacteria of Verrucomicrobia phylum) was also increased significantly in the cecal feces of animals supplemented with TT. This study demonstrates that the beneficial effect of TT on glucose homeostasis may be mediated in part through increasing the abundance of beneficial gut microbiome in obese male mice with insulin resistance.","",""

Despite links between excess caloric consumption and adiposity, data are limited on whether fecal pH correlates with changes in body fat during periods of excess fat and sugar consumption and how exercise influences these relationships. Purpose: The goal of this study was to assess whether changes in fecal pH (a proxy for SCFA production) correlated with changes in measures of adiposity during a fat‐sugar supplemented diet and exercise intervention. Methods: Twelve otherwise healthy overweight/obese males (aged 18–50 years; BMI = 29.6±3.6 kg/m Results: Mean fecal pH at baseline was 6.52±0.33. Median (IQR) changes in pH for control, HIIT and MICT groups (0.22 (−0.33, 0.39), 0.22 (−0.80, 0.55), −0.33 (−0.70, −0.08), respectively) did not differ significantly (p=0.375). Although mean % fat did not change significantly in any group, the change in fecal pH across all groups during the intervention was positively correlated with the change in % fat (r=0.69, p=0.013). No correlation was observed between changes in fecal pH and BMI (r=−0.44, p=0.155). Conclusions: Findings from this study suggest that an increase in fecal pH was associated with an increase in percent body fat. These positive changes in adiposity during a period of increased fat and sugar intake suggest that further work is needed to understand the role of gut microbes and SCFA concentrations on body composition over time. Further, these findings suggest a need to understand how different exercise modalities mediate associations between gut SCFA production and changes in body fat. Finally, fecal pH as a proxy for SCFA production in the colon may be a risk marker for weight change during periods of fat‐sugar overfeeding.","",""

In this study, a multivariate approach, asynchronous canonical correlation analysis (ACCA), is proposed and applied to global climate model (GCM) historic simulations and hindcasts from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) to downscale monthly precipitation and temperature over the conterminous United States. ACCA is first applied to the CNRM-CM5 GCM historical simulations for the period 1950–99 and compared with the bias-corrected dataset based on quantile mapping from the Bureau of Reclamation. ACCA is also applied to CNRM-CM5 hindcasts and compared with univariate asynchronous regression (ASR), which applies regular regression to sorted GCM and observed variables. ACCA performs better than ASR and quantile mapping in preserving the cross correlation at grid points where the observed cross correlations are significant while reducing fractional biases in mean and standard deviation. Results also show that preservation of cross correlation increases the bias in standard deviation slightly, but estimates observed precipitation and temperature with increased likelihood, particularly for months exhibiting significant cross correlation. ACCA also better estimates the joint likelihood of observed precipitation and temperature under hindcasts since hindcasts estimate the observed variability in precipitation better. Implications of preserving cross correlations across climate variables for projecting runoff and other land surface fluxes are also discussed.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jhm/article-pdf/18/8/2187/4149988/jhm-d-16-0160_1.pdf",""

For serum metabolites, the HFD+TT group had higher levels of some essential amino acids, B vitamins, and 12 HEPE in serum compared to the HFD group. In addition, the HFD+TT group had reduced thromboxane B2 and 13 HODE, and increased 12HEPE, lysine, and methionine. These results suggest TT supplementation lowered inflammation and improved macronutrient metabolism in obese mice that may explain reduced obesity.

Since that report, MCR-1 has been described to occur in many Gram-negative pathogens, and the mechanism of MCR-1-mediated resistance was rapidly determined: an ethanolamine is attached to lipid A phosphate groups, rendering the membrane more electropositive and repelling positively charged polymyxins. Acquisition of MCR-1 is clinically significant because polymyxins are frequently last-line antibiotics used to treat extensively resistant organisms, so acquisition of this mechanism might lead to pan-resistant strains. Therefore, the ability to inhibit MCR-1 and restore polymyxin sensitivity would be an important scientific advancement.

Three versions of the stimuli were presented in a between-subjects design: unaltered, monotonized (f0 flattened to remove intonation cues), or low-pass filtered (to remove segmental cues). Preliminary analyses indicate that performance in the unaltered and monotone conditions was more accurate overall than in the low-pass filtered condition, suggesting that listeners rely on segmental information more than prosodic information for classification.

Telogen is further divided into refractory and competent telogen based on bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) expression. BMP4 inhibits anagen induction by directly inhibiting wingless‐related MMTV integration site 7A (WNT7A) and other WNTs. Transient activation of WNT signaling in hair follicle stem cells triggers anagen induction; while sustained WNT signaling activation in hair follicle stem cells leads to skin cancer. Previously, we localized a complete set of proteins involved in retinoic acid (RA) synthesis and signaling to the hair follicle, whose expression changed throughout the hair cycle. We also found that dietary vitamin A altered the hair cycle in a dose dependent manner. The purpose of this study was to further define these hair cycle changes. We initially examined localization of RA synthesis proteins retinal dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH1A2), cellular RA binding protein 2 (CRABP2), RA degradation enzyme cytochrome p450 26B1 (CYP26B1), and BMP4 in telogen hair follicles in 70–100 day old female C57BL/6J mice by immunohistochemistry. All proteins localized to BMP4 positive telogen hair follicles. ALDH1A2 was also seen in BMP4 negative telogen hair follicles, but at a lower level. However, CRABP2 and CYP26B1 were barely detectable in BMP4 negative follicles. This suggests that RA synthesis and signaling may be stronger in refractory telogen compared to competent telogen. We next examined the expression of BMP4 and WNT7A by immunohistochemistry in telogen hair follicles from mice fed various levels of vitamin A from our previous studies. In one study female C57BL/6J mice bred an unpurified diet containing 6–28 IU vitamin A/g diet were switched to purified AIN93M diets containing 4, 28, or 56 IU vitamin A/g diet at 12 weeks of age and fed these diets for 16 weeks (High RA bred). In another study, female C57BL/6J mice were bred for two generations on the AIN93 growth diet containing 4 IU vitamin A/g diet then at 6 weeks of age fed AIN93M diets containing 4, 28, or 56 IU vitamin A/g diet for 12 weeks (Adequate RA bred). Breeding mice on the AIN93 diet was previously shown to reduce RA levels in several tissues. In High RA bred mice, consuming excess (56 IU) vitamin A increased BMP4 and reduced WNT7A. However in Adequate RA bred mice the reverse was seen; excess vitamin A (56 IU) reduced BMP4 and increased WNT7A. One side effect of pharmacological doses of oral synthetic retinoids is telogen effluvium – i.e. loss of hair while follicles are trapped in telogen. Our results in High RA bred mice suggest that excess vitamin A arrests hair follicles in refractory telogen, similar to the effects of oral retinoids in humans. However the opposite effects seen in Adequate RA bred mice suggest that physiological levels of dietary vitamin A promote competent telogen, which allows hair follicle stem cells to be activated. Further studies are needed to better define these dose dependent effects. Although, this dose dependent regulation may help explain variable results of retinoids in skin cancer prevention and treatment in mice and humans. This study also highlights the need to breed mice on lower levels of dietary vitamin A to see true physiological effects.","",""

Results from a study of the nonfamily employees of a family-owned service company show that centrality in both family and nonfamily friendship networks reduces turnover, but that friendships with family members have a stronger effect.

Thus, a chemosensing protocol has been designed for these agents that pairs the nucleophilic reactivity of oximates for generating fluoride with an autoinductive target amplification reaction to amplify the quantity of fluoride for facile colorimetric and fluorescent optical quantification. The chemosensing protocol was demonstrated by using the nerve agent surrogate diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) and benzaldoxime as the nucleophile. Autoinductive fluoride amplification responds to fluoride released from DFP by amplifying the fluoride concentration and a yellow reporter molecule. The reporter is a conjugated oligomer with a nominal repeating unit that originates from 4‐aminobenzaldehyde. Exposure of the amplified fluoride to a fluoride‐specific ratiometric fluorescent reporter provides a fluorescent readout, in which three fluorophores are generated per fluoride. Both colorimetric and fluorescent readouts enable quantitative assays with low micromolar limits of detection for fluoride resulting from DFP. More importantly, this work demonstrates the successful merging of multiple complex reactions for achieving selective, sensitive, and quantitative chemosensing.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fchem.201604474",""

In RUM, a rotating cutting tool with metal-bonded diamond abrasive particles is ultrasonically vibrated in the axial direction while the tool spindle is fed toward the workpiece at a constant feedrate to remove material. It has been reported that continuous rotary ultrasonic machining has been successfully used to drill holes in K9 glass. Intermittent rotary ultrasonic machining is a newly introduced ultrasonic machining process, which uses a slotted cutting tool instead of a common metal bonded diamond cutting tool as used in continuous rotary ultrasonic machining. There has been no reported study to compare the effects of intermittent RUM and continuous RUM when machining K9 glass.

This concern is based on a conception of method variance as being produced by the nature of the method itself, and therefore, variables assessed with the same method would share common-method variance that inflates observed correlations. In this paper, we argue for a more complex view of method variance that consists of multiple sources that affect each measured variable in a potentially unique way. Shared sources among measures (common-method variance) act to inflate correlations, whereas unshared sources (uncommon-method variance) act to attenuate correlations. Two empirical examples, one from a simulation study and the other from a single-source survey, are presented to illustrate the complex action of multiple sources of method variance. A five-step approach is suggested whereby a theory of the measure is generated for each measured variable that would inform strategies to control for method variance by assessing and modeling the actions of identified method variance sources.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0149206316687295",""

In addition, prior research indicates that investors view the adoption of such policies positively. We examine the firm‐performance mechanisms underlying favorable stock‐market reactions based on an integration of perspectives from corporate social responsibility and the business case for diversity. Specifically, we estimate a hierarchical linear model (HLM) to account for the nested nature of our data (firms nested within states) and find that (1) the presence of LGBT‐supportive policies is associated with higher firm value, productivity, and profitability; (2) the firm‐value and profitability benefits associated with LGBT‐supportive policies are larger for companies engaged in research and development (R&D) activities; and (3) the firm‐value and profitability benefits of LGBT‐supportive policies persist in the presence of state antidiscrimination laws. In supplemental analyses, we find that firms implementing (discontinuing) LGBT‐supportive policies experience increases (decreases) in firm value, productivity, and profitability. We are among the first to link LGBT‐supportive policies specifically to financial performance outcomes as well as to develop and test a multilevel model of these relationships.

Whereas biometric analyses for the full sample indicated significant heritability for the boldness dimension of psychopathy only, heritability estimates varied by early rearing, with all three triarchic dimensions showing significant heritabilities among mother-reared but not nursery-reared apes. For mother-reared apes, both genes and environment contributed to covariance between meanness and disinhibition, whereas environment contributed mainly to covariation between these dimensions and boldness. Results indicate contributions of both genes and environment to psychopathic tendencies, with an important role for early rearing in their relative contributions to distinct phenotypic subdimensions.

To assess this, an ensemble of 30 supercell simulations was constructed based on small variations to the nontornadic and tornadic environmental profiles composited from the second Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment (VORTEX2). All simulations produce distinct supercells despite occurring in similar environments. Both the tornadic and nontornadic ensemble members possess ample subtornadic surface vertical vorticity; the determinative factor is whether this vorticity can be converged and stretched by the low-level updraft. Each of the 15 members in the tornadic VORTEX2 ensemble produces a long-track, intense tornado. Although there are notable differences in the precipitation and near-surface buoyancy fields, each storm features strong dynamic lifting of surface air with vertical vorticity. This lifting is due to a steady low-level mesocyclone, which is linked to the ingestion of predominately streamwise environmental vorticity. In contrast, each nontornadic VORTEX2 simulation features a supercell with a disorganized low-level mesocyclone, due to crosswise vorticity in the lowest few hundred meters in the nontornadic environment. This generally leads to insufficient dynamic lifting and stretching to accomplish tornadogenesis. Even so, 40% of the nontornadic VORTEX2 ensemble members become weakly tornadic. This implies that chaotic within-storm details can still play a role and, occasionally, lead to marginally tornadic vortices in suboptimal storms.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/MWR-D-17-0152.1",""

However, the reactions involved in a polymer nanocomposite can vary significantly from system to system, making it necessary to investigate novel nanofillers in search for more effective materials. Nanocomposites comprised of alpha-zirconium phosphate (ZrP) nanosheets in poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) were prepared with a wide range of nanoparticle loadings (0, 5, 10, and 30 wt.% ZrP in PMMA). The ZrP nanocomposites were characterized using UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), x-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Nanocomposites were well dispersed and optically transparent as shown by XRD and UV-vis. However in the UV region, transparent ZrP nanocomposites possessed excellent UV scattering properties, significantly reducing the transmittance of UV-light, while remaining transparent to the visual spectrum. Thermal stability studies using TGA and DTG showed the peak mass loss rate (PMLR) was reduced by 10% and simultaneously shifted to higher temperatures by 41 °C. Since the nanocomposites in this work cover such a large range of ZrP loadings, large amounts of high-temperature residuals were encountered after TGA studies, indicating that the high loading ZrP nanocomposites are largely noncombustible. In addition, DSC studies showed that ZrP content does affect the glass transition temperature, but not enough to limit the application in which ZrP nanocomposites could be used. These results point to ZrP nanocomposites being useful as polymer replacements, behaving like polymers until the event of a fire, in which case they are largely noncombustible.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/096739111702500403",""

Using structure-from-motion (SfM) and novel geospatial computing algorithms, this study investigated the potential of high resolution imaging with unmanned aircraft system (UAS) technology for detecting and assessing lodging severity over an experimental maize field at the Texas A&M AgriLife Research and Extension Center in Corpus Christi, Texas, during the 2016 growing season. The method was proposed to not only detect the occurrence of lodging at the field scale, but also to quantitatively estimate the number of lodged plants and the lodging rate within individual rows. Nadir-view images of the field trial were taken by multiple UAS platforms equipped with consumer grade red, green, and blue (RGB), and near-infrared (NIR) cameras on a routine basis, enabling a timely observation of the plant growth until harvesting. Models of canopy structure were reconstructed via an SfM photogrammetric workflow. The UAS-estimated maize height was characterized by polygons developed and expanded from individual row centerlines, and produced reliable accuracy when compared against field measures of height obtained from multiple dates. The proposed method then segmented the individual maize rows into multiple grid cells and determined the lodging severity based on the height percentiles against preset thresholds within individual grid cells. From the analysis derived from this method, the UAS-based lodging results were generally comparable in accuracy to those measured by a human data collector on the ground, measuring the number of lodging plants (R2 = 0.48) and the lodging rate (R2 = 0.50) on a per-row basis. The results also displayed a negative relationship of ground-measured yield with UAS-estimated and ground-measured lodging rate.","https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/9/9/923/pdf",""

Here, the authors report a successful replication of rose hierarchical surface structures by simple and cost-effective processes. A variety of rose structured surfaces were investigated, which confirmed the diversity of functional surface architecture. The polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) negative replica was formed by casting PDMS solution on top of a rose petal followed by a temperature-assisted curing process. The hierarchical structure was further transferred into photoresist films by ultraviolet nanoimprint using the PDMS replica as molds. The imprinted photoresist films demonstrated uniform replications of rose microconvex cells with nanofolding details in the scale of a square centimeter. Super-hydrophobicity was demonstrated on both PDMS negative replica and photoresist positive replica. The incorporation of photoresist replica on the surface of photodetectors improved the responsivity by 35% to 42% due to enhanced light management effect. This bio-inspired transfer imprint process with PDMS provided a high-fidelity and cost-effective method to reproduce functional structures from biological surfaces.

No cats experienced documented systolic systemic hypotension (&lt;90 mmHg). Serum creatinine, and potassium when available, were recorded at baseline and in time windows after initiation of treatment: 1–30 days and 31–60 days. Blood chemistry results were screened for hyperkalemia (≥6.0 mEq/L). During the first 2 mo after starting benazepril therapy, there was a low incidence (3.7%) and clinically insignificant magnitude of hyperkalemia.

A small body of research has examined individuals’ opinions about what behaviors are considered domestic violence. Using a sample of college students, the present study examined a modified version of a somewhat popular instrument used to measure beliefs about domestic violence, extending previous work done by Carlson and Worden. Results indicated beliefs about domestic violence are multidimensional, depending on the nature of the behavior and, in part, the gender of the perpetrator. Opinions about the lawfulness of these behaviors fit the same factor structure as beliefs about domestic violence. Demographic characteristics, current relationship status, secondhand experiences with domestic violence, and perceived prevalence of domestic violence in the community are generally not related to beliefs about domestic violence or the lawfulness of these behaviors. However, attributions of blame on the victim are negatively related to domestic violence beliefs and lawfulness. Moreover, lawfulness is a key covariate for domestic violence beliefs. In addition, results also indicate that the gender of the perpetrator is an important variable affecting student’s beliefs about sexual assault behaviors. Results from this study support the prevailing ideas behind the Battered Women’s Movement that enacting policies and educational programs deeming domestic violence socially, morally, and legally wrong could shift long-standing sociocultural beliefs about men’s use of violence against women.

The objective of the current study was to investigate the potential of circulating cell‐free miRNAs as biomarkers for colorectal cancer (CRC) and its precursor lesion, colorectal adenoma. METHODS: The serum levels of 800 miRNAs were assessed in a discovery set of 21 patients with CRC, 19 patients with adenoma, and 21 healthy controls using the NanoString miRNA analysis platform. Significantly differentially expressed miRNAs were examined further in a validation cohort of 34 patients with CRC, 33 patients with adenoma, and 35 healthy controls using Fluidigm quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays. RESULTS: The ratios between the expression values of the differentially expressed miRNAs were computed. Three miRNA ratios (miR‐17‐5p/miR‐135b, miR‐92a‐3p/miR135b, and miR‐451a/miR‐491‐5p) were validated for discriminating patients with adenoma and those with CRC from the healthy control group, and 5 miRNA ratios (let‐7b/miR‐367‐3p, miR‐130a‐3p/miR‐409‐3p, miR‐148‐3p/miR‐27b, miR‐148a‐3p/miR‐409‐3p, and miR‐21‐5p/miR‐367‐3p) were validated for discriminating patients with CRC from those with adenoma and healthy controls. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values for the 3 miRNA ratios in discriminating patients with adenoma from healthy controls were 0.831 and 0.735, respectively, in the discovery and validation sets. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values for the 5 miRNA ratios in discriminating patients with CRC from those with adenoma were 0.797 and 0.732, respectively, in the discovery and validation sets. Pathway analysis revealed that target genes regulated by the miRNAs from the miRNA ratios were enriched mainly in metabolism‐related and inflammation‐related pathways. CONCLUSIONS: The data from the current study suggest that circulating miRNAs can distinguish patients with CRC and those with adenoma and may represent novel biomarkers for the early, noninvasive detection of CRC.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fcncr.31062",""

Functional analysis of RVLM microarray data via gene ontology profiling and pathway analysis identified upregulation of genes associated with immune- and stress-related responses and downregulation of genes associated with lipid biosynthesis and neurotransmission in aged compared with middle-aged and young rats.

In this study, we investigate how component level interdependence impacts quality performance and analyze how various operational factors moderate this relation. We synthesize information from several case studies to model the quality challenges faced by an automotive firm. For several sub‐assemblies that go into its products, the firm sourced key components from two different suppliers. The sub‐assemblies would fail whenever a component fails, but due to interdependent operations, failure of one component could cause the failure of the other. The firm found it challenging to improve the suppliers' quality performance as it was difficult to trace the failures to specific components. Our analysis reveals that – (i) the impact of interdependence is governed by the supply chain structure: reducing the interdependence between components improves quality when suppliers provide the components, but reducing interdependence worsens quality when the firm manufactures the entire sub‐assembly; and (ii) the relation between interdependence and quality performance is moderated by factors such as penalties, production costs, and interdependence costs. Additionally, we find that quality performance is lower when the firm outsources the components than when the firm manufactures the entire sub‐assembly. We identify coordinating mechanisms that leverage incentives and penalties to bridge the quality performance gap.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fpoms.12700",""

This study addresses the question how the Réunion plume, especially in interaction with the Central Indian Ridge, created the complex crustal thickness pattern of the hotspot track. For this purpose, the mantle convection code ASPECT was used to design three‐dimensional numerical models, which consider the specific location of the plume underneath moving plates and surrounded by large‐scale mantle flow. The results show the crustal thickness pattern produced by the plume, which altogether agrees well with topographic maps. Especially two features are consistently reproduced by the models: the distinctive gap in the hotspot track between the Maldives and Chagos is created by the combination of the ridge geometry and plume‐ridge interaction; and the Rodrigues Ridge, a narrow crustal structure which connects the hotspot track and the Central Indian Ridge, appears as the surface expression of a long‐distance sublithospheric flow channel. This study therefore provides further insight how small‐scale surface features are generated by the complex interplay between mantle and lithospheric processes.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2F2017GC006875",""

We report a new assemblage of exceptionally preserved fossils from Alberta, Canada, the first marine Konservat-Lagerstätte described from the Jurassic of North America.

Paired bio- and chemostratigraphies show that Lagerstätte deposition occurred during the late Pliensbachian through early Toarcian, capturing the carbon isotope excursion associated with the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event. Therefore, the Panthalassan Ya Ha Tinda biota is coeval with Toarcian Lagerstätten from the Tethys Ocean (Posidonia Shale and Strawberry Bank). Comparisons among these deposits permit new insights into the diversity, ecology, and biogeography of Jurassic marine communities during a time of pronounced biological and environmental change (e.g., expanded subsurface anoxia, warming, and extinctions).

Using deposition rates between 0.9 and 6.0 nm/s, we prepared films about 5 μm thick and measured the dielectric properties via an interdigitated electrode cell onto which films were deposited. Samples prepared at Tdep = Tg display the dielectric behavior of the ordinary supercooled liquid. Films deposited at lower deposition temperatures show a high dielectric loss upon heating toward Tg, which decreases by a factor of about 12 by annealing at Tg = 162 K. This change is consistent with either a drop of the Kirkwood correlation factor, gk, by a factor of about 10, or an increase in the dielectric relaxation times, both being indicative of changes toward ring-like hydrogen-bonded structure characteristic of the ordinary liquid. We rationalize the high dielectric relaxation amplitude in the vapor deposited glass by suggesting that depositions at low temperature provide insufficient time for molecules to form ring-like supramolecular structures for which dipole moments cancel. Surprisingly, above Tg of the ordinary liquid, these vapor deposited films fail to completely recover the dielectric properties of the liquid obtained by supercooling. Instead, the dielectric relaxation remains slower and its amplitude much higher than that of the equilibrium liquid state, indicative of a structure that differs from the equilibrium liquid up to at least Tg + 40 K.","http://aip.scitation.org/doi/am-pdf/10.1063/1.4999300",""

Experiments were performed on a thin rectangular plate of 100 mm wing length flapping in air at a frequency of 15 Hz and stroke amplitude of 40°. The wing deformation as well as wing root loads were measured and showed good agreement with previously published data. A direct numerical simulation of the Navier–Stokes equation with exactly the same configuration, but at lower Reynolds number, provided full-field dataset for the development of data-driven reduced-order models. A modified proper orthogonal decomposition-Galerkin method, which includes extra terms to represent moving boundaries, was applied for reduced-order model development. It was found that the reduced-order model with only eight proper orthogonal decomposition modes was sufficient to show good correlation of loads with direct numerical simulations and experimentally measured trends.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1756829317708318",""

An evaluation was undertaken with the ERBB3/Her3‐specific antibody patritumab (P) either alone or with the ERBB1/epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor erlotinib (E) in combination with standard cytotoxic agents, cisplatin, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide, in pediatric sarcoma xenograft models that express receptors and ligands targeted by these agents. Procedures: Tumor models were selected based upon ERBB3 expression and phosphorylation, and ligand (heregulin) expression. Patritumab, E, or these agents combined was evaluated without or with concomitant cytotoxic agents using procedures developed by the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program. Results: Full doses of cytotoxic agents were tolerated when combined with P, whereas dose reductions of 25% (vincristine, cisplatin) or 50% (cyclophosphamide) were required when combined with P + E. Patritumab, E alone, or in combination did not significantly inhibit growth of any tumor model, except for Rh18 xenografts (E alone). Patritumab had no single‐agent activity and marginally enhanced the activity of vincristine and cisplatin only in Ewing sarcoma ES‐4. P + E did not increase the antitumor activity of vincristine or cisplatin, whereas dose‐reduced cyclophosphamide was significantly less active than cyclophosphamide administered at its maximum tolerated dose when combined with P + E. Conclusions: P had no single‐agent activity, although it marginally potentiated the activity of vincristine and cisplatin in one of three models studied. However, the addition of E necessitated dose reduction of each cytotoxic agent, abrogating the enhancement observed with P alone.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fpbc.26870",""

One method for suppressing combustion instability would be to suppress the receptivity of the shear layer to acoustic oscillations, severing the coupling mechanism between the acoustics and the flame. Previous work suggested that the existence of a precessing vortex core (PVC) may suppress the receptivity of the shear layer, and the goal of this study is to first, confirm that this suppression is occurring, and second, understand the mechanism by which the PVC suppresses the shear layer receptivity. In this paper, we couple experiment with linear stability analysis to determine whether a PVC can suppress shear layer receptivity to longitudinal acoustic modes in a non-reacting swirling flow at a range of swirl numbers. The shear layer response to the longitudinal acoustic forcing manifests as an m = 0 mode since the acoustic field is axisymmetric. The PVC has been shown both in experiment and linear stability analysis to have m = 1 and m = −1 modal content. By comparing the relative magnitude of the m = 0 and m = −1,1 modes, we quantify the impact that the PVC has on the shear layer response. The mechanism for shear layer response is determined using companion forced response analysis, where the shear layer disturbance growth rates mirror the experimental results. Differences in shear layer thickness and azimuthal velocity profiles drive the suppression of the shear layer receptivity to acoustic forcing.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/GT/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/GT2017-64691/2433412/v04bt04a036-gt2017-64691.pdf",""

In the current study, a sub-set of AL residents with dementia (n = 112) was utilized to examine whether marital status was associated with LOS in AL as this has received sparse attention in previous research despite studies suggesting that marital status influences LOS in other health-care and long-term care settings. The Andersen-Newman behavioral model was used as a conceptual framework for the basis of this study of LOS, marital status, and dementia in AL. We hypothesized that persons with dementia who were married would have longer LOS than unmarried persons with dementia in AL. Cox regression was used to examine the association between marital status and LOS in AL of residents with dementia and whether activities of daily living were related to discharge from AL settings among married and unmarried residents with dementia. Main effects for marital status and the interaction between marital status and mobility with LOS were examined.

Children who are exposed to Hg can present with a wide variety of symptoms, including acrodynia, tremor, excessive salivation, and psychiatric symptoms, including insomnia. However, endocrinologic manifestations from Hg exposure are less well known. This is a case report of a 12-year-old boy who presented with body rash, irritability, insomnia, and profuse sweating after returning from a summer camp. The child was initially managed in the outpatient setting, and the investigation was mainly targeted toward infectious etiology, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Lyme disease. He was eventually admitted to the hospital with altered mental status and was noted to have hyponatremia with serum sodium of 121 mEq/L. Thyroid studies also revealed elevated free thyroxine levels in the presence of normal triiodothyronine and thyrotropin. The patient developed hypertension and tachycardia, and was found to have elevated 24-hour vanillylmandelic acid and metanephrines. Finally, heavy metal measurements revealed a blood Hg level that was greater than the reference values of 0 to 9 ng/mL. Chelation treatment with 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate was subsequently initiated and over a period of 8 months his symptoms resolved and his thyroid function test returned to normal. This case highlights some of the challenges commonly encountered in identifying Hg exposure. More importantly, it illustrates that exposure to Hg should be considered in children who present with the symptoms and abnormal endocrinologic test results described in this report.","https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-pdf/doi/10.1542/peds.2016-1402/1064421/peds_20161402.pdf",""

In this study, we develop novel methods to distinguish liars from truth-tellers, and redesign rule-based expert systems to address such a problem. The four proposed methods are termed split tree (ST), consolidated tree (CT), value-based split tree (VST), and value-based consolidated tree (VCT), respectively. Among them, ST and CT aim to increase an expert system’s accuracy of recommendations, and VST and VCT attempt to reduce the misclassification cost resulting from incorrect recommendations. We observe that ST and VST are less efficient than CT and VCT in that ST and VST always require selected attribute values to be verified, whereas CT and VCT do not require value verification under certain input scenarios. We conduct experiments to compare the performances of the four proposed methods and two existing methods, i.e., the traditional true tree (TT) method that ignores input distortion and the knowledge modification (KM) method proposed in prior research. The results show that CT and ST consistently rank first and second, respectively, in maximizing the recommendation accuracy, and VCT and VST always lead to the lowest and second lowest misclassification cost. Therefore, CT and VCT should be the methods of choice in dealing with users’ lying behaviors. Furthermore, we find that KM is outperformed by not only the four proposed methods, but sometimes even by the TT method. This result further confirms the advantage necessity of differentiating liars from truth-tellers when both types of users exist in the population.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/ijoc.2016.0728",""

Our goal is to determine the production quantity, the stock level, and the renewable energy supply in each period such that the aggregate production cost (including energy) is minimized. We tackle this complex decision problem in three steps. First, we present a deterministic planning model to attain the desired green energy penetration level. Next, the deterministic model is extended to a multistage stochastic optimization model taking into account the uncertainties of renewables. Finally, we develop an efficient modified Benders decomposition algorithm to search for the optimal production schedule using a scenario tree. Numerical experiments are carried out to verify and validate the model integrity, and the potential of realizing high‐level renewables penetration in large manufacturing system is discussed and justified.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fpoms.12657",""

In a field study of working adults (Study 1) and an experimental study that manipulated peer abusive supervision (Study 2), we found that peer abusive supervision interacted with third parties' prevention focus to predict their performance effort such that peer abuse was positively related to third parties' performance effort only for those high on prevention focus.

Stakeholder input suggests that a reduction in groundwater use may be desirable in order to preserve the Ogallala Aquifer and extend its economic contribution to both the producer and the regional economy. In an endeavor to define the benefits and costs of water conservation policy, this research estimates measures of producer net profits and regional value added and places a monetary value on the conserved groundwater. The results of the models that assume the goal is to maximize producer profits, suggest that the Local Enhanced Management Areas (LEMAs) framework of groundwater management will provide benefits to both the agricultural producer and rural communities. Subarea 1 will receive the greatest benefit, increasing cumulative net revenue by 6.3%, while Subareas 2 and 3 increase cumulative net revenue by 2.1% and 2.7%, respectively. The results suggest that generally, the rural economy receives as much, if not more, benefits from groundwater conservation than the agricultural producer. Subareas 1, 2, and 3 generated 8.3%, 2.7%, and 1.8%, respectively, more cumulative value added under the LEMA scenario as compared to the Status Quo scenario. If Subarea 3 were to manage their groundwater based on implementing a LEMA plan and maximizing value added, cumulative value added would increase from a 1.8% gain to an increase of 18.7%.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fj.1936-704X.2017.03262.x",""

Materials and methods: This retrospective study evaluated treatment outcomes in 64 cats with splenic MCT. Cats were categorized into the following treatment groups: splenectomy (A, n = 20); splenectomy with chemotherapy (B, n = 20); chemotherapy alone (C, n = 15); or supportive care (D, n = 9). Results: Median tumor specific survival (MTSS) was: 856, 853, 244, 365 days for groups A, B, C, and D, respectively. The MTSS was not significantly different between the 4 groups. However, comparing cats that had splenectomy (A and B) versus those that did not (C and D), the MTSS was 856 and 342 days, respectively (p=0.008). None of the prognostic factors analyzed significantly influenced survival. Conclusion: Splenectomy (+/‐ chemotherapy) significantly prolongs survival in cats with mast cell tumors. The role of chemotherapy remains unknown.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fvco.12305",""

Stakeholders also completed a survey assessing their attribution styles. Results indicated that perceptions of blame were affected by the interaction of stakeholder role (i.e., active vs. passive) with attribution style (i.e., optimistic vs. pessimistic).
