We demonstrate that the use of pulsed mode reactive dc magnetron sputtering, adequate thermal budget, and careful control of a titanium seed layer were the key elements for producing usable coated cantilevers. This coating material takes advantage of the excellent adhesive properties of Ti with silicon and silicon oxide and the intrinsically hard and conductive properties of TiN. Hence, these coated cantilever and tip assemblies have promising advantages over standard cantilever and tip assemblies for many demanding atomic force microscopy applications. We were able to fabricate Ti/TiN coatings with negligible stress-induced bending of the delicate cantilevers. Tests to assess the performance of the Ti/TiN coatings were done on the tip assemblies and on sputter-coated blanket films on thermally oxidized silicon to obtain a measure of the film resistivity and thickness.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-pdf/18/3/1182/8204120/1182_1_online.pdf",""

For instance, the traditional audit/attest-reporting model may not provide adequate information to justify the cost of assurance services in some situations. Alternatively, potential clients may turn to other assurance providers who are willing to provide better quality services and/or more informative assurance reporting. In this study, we examine the impact of a two-tier reporting model on the market demand for assurance services on software product reliability. One tier uses the traditional binary report common with audit/attest services where a standard report notes whether a software product achieves a minimum standard, while the other tier of reporting provides for a graded assessment of multiple levels of quality. The results indicate that when a graded report that differentiates high-quality vendors from moderateor low-quality vendors is available (1) high-quality vendors are willing to pay for the report, (2) buyers are willing to pay a premium for the reduced risk associated with a highquality opinion, and (3) high-quality vendors are able to drive other vendors with inferior products out of the market. When only a binary report is available, the market is more confused and chaotic. Vendors are not able to signal quality clearly; the high-quality vendor is not able to dominate the market; there is less vendor demand for the assurance report; buyers are unable to determine their desired product and make less total profit. These results have several implications for the accounting profession and researchers as they work on the design of new assurance service models.","https://publications.aaahq.org/jis/article-pdf/14/s-1/65/9992/jis_2000_14_s-1_65.pdf",""

The dependence of the PL emission energy, linewidth, and intensity on temperature, in the low temperature regime, is consistent with recombination mechanisms involving bandtail states attributed to a small degree of interfacial disorder. The activation energy of the nonradiative centers in our superlattice agrees well with the value we derive for the width of the tail-state distribution. Moreover, we find that the average phonon energy of the phonons that control the interband PL energy at high temperatures is larger for the superlattice than for a high-quality GaN film. This observation is consistent with model calculations predicting the phonon mode properties of GaN–AlN-based wurtzite heterostructures.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article-pdf/76/15/1969/18548632/1969_1_online.pdf",""

Three desexualizing strategies were general ones, used by both male and female health care providers, and were employed regardless of the characteristics of the patients: engaging in conversation and nonsexual joking, meeting the patient clothed before the exam, and using medical rather than colloquial terms. Six strategies were used only in specific contexts or were used primarily by men or women. These gendered strategies include using a chaperone, objectifying the patient, empathizing with the patient, joking about sex, threatening the patient, and looking professional.

During this period, educational research has focused on the effectiveness of computers as both tools for teaching and as a replacement for more traditional instruction. This research has indicated that computer literacy can have a significant impact on a student's ability to learn in a computer-mediated environment. However, there is currently no widely accepted definition of computer literacy nor recent scale-to measure it. The definitions and scales that do exist are specific to the prevailing technology at the time of their development. Because of the rapidly changing face of technology, the current usefulness of these scales is limited with respect to graphical user interfaces. This study represents an effort to redefine computer literacy to include competencies for using graphical user interfaces for operating systems, hypermedia applications, and the Internet. The Computer Interface Literacy Measure (CILM) was developed and validated on 498 undergraduate students. The CILM is composed of both self-report (CILM-SR) and knowledge application (CILM-KA) sub-scales. The CILM-SR consists of twenty-six items, while the CILM-KA contains forty-two items. The Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the CILM-SR and CILM-KA were α = 0.8978 and α = 0.8455, respectively. The overall CILM had a reliability estimate of α = 0.9102, and was found to significantly correlate with Need for Cognition, a measure of computer instrumentality, and computer experience.

Nine resistance-trained men (25.0 ± 1.4 yr, 179.4 ± 3.4 cm, 79.7 ± 3.3 kg) were used to compare three 3-day treatments: control, Ex, and ethanol after exercise (ExEt). Blood was collected serially from an antecubital vein before exercise, immediately after exercise, and for pooled analysis at 20–40 (2 samples), 60–120 (4 samples), and 140–300 (9 samples) min after exercise on day 1 and in the morning (2 samples each) on days 2 and 3. Ethanol did not increase circulating epinephrine, norepinephrine, or cortisol concentration (Cort) above Ex elevations. At 60–120 min, only ExEt Cort was greater than control Cort. Concentrations of testosterone, luteinizing hormone, and corticotropin were not affected by either treatment. It is concluded that, although this blood ethanol concentration is insufficient to acutely increase Cort above that caused by Ex alone, it appears that ethanol may have a prolonged effect beyond the Ex response. This blood ethanol concentration does not further stimulate the sympathoadrenal system during the postexercise response.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jappl.2000.88.1.165",""

Hence, the thesis predicts high levels of success on foreign policy as well as differences between foreign and domestic policy. Looking at the trends in success on foreign and domestic votes, we observe that whereas the difference between foreign and domestic success rates shows up consistently for minority presidents, the absolute level of support on foreign and defense issues has declined since the second Reagan administration.

The current study serves to break new ground as the first systematic investigation of PCL:SV subcriteria by addressing their psychometric properties and exploring their construct and criterion-related validation. Previously unanalyzed data from three samples were integrated: female offenders, male forensic patients, and male adolescent offenders. Results largely support the use of subcriteria as homogeneous components of criteria and provide strong initial evidence of their construct validity. Results are less conclusive regarding criterion-related validity. For female offenders, they suggested the potential value of specific PCL:SV subcriteria for predicting verbal aggression.

In experiment 1, the channel amplitudes extracted from a six-channel continuous interleaved sampling (CIS) processor were quantized into 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 steps. Consonant recognition was assessed for five cochlear implant listeners, using the Med-El/CIS-link device, as a function of the number of steps in the electrical dynamic range. Results showed that eight steps within the dynamic range are sufficient for reaching asymptotic performance in consonant recognition. These results suggest that amplitude resolution is not a major factor in determining consonant identification. In experiment 2, the relationship between spectral resolution (number of channels) and intensity resolution (number of steps) in normal-hearing listeners was investigated. Speech was filtered through 4–20 frequency bands, synthesized as a linear combination of sine waves with amplitudes extracted from the envelopes of the bandpassed waveforms, and then quantized into 2–32 levels to produce stimuli with varying degrees of intensity resolution. Results showed that the number of steps needed to achieve asymptotic performance was a function of the number of channels and the speech material used. For vowels, asymptotic performance was obtained with four steps, while for consonants, eight steps were needed for most channel conditions, consistent with our findings in experiment 1. For sentences processed though 4 channels, 16 steps were needed to reach asymptotic performance, while for sentences processed through 16 channels, 4 steps were needed. The results with normal-hearing listeners on sentence recognition point to an inverse relationship between spectral resolution and intensity resolution. When spectral resolution is poor (i.e., a small number of channels is available) a relatively fine intensity resolution is needed to achieve high levels of understanding. Conversely, when the intensity resolution is poor, a high degree of spectral resolution is needed to achieve asymptotic performance. The results of this study, taken together with previous findings on the effect of reduced dynamic range, suggest that the performance of cochlear implant subjects is primarily limited by the small number (four to six) of channels received, and not by the small number of intensity steps or reduced dynamic range.","https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article-pdf/108/5/2377/12251339/2377_1_online.pdf",""

Converting surface pressure measurements to bottomhole is currently accomplished by locating the fluid level in the annulus using a sonic device and then applying a correlation to estimate the density of the gas-cut liquid column above the perforations. This gascut liquid column exhibits Zero Net Liquid Flow (ZNLF) conditions where the casing head gas flows through a nearly stagnant liquid. A review of literature reveals that the correlations currently in use by the industry are based on low pressure and low viscosity data. Increasingly, operators are encountering high viscosity fluids and in some instances, casinghead gas flows into gathering systems which are not the typical low pressure systems. This paper presents recent experimental measurements for ZNLF under high viscosity and pressure conditions. The results indicate that viscosity and pressure have a significant effect on the calculated bottomhole pressures and that these effects are not accounted for in the currently applied methods. New methods are presented to calculate multiphase density, i.e. gradient correction factor, under high viscosity and high pressure conditions.","https://onepetro.org/SPEATCE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/63047-MS/2960745/spe-63047-ms.pdf",""

Support for the major parties themselves has not eroded enough to provide a systemic opportunity for an independent candidate or for a new political party to end the Republican and Democratic duopoly.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/106591290005300303",""

The authors discuss the pattern of political development in these two nations and their theory of how and why values are changing from an authoritarian to libertarian set of attitudinal orientations. This pattern of value change has been eroding the traditional tolerance of the mass publics in these two nations for authoritarian and corrupt practices.

Experiment 1 examined speech recognition as a function of stimulation rate in six Med-El/CIS-Link cochlear implant listeners. Results showed that higher stimulation rates (2100 pulses/s) produced a significantly higher performance on word and consonant recognition than lower stimulation rates (&lt;800 pulses/s). The effect of stimulation rate on consonant recognition was highly dependent on the vowel context. The largest benefit was noted for consonants in the /uCu/ and /iCi/ contexts, while the smallest benefit was noted for consonants in the /aCa/ context. This finding suggests that the /aCa/ consonant test, which is widely used today, is not sensitive enough to parametric variations of implant processors. Experiment 2 examined vowel and consonant recognition as a function of pulse width for low-rate (400 and 800 pps) implementations of the CIS strategy. For the 400-pps condition, wider pulse widths (208 μs/phase) produced significantly higher performance on consonant recognition than shorter pulse widths (40 μs/phase). Experiments 3–5 examined vowel and consonant recognition as a function of the filter overlap in the analysis filters, shape of the amplitude mapping function, and signal bandwidth. Results showed that the amount of filter overlap (ranging from −20 to −60 dB/oct) and the signal bandwidth (ranging from 6.7 to 9.9 kHz) had no effect on phoneme recognition. The shape of the amplitude mapping functions (ranging from strongly compressive to weakly compressive) had only a minor effect on performance, with the lowest performance obtained for nearly linear mapping functions. Of the five speech processing parameters examined in this study, the pulse rate and the pulse width had the largest (positive) effect on speech recognition. For a fixed pulse width, higher rates (2100 pps) of stimulation provided a significantly better performance on word recognition than lower rates (&lt;800 pps) of stimulation. High performance was also achieved by jointly varying the pulse rate and pulse width. The above results indicate that audiologists can optimize the implant listener’s performance either by increasing the pulse rate or by jointly varying the pulse rate and pulse width.","https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article-pdf/108/2/790/7518795/790_1_online.pdf",""

Most principals perceived significant differences in second year beginning teachers’ capacities related to their knowledge, skill, disposition, and sense of self. Principals credited traditionally certified teachers’ greater levels of capacity to their preservice programs and recognized the benefits of broader work experience and knowledge of the alternatively certified teachers. Findings revealed that principals used similar assessment methods, but alternatively certified teachers required additional forms of assessment. While principals used similar capacity-building strategies with both groups they provided more guidance to alternatively certified teachers on matters of instruction.

Efficient procedures are widely available for determining least time paths in deterministic networks. In stochastic but time-invariant networks, least expected time paths can be determined by setting each random arc weight to its expected value and solving an equivalent deterministic problem. This paper addresses the problem of determining least expected time paths in stochastic, time-varying networks. Two procedures are presented. The first procedure determines the a priori least expected time paths from all origins to a single destination for each departure time in the peak period. The second procedure determines lower bounds on the expected times of these a priori least expected time paths. This procedure determines an exact solution for the problem where the driver is permitted to react to revealed travel times on traveled links en route, i.e., in a time-adaptive route choice framework. Modifications to each of these procedures for determining least expected cost (where cost is not necessarily travel time) paths and lower bounds on the expected costs of these paths are given. Extensive numerical tests are conducted to illustrate the algorithms' computational performance as well as the properties of the solution.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/trsc.34.2.198.12304",""

We focus on defense contract awards because of their rapid turn-around. We advance the referendum model to account for variations in the timing of defense contracts within administrations. The referendum model posits that government policies are reflective of approval ratings and that the President uses defense contracts to counter sagging approval and/or a weak economy This is a subtle but important alternative to political business cycle (PBC) models which constrain political manipulation of the defense budget to the electoral cycle. An empirical model is tested using pooled time-series analysis which allows us to assess variation within administrations.

Separate models for immigrants and natives reveal that education, occupation, and metropolitan location have a large positive effect on the earnings of native-born Mexican men but no significant effect on immigrants. For immigrants, work experience in the United States increases earnings. Working in manufacturing and living in the South significantly decrease the earnings of immigrants. However, both benefit substantially from union membership.

We review a broad set of recent empirical work in the context of three models of policymaking: principal-agent theory, Gormley's salience and complexity model, and Lowry's dimensions of federalism model. The relative effectiveness of the three approaches in explaining the dynamics of political controls or influences over state-level regulation is assessed in order to point to future theoretic directions for the field.

Therefore, methods that are able to rapidly and accurately describe aggregate angularity are valuable in the design process of asphalt mixtures. Two computer-automated procedures, which make use of the advances in digital-image processing, to quantify fine aggregate angularity, are presented. The first method relies on the concepts of the erosion-dilation techniques. This consists of subjecting the aggregate surface to a smoothing effect that causes the angularity elements to disappear from the image. Then, the area lost as a result of the smoothing effect is calculated and used to quantify angularity. The second method is based on the fractal approach. Image-analysis techniques are used to measure the fractal length of aggregate boundary. The fractal length increases with aggregate angularity. The proposed imaging techniques are used to capture the aggregate angularity of 23 sand samples that represent a wide range of materials. The results are compared with visual analysis and indirect methods of measuring fine-aggregate angularity, such as the uncompacted air voids, and the angle of internal friction of aggregate mass. In general, the results indicate much promise for measuring aggregate properties using automated imaging technologies.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/1721-08",""

We analyze a sample of taxable corporate acquisitions, including acquisitions of subsidiaries, private firms, and public firms, occurring over the period 1990 through 1996. We assess the impact of the goodwill legislation by (1) quantifying the frequency and size of qualifying acquisitions and comparing these acquisitions to nonqualifying acquisitions pre- and post-OBRA and (2) investigating if and how the goodwill amortization deduction influenced the premium paid for qualifying corporate acquisitions. We estimate a regression of acquisition premiums on target-firm characteristics including a proxy for purchased goodwill. We find that acquisitions qualifying for goodwill amortization comprise less than 17 percent of sample taxable corporate acquisitions before OBRA, and this percentage does not increase after the enactment of OBRA. Nonetheless, our regression results indicate that the OBRA goodwill provisions did contribute to a significant increase in acquisition premiums associated with purchased goodwill for qualifying transactions. Thus, rather than operate as a subsidy to acquiring firms, we find that a majority of the tax benefits associated with the goodwill amortization deduction accrues to target-firm shareholders.","https://publications.aaahq.org/jata/article-pdf/22/s-1/34/66093/jata_2000_22_s-1_34.pdf",""

CASE SUMMARY:: A 54-year-old African-American woman developed severe glucose dysregulation 12 days after the initiation of olanzapine. Prior to starting olanzapine therapy, the patient's diabetes was controlled by diet modification with a glycosylated hemoglobin of 6.5%. During olanzapine therapy, blood glucose concentrations could not be regulated despite use of antidiabetic agents, insulin, and dietary interventions. The patient also gained a total of 13 kg. Two weeks after discontinuation of all antipsychotic medications (olanzapine, quetiapine), the patient's blood glucose concentrations became better regulated and remained better controlled until discharge. DISCUSSION:: All atypical antipsychotics are associated with weight gain. Obesity is a well-documented risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. Currently there are only six published reports that implicate olanzapine as being associated with glucose dysregulation. The exact cause of glucose dysregulation with olanzapine is unclear, but weight gain does not seem to be the sole etiology. It has been hypothesized that serotonin (5-HT CONCLUSIONS:: Although olanzapine has shown greater clinical efficacy and is associated with fewer extrapyramidal side effects than typical antipsychotics, it may produce exacerbation or new emergence of diabetes mellitus.

Results supported the hypothesis that girls suppress anger at higher rates than boys but not the related hypothesis that this suppression results in higher levels of depression.

In this approach, trajectories are integrated for N fluid elements (particles) moving under the influence of both the force from the potential surface and from the quantum potential. In this study, distributed approximating functionals (DAFs) are used on a uniform grid to compute the necessary derivatives in the equations of motion. Transformations between the physical grid where the particle coordinates are defined and the uniform grid are handled through a Jacobian, which is also computed using DAFs. A difficult problem associated with computing derivatives on finite grids is the edge problem. This is handled effectively by using DAFs within a least squares approach to extrapolate from the known function region into the neighboring regions. The QTM–DAF is then applied to wave packet transmission through a one-dimensional Eckart potential. Emphasis is placed upon computation of the transmitted density and wave function. A problem that develops when part of the wave packet reflects back into the reactant region is avoided in this study by introducing a potential ramp to sweep the reflected particles away from the barrier region.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/112/24/10730/19044621/10730_1_online.pdf",""

Whether slack is beneficial or costly to an organization has been the subject of debate.

The benefit of slack is that it can serve as a motivational tool. The possibility of increasing his slack may encourage a self-interested manager to conduct a more diligent search for a profitable project. To trade off the costs and benefits of slack in our model, an optimal information system sometimes incorporates coarse information, late information, and a mix of monitored and self-reported information. These features are familiar to accountants. Accounting incorporates both verified (monitored) and unverified (self-reported) information and provides information that is aggregated (coarse) and historical (late).","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mnsc.46.2.205.11927",""

Methods.: Longitudinal follow-up of children occurred in 2 cohorts of the Multicenter Cryotherapy for Retinopathy of Prematurity Study. The extended natural history cohort followed 1199 survivors of &lt;1251 g birth weight from 5 centers. The threshold randomized cohort (ThRz) followed 255 infants &lt;1251 g from 23 centers who developed threshold ROP and who consented to cryotherapy to not more than 1 eye.

Results.: Evaluations were completed on 88.7% of the extended natural history cohort; 87% had globally normal functional skills (WeeFIM: &gt;95). As ROP severity increased, rates of severe disability increased from 3.7% among those with no ROP, to 19.7% of those with threshold ROP.

Although the TxMLS has been used successfully to test in-service pavements in the Yoakum and Fort Worth districts, the fact that only one TxMLS machine exists limits the number of accelerated pavement tests (APT) that can be performed. Therefore, TxDOT is evaluating a modification of the rolling dynamic deflectometer (RDD) for use as a super-accelerated pavement tester. In this application, the truck-mounted dynamic loading system is operated in a stationary mode, with the loading rollers and rolling sensors of the RDD removed from operation. The servohydraulic actuator is used for application of harmonic loading to a wheel footprint on the pavement surface. Hundreds of thousands of load repetitions are applied in a matter of hours; hence the designation as super-accelerated testing. This stationary dynamic deflectometer (SDD) is being studied as a possible tool for use in expanding TxDOT’s APT program. The SDD may allow TxDOT to increase, in a cost-effective manner, the number of accelerated tests that can be performed. Preliminary tests have been performed with the TxMLS and SDD on two different pavement recycling strategies constructed on the northbound and southbound lanes of US-281 in the Fort Worth District. That the same conclusion was reached about the relative performance of the test sections with both machines indicates the potential usefulness of the SDD.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/1716-12",""

However, problems differentiating the subspecies by morphological measurements alone and a recent range expansion have led to questions about their systematic status and population structure. We evaluated both morphological characters and a 289 base-pair segment of the mitochondrial control region from 183 White-winged Doves taken from 31 locations in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. Twenty-seven variable base changes were observed, which resulted in 44 haplotypes. An analysis of haplotypes yielded little phylogenetic signal; however, analyses of haplotype frequencies indicated geographic heterogeneity between doves collected in the four historic subspecies ranges. Doves from the range expansion areas were intermediate in size and genetically homogenous. Morphological analyses suggested congruency between control region variation and body size. Our data support the recognition of two subspecies of White-winged Doves with a zone of intergradation in the range expansion areas. The dispersal of White-winged Doves into the expansion areas appears to be a congruent process by both subspecies.","http://academic.oup.com/condor/article-pdf/102/4/871/29709902/condor0871.pdf",""

Off-road vehicles experience large suspension displacements, where the nonlinear kinematics and damping characteristics of suspension elements are significant. These nonlinearities tend to degrade the performance of active suspension systems, introducing harshness to the ride quality and reducing off-road mobility. Typical control strategies rely on linear, time-invariant models of the suspension dynamics. While these models are convenient, nominally accurate, and tractable due to the abundance of linear control techniques, they neglect the nonlinearities and time-varying dynamics present in real suspension systems. One approach to improving the effectiveness of active vehicle suspension systems, while preserving the benefits of linear control techniques, is to identify and cancel these nonlinearities using Feedback Linearization. In this paper the authors demonstrate an intelligent parameter estimation approach using structured artificial neural networks that continually “learns” the nonlinear parameter variations of a quarter-car suspension model. This estimation algorithm becomes the foundation for an Intelligent Feedback Linearization (IFL) controller for active vehicle suspensions. Results are presented for computer simulations, real-time experimental tests, and field evaluations using an off-road vehicle (a military HMMWV). Experimental results for a quarter-car test rig demonstrate 60% improvements in ride quality relative to baseline (non-adapting) control algorithms. Field trial results reveal 95% reductions in absorbed power and 65% reductions in peak sprung mass acceleration using this IFL approach versus conventional passive suspensions.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/dynamicsystems/article-pdf/123/4/727/5514449/712_1.pdf",""

The code is based on a stream function model and a finite element solution procedure. A new design system has been developed which optimizes hub and shroud geometry and inlet and exit flow-field parameters for each blade row of a multistage axial flow turbine. Optimization was performed using our hybrid constrained optimization code that includes the following modules: genetic algorithm, simulated annealing, modified simplex method, sequential quadratic programming, and a gradient search algorithm. Switching among the modules was performed automatically. By varying a relatively small number of geometric variables per each turbine stage it is possible to find an optimal radial distribution of flow parameters at the inlet and outlet of every blade row. Thus, an optimized meridional flow path can be found that is defined by the optimized shape of the hub and shroud. The multistage design optimization system has been demonstrated using an actual two-stage axial gas turbine as an example. The comparison of computed performance of an already very high efficiency initial design and its optimized design demonstrates more than one percent improvement in the turbine efficiency at design and significant off-design conditions. The entire design optimization process is feasible on a typical single-processor computer workstation or a personal computer.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/GT/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/2000-GT-0521/4222335/v001t03a086-2000-gt-0521.pdf",""

Diseased roots appeared light brown and brittle with strands of dark brown septate runner hyphae along the surface of the root axis and olivaceous brown growth cessation structures within the cortical tissue. Overall, symptoms were more severe on crowns and nodes than roots. A Gaeumannomyces fungus was isolated from root, sheath, and bud tissues. Taxonomy of the fungus was consistent with the description of G. graminis var. graminis by Walker (1,2). Diseased plants were washed free of soil and other debris and maintained in a moist chamber for 14 days. Perithecia were formed on leaf sheaths. Morphology of perithecia, asci, and ascospores was consistent with Walker's description of perithecia, asci, and ascospores of G. graminis var. graminis (2). Leaf buds and root tissue, colonized by G. graminis var. graminis, were plated directly onto potato-dextrose agar containing streptomycin sulfate and rifampicin (100 ppm, respectively). Colonies of sparse white, slightly aerial mycelium turning olive brown with age and producing lobed hyphopodia, developed from plated plant material. Hyphae at the margin of colonies curled back, characteristic of G. graminis var. graminis. Symptoms reported here are similar to those described by Wilkinson and Kane (3); however, the season and prevailing environmental conditions were different.","https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/abs/10.1094/PDIS.2000.84.10.1151C",""

Symptomatic plants with multiple lesions were found at low frequencies in dense J. ashei populations. Orange telia formed on scales and bark and on 2- to 3-mm-diameter twigs and became nearly inconspicuous when dry. No hypertrophy was observed. Previously reported telial hosts include J. californica and J. excelsa cv. Stricta in California; J. mexicana and J. scopulorum in Oklahoma; J. virginiana in Texas; and J. deppeana var. pachyphloea in Oklahoma and Texas (1). An aecial stage identified as G. exiguum has been observed for many years on native hawthorns (Crataegus crus-galli, C. greggiana, C. mollis, C. stevensiana, C. tracyi, C. turnerorum, C. viridis var. desertorum, and several natural hybrids) in Bandera, Bexar, Edwards, Gillespie, Kendall, Kimble, Real, and Uvalde counties, Texas. Prominent roestelioid aecia were observed on hawthorn leaves, petioles, fruits, peduncles, thorns, and, less often, on twigs. In two experimental plantings of hawthorns in Bandera County, rust severity was rated as low to moderate in six populations of C. greggiana and hybrids; moderate in two populations each of C. stevensiana and C. tracyi; moderate to severe in three populations of C. crus-galli and hybrids; and severe in one population each of C. mollis and C. viridis var. desertorum. G. exiguum was previously reported on a Crataegus sp. in Texas and on Heteromeles arbutifolia in California (1). Flowers, fruits, plant forms, and drought tolerances are characteristics of some endemic hawthorns that provide landscape and wildlife advantages. G. exiguum causing rust disease may limit the ornamental potential of highly susceptible hawthorn species in southwest Texas. Inconspicuous infections on susceptible ornamental Juniperus spp. also could have phytosanitary implications.

By contrast, the search for specific genes that regulate bone mass has progressed rather slowly, and the results are more difficult to interpret and reproduce. This article reviews the genetics of osteoporosis and problems plaguing genetic research. It is argued that the search for genes involved in the expression of osteoporotic phenotypes should be based on linkage studies in relatively homogeneous populations. Strategies for increasing the power of studies, such as making use of information from extended pedigrees and multivariate analysis, are discussed. With the advent of a comprehensive human genetic linkage map, a complete identification of genes for osteoporosis appears feasible. Understanding the genetic mechanisms and their interactions with environmental factors should allow more focused and cost-effective osteoporosis prevention and treatment strategies.","https://academic.oup.com/jbmr/article-pdf/15/3/392/56602967/5650150302.pdf",""

Previous studies in rats and pigs have shown that the feeding-induced stimulation of protein synthesis is associated with activation of the 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K1) as well as enhanced binding of eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4E to eIF4G to form the active eIF4F complex. In cells in culture, hormones and nutrients regulate both of these events through a protein kinase termed the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). In the present study, the involvement of mTOR in the feeding-induced stimulation of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle and liver was examined. Pigs at 7 days of age were fasted for 18 h, and then one-half of the animals were fed. In addition, one-half of the animals in each group were administered rapamycin (0.75 mg/kg) 2 h before feeding. The results reveal that treating 18-h fasted pigs with rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR, before feeding prevented the activation of S6K1 and the changes in eIF4F complex formation observed in skeletal muscle and liver after feeding. Rapamycin also ablated the feeding-induced stimulation of protein synthesis in liver. In contrast, in skeletal muscle, rapamycin attenuated, but did not prevent, the stimulation of protein synthesis in response to feeding. The results suggest that feeding stimulates hepatic protein synthesis through an mTOR-dependent process involving enhanced eIF4F complex formation and activation of S6K1. However, in skeletal muscle, these two processes may account for only part of the stimulation of protein synthesis, and thus additional steps may be involved in the response.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpendo.2000.279.5.E1080",""

It demonstrates that one can construct a virtual quasi-steady periodic experiment from a limited but properly selected set of transient non-periodic data. In the spectral domain, the phase angles of the responses at different locations relative to a periodic input signal depend on the thermophysical properties. For the purpose of this evaluation, the transient temperature responses to a surface heat flux input are analytically obtained at pre-selected sensor locations. The transient data are converted to periodic data, phase angles are computed, and thermophysical properties are estimated.

The use of mineral fillers such as hydrated lime is known to provide a decrease in moisture susceptibility. In many cases, mineral fillers will also increase the mixture stiffness. Conventional asphaltic concrete mixtures and mixtures modified with hydrated lime were evaluated for their fundamental engineering properties as defined by indirect tensile strength and strain, permanent deformation characteristics, resilient modulus, and fatigue resistance. A typical Louisiana low-volume dense-graded mixture was used. The test factorial included two aggregate types (limestone and gravel) and two asphalt cement types (a conventional AC-30 and one modified with styrene-butadiene polymer). The results indicated that the addition of hydrated lime as mineral filler improved the permanent deformation characteristics and fatigue endurance of the asphaltic concrete mixtures. This improvement was particularly apparent at higher testing temperatures with mixes containing polymer-modified asphalt and limestone aggregate.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/1723-04",""

Earlier analyses had indicated that recombination was common but concentrated into a hotspot and that recurrent mutations at multiple sites may have occurred. We show that much evolutionary structure exists in the haplotype variation on either side of the recombinational hotspot. By peeling off significant recombination events from a tree estimated under the null hypothesis of no recombination, we also reveal some cladistic structure not disrupted by recombination during the time to coalescence of this variation. Additional cladistic structure is estimated to have emerged after recombination. Many apparent multiple mutational events at sites still remain after removing the effects of the detected recombination/gene conversion events. These apparent multiple events are found primarily at sites identified as highly mutable by previous studies, strengthening the conclusion that they are true multiple events. This analysis portrays the complexity of the interplay among many recombinational and mutational events that would be needed to explain the patterns of haplotype diversity in this gene. The cladistic structure in this region is used to identify four to six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that would provide disequilibrium coverage over much of this region. These sites may be useful in identifying phenotypic associations with variable sites in this gene. Evolutionary considerations also imply that the SNPs in the 3′ region should have general utility in most human populations, but the 5′ SNPs may be more population specific. Choosing SNPs at random would generally not provide adequate disequilibrium coverage of the sequenced region.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/156/3/1259/42033863/genetics1259.pdf",""

The discussion is focused on the challenge in developing materials with low dielectric constant but strong thermomechanical properties. This is followed by a description of the material characterization techniques, including several recently developed for porous materials.

Patients were categorized as having poor glucose control if 40 per cent or more of all plasma glucose determinations were 7·8 mmol l−1 or greater and were compared with patients with adequate glucose control (less than 40 per cent of glucose values 7·8 mmol l−1 or greater). Results: Despite similar age, burn size and caloric intake, the extent and severity of hyperglycaemia was significantly greater in the 33 patients categorized as having poor glucose control than in the 25 patients with adequate glucose control. Patients with hyperglycaemia had a significantly higher proportion of blood cultures positive for yeast (mean(s.d.) 3·7(10·0) versus 0·1(0·7) per cent; P &lt; 0·05, Student's t test). Nine of 33 patients with persistent hyperglycaemia died, compared with only one of 25 with adequate glucose control (P ≤ 0·05, Fisher's exact test). Conclusion: This association between hyperglycaemia, fungaemia and subsequent death in severely burned children may be related to a hyperglycaemia-induced deterioration in immune function. This suggests that aggressive manoeuvres to normalize plasma glucose may be warranted.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1046%2Fj.1365-2168.2000.01544-19.x",""

The second is a thin AlN (1.5 nm) buffer layer. X-ray diffraction confirms (0001) growth orientation, smooth interfaces, and coherence lengths comparable to the layer thickness in both samples. In the case of the thin AlN buffer layer, the tensile stress measured by the E2 Raman line shift is attributed to the mismatch in the thermal expansion coefficients of GaN and Si. However, when the AlGaN/GaN superlattice buffer layer is grown first, a reduced stress is measured. High carrier concentrations (≈1018 cm−3) are seen in the GaN grown on the thin AlN buffer layer, which we attribute to the incorporation of silicon from the substrate during the growth process. The superlattice buffer layer is seen to inhibit this diffusion, resulting in a carrier concentration of &lt;1017 cm−3 in the GaN.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article-pdf/76/14/1842/18548514/1842_1_online.pdf",""

To determine if this reduced gene activation involves signal transduction pathways dependent on salicylic acid (SA) and/or jasmonic acid (JA), we compared the responses of NE-388 and an ozone-tolerant clone, NE-245, to these signal molecules. JA levels increased in both clones in response to ozone, but only minimal increases in SA levels were measured for either clone. Treatment with SA and methyl jasmonate induced defense gene expression only in NE-245, indicating that NE-388 is insensitive to these signal molecules. DNA fragmentation, an indicator of programmed cell death (PCD), was detected in NE-245 treated with either ozone or an avirulent phytopathogen, but was not detected in NE-388. We conclude that these clones undergo two distinct mechanisms of ozone-induced lesion formation. In NE-388, lesions appear to be due to toxic cell death resulting from a limited ability to perceive and subsequently activate SA- and/or JA-mediated antioxidant defense responses. In NE-245, SA-dependent PCD precedes lesion formation via a process related to the PCD pathway activated by phytopathogenic bacteria. These results support the hypothesis that ozone triggers a hypersensitive response.","http://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-pdf/123/2/487/38672659/plphys_v123_2_487.pdf",""

The first reported example of oncocytoma in a melanocytoma of the spinal cord was successfully excised, and its pathological appearance is described. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 71-year-old woman presented with a 25-year history of back pain and myelographic evidence of a lumbar spinal cord mass. After declining surgical treatment for two decades, she elected eventually to have the mass excised. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large intraspinal mass that spanned spinal levels L3 through S1. TECHNIQUE: The mass was excised en bloc through posterior laminectomies, and histopathological analysis revealed a benign neoplasm composed predominantly of monotonous sheets of plump oncocytes. Electron microscopy confirmed that the cytoplasm of the oncocytes was packed full of mitochondria. Focal areas of the tumor contained spindle cells, with abundant intracytoplasmic granular deposits of brown melanin pigment that contained melanosomes. Positive Fontana-Masson, HMB-45, and S-100 staining confirmed the final diagnosis of melanocytoma, oncocytic variant. CONCLUSION: The first reported case of oncocytoma arising in spinal melanocytoma is described. After surgical excision, the patient recovered completely and has remained free of symptoms for 4 years.","http://academic.oup.com/neurosurgery/article-pdf/47/3/756/32549121/00006123-200009000-00046.pdf",""

Two HME disease genes, EXT1 and EXT2, have been identified and are expressed ubiquitously. However, the only known effect of mutations in the EXT genes is on chondrocyte function as evidenced by aberrant proliferation of chondrocytes leading to formation of bony, cartilage-capped projections (exostoses). In this study, we have characterized exostosis chondrocytes from three patients with HME (one with EXT1 and two with EXT2 germline mutations) and from one individual with a non-HME, isolated exostosis. At the light microscopic level, exostosis chondrocytes have a stellate appearance with elongated inclusions in the cytoplasm. Confocal and immunofluorescence of in vitro and in vivo chondrocytes showed that these massive accumulations are composed of actin bundled by 1.5-μm repeat cross-bridges of α-actinin. Western blot analysis shows that exostosis chondrocytes from two out of three patients aberrantly produce high levels of muscle-specific α-actin, whereas β-actin levels are similar to normal chondrocytes. These findings suggest that mutations in the EXT genes cause abnormal processing of cytoskeleton proteins in chondrocytes.","https://academic.oup.com/jbmr/article-pdf/15/3/442/56603749/5650150307.pdf",""

There is, at this time, no functional photoresist suitable for 157 nm exposure. Developing resist materials for 157 nm lithography is particularly challenging since water, oxygen, and even polyethylene are strongly absorbing at this wavelength. A modular approach to the design of a single layer resist for 157 nm has been undertaken. In this approach, the resist has been conceptually segmented into four functional modules: an acidic group, an acid labile protecting group, an etch resistant moiety, and a polymer backbone. Each of these modules has an assigned function and each must be transparent at 157 nm. Progress has been made toward finding candidate structures for each of these modules. We have demonstrated that acidic bistrifluoromethylcarbinols are very transparent at 157 nm and function efficiently in chemically amplified resists with both high and low activation energy protecting groups. Judicious incorporation of fluorine in acrylates and alicyclics has provided etch resistant polymers with greatly improved transparency at 157 nm. In particular, esters of poly(α-trifluromethylacrylic acid) are far more transparent than their protio analogs. The Diels–Alder adducts derived from reaction of these and other fluorinated alkenes with cyclopentadiene offer a route to a wide range of alicyclic monomers that show great promise as transparent, etch resistant platforms for the design of 157 nm resists. Polymers of this sort with absorbance below 2 per micrometer are reported.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-pdf/18/6/3396/8205905/3396_1_online.pdf",""

Bromocriptine modulates neurotransmitter action in the brain and has been shown to improve glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in animal models of obesity and diabetes. We studied the effect of a quick-release bromocriptine formulation on glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in obese type 2 diabetic subjects. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: There were 22 obese subjects with type 2 diabetes randomized to receive a quick-release formulation of bromocriptine (n = 15) or placebo (n = 7) in a 16-week double-blind study. Subjects were prescribed a weight-maintaining diet to exclude any effect of changes in body weight on the primary outcome measurements. Fasting plasma glucose concentration and HbA(1c) were measured at 2- to 4-week intervals during treatment. Body composition (underwater weighing), body fat distribution (magnetic resonance imaging), oral glucose tolerance (oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT]), insulin-mediated glucose disposal, and endogenous glucose production (2-step euglycemic insulin clamp, 40 and 160 mU x min(-1) x m(-2)) were measured before and after treatment. RESULTS: No changes in body weight or body composition occurred during the study in either placebo- or bromocriptine-treated subjects. Bromocriptine significantly reduced HbA(1c) (from 8.7 to 8.1%, P = 0.009) and fasting plasma glucose (from 190 to 172 mg/dl, P = 0.02) levels, whereas these variables increased during placebo treatment (from 8.5 to 9.1%, NS, and from 187 to 223 mg/dl, P = 0.02, respectively). The differences in HbA(1c) (delta = 1.2%, P = 0.01) and fasting glucose (delta = 54 mg/dl, P &lt; 0.001) levels between the bromocriptine and placebo group at 16 weeks were highly significant. The mean plasma glucose concentration during OGTT was significantly reduced by bromocriptine (from 294 to 272 mg/dl, P = 0.005), whereas it increased in the placebo group. No change in glucose disposal occurred during the first step of the insulin clamp in either the bromocriptine- or placebo-treated group. During the second insulin clamp step, bromocriptine improved total glucose disposal from 6.8 to 8.4 mg x min(-1) kg(-1) fat-free mass (FFM) (P = 0.01) and nonoxidative glucose disposal from 3.3 to 4.3 mg min(-1) x kg(-1) FFM (P &lt; 0.05), whereas both of these variables deteriorated significantly (P &lt; or = 0.02) in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Bromocriptine improves glycemic control and glucose tolerance in obese type 2 diabetic patients. Both reductions in fasting and postprandial plasma glucose levels appear to contribute to the improvement in glucose tolerance. The bromocriptine-induced improvement in glycemic control is associated with enhanced maximally stimulated insulin-mediated glucose disposal.","https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/23/8/1154/451032/10937514.pdf",""

Previous studies using MG63 osteoblast-like cells, hypothesized to be at a relatively immature maturation state, showed that proliferation was inhibited and differentiation (osteocalcin production) was stimulated by culture on titanium (Ti) surfaces of increasing roughness. This effect was further enhanced by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3]. In the present study, we examined the response of three additional cell lines at three different maturation states: fetal rat calvarial (FRC) cells (a mixture of multipotent mesenchymal cells, osteoprogenitor cells, and early committed osteoblasts), OCT-1 cells (well-differentiated secretory osteoblast-like cells isolated from calvaria), and MLO-Y4 cells (osteocyte-like cells). Both OCT-1 and MLO-Y4 cells were derived from transgenic mice transformed with the SV40 large T-antigen driven by the osteocalcin promoter. Cells were cultured on Ti disks with three different average surface roughnesses (Ra): PT, 0.5 μm; SLA, 4.1 μm; and TPS, 4.9 μm. When cultures reached confluence on plastic, vehicle or 10−7 M or 10−8 M 1,25(OH)2D3 was added for 24 h to all of the cultures. At harvest, cell number, alkaline phosphatase-specific activity, and production of osteocalcin, transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were measured. Cell behavior was sensitive to surface roughness and depended on the maturation state of the cell line. Fetal rat calvarial (FRC) cell number and alkaline phosphatase-specific activity were decreased, whereas production of osteocalcin, TGF-β1, and PGE2 were increased with increasing surface roughness. Addition of 1,25(OH)2D3 to the cultures further augmented the effect of roughness for all parameters in a dose-dependent manner; only TGF-β1 production on plastic and PT was unaffected by 1,25(OH)2D3. OCT-1 cell number and alkaline phosphatase (SLA &gt; TPS) were decreased and production of PGE2, osteocalcin, and TGF-β1 were increased on SLA and TPS. Response to 1,25(OH)2D3 varied with the parameter being measured. Addition of the hormone to the cultures had no effect on cell number or TGF-β1 production on any surface, while alkaline phosphatase was stimulated on SLA and TPS; osteocalcin production was increased on all Ti surfaces but not on plastic; and PGE2 was decreased on plastic and PT, but unaffected on SLA and TPS.

Two important pathways that lead to host cell activation and LPS deactivation involve: (i) LPS interactions with CD14 and Toll-like receptor 4 on cells (activation); and (ii) LPS sequestration by plasma lipoproteins (deactivation). Whereas these pathways were previously thought to be independent and essentially irreversible, we found that they are connected by a third pathway: (iii) the movement of LPS from host cells to plasma lipoproteins. Our data show that, in the presence of human plasma, LPS binds transiently to monocyte surfaces and then moves from the cell surface to plasma lipoproteins. Soluble CD14 enhances LPS release from cells in the presence of lipoproteins, whereas LPS binding protein and phospholipid transfer protein do not. The transfer of cell-bound LPS to lipoproteins is accompanied by reduced cell responses to the LPS, suggesting that the movement of LPS from leukocytes into lipoproteins may attenuate host responses to LPS in vivo. Preliminary data suggest that changes that occur in the plasma after trauma or during sepsis decrease LPS binding to leukocytes while greatly increasing the rate of LPS release from cells.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/09680519000060061101",""

The aim of this study was to develop a standardized and reproducible model of sepsis after smoke inhalation in sheep. Methods: Merino ewes (n = 21) were surgically prepared for the study. Five to seven days later, animals received a tracheostomy and 48 breaths of cotton smoke. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was suspended in 30 ml saline, which contained 2–5 × 1011 colony-forming units, and injected into the right lobe (20 ml) and into the left lobe (10 ml) using a bronchoscope. After the bacterial challenge, the animals were ventilated mechanically with 100 per cent oxygen. Body temperature, haemodynamic parameters, blood gas and blood culture were monitored for 48 h. Results: The sheep showed a hyperkinetic response and fall in arterial partial pressure of oxygen similar to that seen in severe sepsis in humans. These changes were more severe than in animals with smoke inhalation alone (Fig. 1). Conclusion: This would be a good animal model of sepsis and ARDS.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1046%2Fj.1365-2168.2000.01544-67.x",""

The ring-puckering levels for the S1(π,π*) electronic state were determined for both the flapping ground (vF=0) and excited states (vF=1) and these were used to calculate both one- and two-dimensional potential energy surfaces which fit the observed spectra. In the S1(π,π*) state phthalan was found to be planar and more rigid than in the ground state in terms of the puckering coordinate. However, the molecule is less rigid along the flapping coordinate.

Theory and measurements are reported. The ragged edge is modeled as N arcs, of differing radii ai, each of which contributes a scattered signal to the edge wave on axis behind the aperture or disk. The amplitude of each scattered signal is proportional to the angle of the arc, and the corresponding time delay is ai2+s02 /c0, where s0 is the axial distance from the aperture plane and c0 is the sound speed. Kirchhoff theory is used to make the calculation. A formula is derived for the rms pressure of the edge wave in terms of the rms pressure and autocorrelation function of the incident wave. The formula can be evaluated for incident waves that are sinusoidal, random (e.g., noise), or transient. Predictions agree reasonably well with underwater measurements made with a spark-generated pulse incident on various apertures. The main result is that making the edge ragged reduces the rms pressure of the edge wave. Indeed, an edge profile is presented that, for a given frequency and axial observation point, eliminates the edge wave completely.","https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article-pdf/107/1/103/8085795/103_1_online.pdf",""

Pep-1 showed specific binding to soluble, immobilized, and cell-associated forms of HA, and it inhibited leukocyte adhesion to HA substrates almost completely. Systemic, local, or topical administration of Pep-1 inhibited the expression of contact hypersensitivity responses in mice by blocking skin-directed homing of inflammatory leukocytes. Pep-1 also inhibited the sensitization phase by blocking hapten-triggered migration of Langerhans cells from the epidermis.

In the present work, we examined the possible roles of the Sec6/8 complex or the exocyst in polarized Ca2+ signaling in pancreatic acinar cells. Immunolocalization by confocal microscopy showed that the Sec6/8 complex is excluded from tight junctions and secretory granules in these cells. The Sec6/8 complex was found in at least two cellular compartments, part of the complex showed similar, but not identical, localization with the Golgi apparatus and part of the complex associated with Ca2+ signaling proteins next to the plasma membrane at the apical pole. Accordingly, immunoprecipitation (IP) of Sec8 did not coimmunoprecipitate βCOP, Golgi 58K protein, or mannosidase II, all Golgi-resident proteins. By contrast, IP of Sec8 coimmunoprecipitates Sec6, type 3 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3R3), and the Gβγ subunit of G proteins from pancreatic acinar cell extracts. Furthermore, the anti-Sec8 antibodies coimmunoprecipitate actin, Sec6, the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump, the G protein subunits Gαq and Gβγ, the β1 isoform of phospholipase C, and the ER resident IP3R1 from brain microsomal extracts. Antibodies against the various signaling and Ca2+ transport proteins coimmunoprecipitate Sec8 and the other signaling proteins. Dissociation of actin filaments in the immunoprecipitate had no effect on the interaction between Sec6 and Sec8, but released the actin and dissociated the interaction between the Sec6/8 complex and Ca2+ signaling proteins. Hence, the interaction between the Sec6/8 and Ca2+ signaling complexes is likely mediated by the actin cytoskeleton. The anti-Sec6 and anti-Sec8 antibodies inhibited Ca2+ signaling at a step upstream of Ca2+ release by IP3. Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton with latrunculin B in intact cells resulted in partial translocation of Sec6 and Sec8 from membranes to the cytosol and interfered with propagation of agonist-evoked Ca2+ waves. Our results suggest that the Sec6/8 complex has multiple roles in secretory cells including governing the polarized expression of Ca2+ signaling complexes and regulation of their activity.","https://rupress.org/jcb/article-pdf/150/5/1101/1860409/0004119.pdf",""

We have implemented a high speed simulation combining streamline fluid flow and ray-Born seismic modeling to examine feasibility and uncertainty of such monitoring. The simulation is applied to an 80% gas-saturated reservoir model with stochastic models of porosity and permeability. We then apply a rapid streamline fluid simulation. The petrophysical, pore pressure and fluid saturation data provide the basis for predicting time-dependent elastic properties of the reservoir using the Gassmann equation. Bulk moduli for the solid grains and fluid properties were chosen to represent reservoir conditions at a depth of 2 km, and dry rock bulk and shear moduli were chosen with the empirical equation from the laboratory data. Given these parameters from the Gassmann equation, a ray-Born algorithm provides a high speed, 3-D simulation of seismic data. We find that the seismic amplitude change before and after water injection is large enough to be seismically visible in the high porosity regions of the reservoir, but the change in low porosity regions is small and may be masked if the signal-to-noise ratio is small. The pore pressure change is also a critical reservoir property that influences the seismic amplitude. Uncertainty of the dry bulk modulus has less influence in high porosity regions than in low porosity regions.","http://onepetro.org/OTCONF/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.4043/12135-MS/1911376/otc-12135-ms.pdf",""

Phosphatidylserine translocation and caspase 3-like activity confirmed the apoptotic action of palmitate. Cytosolic cytochrome cwas detected at 8 h and plateaued at 12 h. The mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ) in tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester-loaded cardiac myocytes decreased significantly in individual mitochondria by 8 h. This loss was heterogeneous, with a few energized mitochondria per myocyte remaining at 24 h. Total ATP levels remained high at 16 h. The ΔΨ loss was delayed by cyclosporin A, a mitochondrial permeability transition inhibitor. Mitochondrial swelling accompanied changes in ΔΨ. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I activity fell at 16 h; this decline was accompanied by ceramide increases that paralleled decreased complex III activity. We conclude that carnitine palmitoyltransferase I inhibition, ceramide accumulation, and complex III inhibition are downstream events in cardiac apoptosis mediated by palmitate and occur independent of events leading to caspase 3-like activation.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpheart.2000.279.5.H2124",""

However, the post-infectious encephalitis was not demonstrated in mice exposed to 0.5 LD50 of the same virus. The mortality rates of mice infected with 0.5 LD50 of the virus were increased to levels observed in mice exposed to 3.0 LD50 of influenza virus infection, after the administration of a mixture of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10 (2 ng/mouse each; immediately, 1 and 2 days after the infection).

We have examined the expression of pRb-related proteins p130 and p107 as well as the regulation of E2F during spontaneous differentiation of the Caco-2 intestinal cell line. Nuclear protein levels of p130 and p107 were increased with Caco-2 differentiation. Induction of a slower-migrating E2F complex was noted in postconfluent (i.e., differentiated) Caco-2 cells; p130 protein was the predominant component of this E2F complex with a minor contribution from cyclin-dependent kinase-2. A small component of p107 binding was identified by deoxycholate release gel shift assays. In contrast, no pRb binding to E2F was noted in Caco-2 cells. In addition to increased association with p130, E2F-4 phosphorylation was markedly decreased in differentiated Caco-2 cells, whereas E2F protein levels remained unchanged. Taken together, our findings suggest that the regulation of E2F function may be an important contributing factor in the cell cycle block and spontaneous differentiation of Caco-2 cells.

We determined the effects of cell growth on eNOS expression in cultured ovine fetal PAEC studied at varying levels of confluence. NOS enzymatic activity was sixfold greater in quiescent PAEC at 100% confluence compared with more rapidly replicating cells at 50% confluence. To determine if there is a reciprocal effect of NO on PAEC growth, studies of NOS inhibition or the provision of exogenous NO from spermine NONOate were performed. Neither intervention had a discernable effect on PAEC growth. The influence of cell growth on NOS activity was unique to pulmonary endothelium, because varying confluence did not alter NOS activity in fetal systemic endothelial cells. The effects of cell growth induced by serum stimulation were also evaluated, and NOS enzymatic activity was threefold greater in quiescent, serum-deprived cells compared with that in serum-stimulated cells. The increase in NOS activity observed at full confluence was accompanied by parallel increases in eNOS protein and mRNA expression. These findings indicate that eNOS gene expression in fetal PAEC is upregulated during cell quiescence and downregulated during rapid cell growth. Furthermore, the interaction between cell growth and NO in the PAEC is unidirectional.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajplung.2000.278.1.L131",""

However, past evaluation studies have all used male participants exclusively. Consequently, the present study investigated the generalizability of the effectiveness and efficiency gains to women. We randomly assigned 108 female participants to either the AlM-dyad condition or a standard individual control training condition. The results supported the robustness and viability of the AIM protocol. Although their overall performance was lower than that obtained for men in previous studies, women trained in the AIM-dyad condition performed as well as those trained in the individual condition. Thus, the efficiency gains associated with the AIMdyad protocol, which result from the ability to train two people simultaneously to reach the same performance level as a single person with no increase in training time or machine cost, are generalizable to female participants. The applied and basic research implications of the present study are discussed within the context of well-documented male/female differences in the performance of complex psychomotor tasks. For instance, given the number of women entering the workforce and the significant proportion of women in professions previously deemed to be male-dominated (e.g., air navigation), it is reassuring to know that sex differences in task performance do not necessarily imply sex differences in the effectiveness of training protocols.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1518/001872000779698169",""

We speculated that lung injury might be mediated by p53, a proapoptotic transcription factor widely implicated in the response of cells to DNA damage. Intratracheal administration of bleomycin led to caspase-mediated DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis. The effects of bleomycin were associated with translocation of p53 from the cytosol to the nucleus only in alveolar macrophages that had been exposed to the drug in vivo, suggesting that the lung microenvironment regulated p53 activation. Experiments with a thiol antioxidant (N-acetylcysteine) in vivo and nitric oxide (NO) donors in vitro confirmed that reactive oxygen species were required for p53 activation. A specific role for NO was demonstrated in experiments with inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)−/− macrophages, which failed to demonstrate nuclear p53 localization after in vivo bleomycin exposure. Strikingly, rates of bleomycin-induced apoptosis were at least twofold higher in p53−/− C57BL/6 mice compared with heterozygous or wild-type littermates. Similarly, levels of apoptosis were also twofold higher in the lungs of iNOS−/− mice than were observed in wild-type controls. Consistent with a role for apoptosis in chronic lung injury, levels of bleomycin-induced inflammation were substantially higher in iNOS−/− and p53−/− mice compared with wild-type controls. Together, our results demonstrate that iNOS and p53 mediate a novel apoptosis-suppressing pathway in the lung.","https://rupress.org/jem/article-pdf/192/6/857/1700540/000302.pdf",""

Conventional belief is that the higher the implantation energy, the deeper the recoil profile. While this is true for low-energy incident ions, we show here that the situation is reversed for incident Si ions of higher energy due to the fact that recoil probability at a given angle is a strong function of the energy of the primary projectile. Our experiments show that 500 keV high-energy recoil implantation produces a shallower B profile than lower-energy implantation such as 10 and 50 keV.

These resonance networks pervade the IR spectrum of tropolone above 500 cm−1, and the absorbances are much more strongly perturbed from harmonic level predictions than the frequencies. Some of the IR absorbances are also sensitive to intermolecular interactions.

Treatment with fluvoxamine and fluoxetine (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) reversibly alleviated complaints. Testing while medicated and unmedicated (after voluntary withdrawal from medication for several weeks) revealed no difference in pure-tone thresholds, speech thresholds, word recognition scores, tympanograms, or acoustic reflex thresholds. Medicated SCAN ● A (a screening test for central auditory processing disorders) results were normal, and unmedicated results were abnormal. Unmedicated transient otoacoustic emissions and auditory brainstem response waves I, III, and V were significantly larger bilaterally. Uncomfortable loudness levels indicated greater tolerance during the medicated condition. Central processing and vigilance were evaluated with analog-synthesized three-formant consonant-vowel syllables. While medicated, responses to stimuli at each ear revealed well-defined, labeling crossovers of about 90 msec. Vowel identification matched normal subject responses; labeling of /gE/jE/ and /bE/wE/ continua was well defined but all crossover points differed from normals (p < .0001).

A Finapres device measured finger arterial pressure. No difference in baroreflex function, heart rate variability, or LBNP tolerance was observed with sleep restriction ( P > 0.3). Systolic pressure was greater at −60 mmHg LBNP after sleep restriction than before sleep restriction (110 ± 6 and 124 ± 3 mmHg before and after sleep restriction, respectively, P = 0.038), whereas heart rate decreased (108 ± 8 and 99 ± 8 beats/min before and after sleep restriction, respectively, P = 0.028).

All have the property of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerization, and most have been implicated in folding and trafficking events. In an earlier study, we identified that FKBP65 associates with the extracellular matrix protein tropoelastin during its transport through the cell. In the present study, we have carried out a detailed investigation of the subcellular localization of FKBP65 and its relationship to tropoelastin. Using subcellular fractionation, Triton X-114 phase separation, protease protection assays, and immunofluorescence microscopy (IF), we have identified that FKBP65 is contained within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Subsequent IF studies colocalized FKBP65 with tropoelastin and showed that the two proteins dissociate before reaching the Golgi apparatus. Immunohistochemical localization of FKBP65 in developing lung showed strong staining of vascular and airway smooth muscle cells. Similar areas stained positive for the presence of elastic fibers in the extracellular matrix. The expression of FKBP65 was investigated during development as tropoelastin is not expressed in adult tissues. Tissue-specific expression of FKBP65 was observed in 12-d old mouse tissues; however, the pattern of expression of FKBP65 was not restricted to those tissues expressing tropoelastin. This suggests that additional ligands for FKBP65 likely exist within the ER. Remarkably, in the adult tissues examined, FKBP65 expression was absent or barely detectable. Taken together, these results support an ER-localized FKBP65-tropoelastin interaction that occurs specifically during growth and development of tissues.","",""

In 5755 appendectomies, our overall rate of complicated appendicitis was 32 per cent; higher in males, in the young, and in the elderly; and relatively stable over each year reviewed. Prospectively, we determined that of the various time intervals, the time from the onset of symptoms to first seeking medical attention is the only significant predictor of complicated appendicitis (39.8 vs 16.5 hours for acute appendicitis). On the other hand, the time from surgical evaluation to operative intervention was significantly shorter for complicated appendicitis (3.8 vs 4.7 hours for acute appendicitis). The high rate of complicated appendicitis with its subsequent sequelae of increased morbidity and resource expenditure is primarily the direct result of patient delay in seeking medical attention and not the result of diagnostic dilemma or surgical delay.

In this article, we make one such comparison between a newly introduced technique of scanning capacitance spectroscopy and a somewhat older technique of selective etching. Based on vastly different principles, these two techniques provide an opportunity to learn about each through comparison. The results of the comparisons are shown to be consistent both in the qualitative shape similarities of the n-type metal-oxide semiconductor (NMOS) data from both methods and in the quantitative agreement of the lateral junction position under the gate to within 30 nm. The p-type metal-oxide semiconductor (PMOS) data from both techniques differ somewhat in the channel region due to the fact that under these etching conditions the channel region tends to etch out and at long times can etch out to a point comparable to the true junction. The vertical alignment with SIMS and thus with the etching data is within the 30 nm error margin. The general comparison between the two techniques indicates that the junction is determined at the same point in the lateral direction for the NMOS device, and there is some disagreement on the PMOS junction position under these conditions.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-pdf/18/1/566/11294136/566_1_online.pdf",""

The method of gradient corrected density functionals (NLDFT) in conjunction with moderate basis sets was found to yield satisfactory molecular geometries and vibrational frequencies. Single-point energy calculations were performed using various methods, including MP2, MP4, and CCSD(T). The most energetically favorable isomers are those with OH addition to the terminal carbon positions. At the CCSD(T)/6-311G** level of theory corrected with zero-point energy (ZPE), the isomers with OH additions to isoprene at C1 to C4 positions (i.e., isomers I–IV) are 34.8, 24.2, 22.4, and 32.3 kcal mol−1 more stable than the OH and isoprene, respectively.

We tested the hypothesis that the CC chemokine receptor (CCR)2 and CCR5 and the chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, a ligand for CCR5, influence DC migration and localization. We found that deficiency of CCR2 but not CCR5 or MIP-1α led to distinct defects in DC biology. Langerhans cell (skin DC) density in CCR2-null mice was normal, and their ability to migrate into the dermis was intact; however, their migration to the draining lymph nodes was markedly impaired. CCR2-null mice had lower numbers of DCs in the spleen, and this was primarily due to a reduction in the CD8α1 T helper cell type 1 (Th1)-inducing subset of DCs. Additionally, there was a block in the Leishmania major infection–induced relocalization of splenic DCs from the marginal zone to the T cell areas. We propose that these DC defects, in conjunction with increased expression of B lymphocyte chemoattractant, a B cell–specific chemokine, may collectively contribute to the striking B cell outgrowth and Th2 cytokine–biased nonhealing phenotype that we observed in CCR2-deficient mice infected with L. major. This disease phenotype in mice with an L. major–resistant genetic background but lacking CCR2 is strikingly reminiscent of that observed typically in mice with an L. major–susceptible genetic background. Thus, CCR2 is an important determinant of not only DC migration and localization but also the development of protective cell-mediated immune responses to L. major.","https://rupress.org/jem/article-pdf/192/2/205/1700445/991793.pdf",""

The effect of molecular structure on dielectric anisotropy has been investigated for two low dielectric-constant polymers: a fluorinated polyimide, FPI-136M and a fluorinated poly(aryl ether), FLARE-1.51. Optical and electrical measurements have been carried out to determine the dielectric anisotropy in blanket thin films and trench line structures. Results from optical measurements show that the FPI-136M film has a larger birefringence than the FLARE-1.51 film, indicating a larger dielectric anisotropy. This reflects a higher degree of in-plane molecular orientation for the rigid rod-like fluorinated polyimide, while the fluorinated poly(aryl ether) has an ether linkage that allows greater chain flexibility. Electrical measurement of the dielectric anisotropy has been performed using a metal–insulator–metal structure to determine the out-of-plane dielectric constant and an interdigitated submicron metal line structure coupled with a two-dimension computer model to determine the in-plane dielectric constant. Results show that the rigid rod-like FPI-136M has a smaller dielectric anisotropy compared with that measured from the optical birefringence. In contrast, the dielectric anisotropy of the more flexible FLARE-1.51 is found to be similar to that obtained from the optical birefringence measurement. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has been used to examine the molecular structures in the blanket films and the trench line structures. The FTIR spectra of FPI-136M show that its molecular structure in submicron trenches is significantly different to that in spin-coated blanket film. This is in contrast to FLARE-1.51, which has similar molecular orientation for the blanket film and the trench structure. Thus, the molecular orientation of the rigid rod-like FPI-136M seems to be more affected by the confinement in submicron trenches, giving rise to a lesser degree of dielectric anisotropy than that observed in blanket films.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-pdf/18/1/208/11293961/208_1_online.pdf",""

The gene encoding human 11β-hydroxylase (hCYP11B1) is expressed in the adrenal cortex under the control of circulating levels of ACTH. The current study was undertaken to define the cis-regulatory elements and transacting factors that regulate hCYP11B1 transcription. The hCYP11B1 5′-flanking DNA was studied using transient transfection of luciferase reporter constructs in NCI-H295R human adrenocortical cells. A cAMP analogue ((Bu)2cAMP) increased expression of a construct containing −1102 bp of hCYP11B1 5′-flanking DNA (pB1–1102). An element at position −71/−64 (TGACGTGA, previously termed Ad1) resembling a consensus cAMP response element (CRE) was required for maximal induction by cAMP. The Ad1 element bound several transcriptional factors in electrophoretic mobility shift assays, including CRE-binding protein, activating transcription factor-1 (ATF-1), and ATF-2, but only the ATF-2 complex migrated similarly to a complex seen using H295R nuclear extract. In addition, Western analysis of H295R and adrenal lysates demonstrated expression of high levels of ATF-2 and ATF-1. CRE-binding protein levels varied among the strains of H295R cells tested. Transcription of CYP11B1 also appeared to be regulated by steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1). Luciferase reporter gene activity was increased after cotransfection with expression vectors containing SF-1. An element in hCYP11B1 at positions −242/−234 (CCAAGGCTC), previously termed Ad4, was required for maximal induction by SF-1 and was found to bind SF-1 in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The key role for SF-1 in hCYP11B1 transcription is in contrast to its lack of an effect on expression of the hCYP11B2 (aldosterone synthase) isozyme. The differential effects of SF-1 on transcription of hCYP11B1 and hCYP11B2 may be one of the mechanisms controlling differential expression of these isozymes within the zonae fasciculata and glomerulosa of the human adrenal cortex.","http://academic.oup.com/endo/article-pdf/141/10/3587/10352419/endo3587.pdf",""

The process of seeking a transplant for a child is very stressful, and before interventions can be developed, clinicians need to understand how aspects of family life are affected. Twenty-nine mothers whose children were being evaluated for a liver transplant constituted the sample for this exploratory study. Higher family strains, fewer coping skills, and higher perception of stress were related to more unhealthy family adaptation during the pretransplant phase. Data point to the need for close evaluation not only for the child's needs but for the family's needs as the family begins the process of seeking a transplant for the child.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/152692480001000203",""

The trapping-mediated chemisorption mechanism is shown to be the dominant adsorption pathway under the conditions investigated. The first step in such a mechanism, namely trapping into the physical adsorption well, has been studied directly via measurements at a surface temperature of 77 K. As expected, the trapping probability drops with increasing kinetic energy, but nearly 50% of incident molecules trap at 1 eV incident energy, indicating that trapping is quite efficient over a wide range of translational energies. Chemisorption probability values measured at higher surface temperatures are fit to a simple trapping-mediated chemisorption model that can be used to predict adsorption probabilities over a wide range of conditions. Measurements of the chemisorption probability at 500 K are independent of incident angle at kinetic energies of 0.75 eV and below. However, trapping probabilities measured at 77 K are shown to decrease with increasing angle of incidence at kinetic energies of 0.6 eV and above. This unusual effect is discussed in terms of molecular scattering during parallel momentum accommodation. In order to investigate the effect of surface hydrogen formed as a result of disilane decomposition, adsorption probabilities were measured as a function of monohydride coverage as well. On a monohydride-saturated surface the trapping probability is found to be lower than on a bare surface, most likely due to a decreased disilane physical adsorption binding energy compared to the bare surface. Also, the trapping probability varies linearly with hydrogen coverage between bare-surface and monohydride-saturated values. On the other hand, the hydrogen coverage dependence of the chemisorption probability is found to follow a simple second-order kinetic scheme based on chemisorption occurring at two vacant surface sites.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/113/6/2470/19174866/2470_1_online.pdf",""

This study was designed to determine whether the calcium channel blocker verapamil affects cholesteatoma migration in vitro. METHODS: Cholesteatoma cells harvested from patients with chronic ear disease were grown in culture and were exposed to culture medium containing verapamil. The migration rate of the verapamil‐exposed cells was compared with control rates. RESULTS: Verapamil at 300 μg/L caused marked reduction in the rate of migration compared with control values. The migration rate returned to normal within 48 hours after verapamil was removed from the culture medium. Higher verapamil concentrations (500 μg/L) caused complete detachment of the epithelial cells from the substrate within 24 hours. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that cholesteatoma migration in vitro is calcium channel dependent and can be reduced with calcium channel blockers such as verapamil.

Their distribution ratios were 1:2:2, respectively. Many cells responsive to translational motion exhibited spatiotemporal characteristics with both response gain and phase varying as a function of the stimulus vector angle. Rotationally sensitive neurons were distributed as Type I, II, or III responses (sensitive to ipsilateral, contralateral, or both directions, respectively) in the ratios of 4:6:1. Four tested factors shaped the response dynamics of the sampled neurons: canal-otolith convergence, oculomotor-related activity, rotational Type (I or II), and the phase of the maximum response. Type I nonconvergent cells displayed increasing gains with increasing rotational stimulus frequency (0.1–2.0 Hz, 60°/s), whereas Type II neurons with convergent inputs had response gains that markedly decreased with increasing translational stimulus frequency (0.25–2.0 Hz, ±0.1 g). Type I convergent and Type II nonconvergent neurons exhibited essentially flat gains across the stimulus frequency range. Oculomotor-related activity was noted in 30% of the cells across all functional types, appearing as burst/pause discharge patterns related to the fast phase of nystagmus during head rotation. Oculomotor-related activity was correlated with enhanced dynamic range compared with the same category that had no oculomotor-related response. Finally, responses that were in-phase with head velocity during rotation exhibited greater gains with stimulus frequency increments than neurons with out-of-phase responses. In contrast, for translational motion, neurons out of phase with head acceleration exhibited low-pass characteristics, whereas in-phase neurons did not. Data from decerebrate preparations revealed that although similar response types could be detected, the sampled cells generally had lower background discharge rates, on average one-third lower response gains, and convergent properties that differed from those found in the alert animals. On the basis of the dynamic response of identified cell types, we propose a pair of models in which inhibitory input from vestibular-related neurons converges on oculomotor neurons with excitatory inputs from the vestibular nuclei. Simple signal convergence and combinations of different types of vestibular labyrinth information can enrich the dynamic characteristics of the rotational and translational vestibuloocular responses.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jn.2000.83.4.1958",""

Examples are provided in which this validation identified subtle errors, either in the dose model or in the implementation of the dose algorithm. These errors would not have been detected if the commissioning process only compared relative dose distributions. A set of beam configurations, with varying field sizes, source‐to‐skin distances, wedges, and blocking, were established to validate monitor unit calculations for two different beam models in two different radiation treatment planning systems. Monitor units calculated using the treatment planning systems were compared with monitor units calculated from point dose calculations from tissue‐maximum ratio (TMR) tables. When discrepancies occurred, the dose models and the code were analyzed to identify the causes of the discrepancies. Discrepancies in monitor unit calculations were both significant (up to 5%) and systematic. Analysis of the dose computation software found: (1) a coordinate system transformation error, (2) mishandling of dose‐spread arrays, (3) differences between dose calculations in the commissioning software and the planning software, and (4) shortcomings in modeling of head scatter. Corrections were made in the beam calculation software or in the data sets to overcome these discrepancies. Consequently, we recommend incorporating validation of monitor unit calculations as part of a photon beam commissioning process.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1120%2Fjacmp.v1i3.2640",""

To better understand the role of estrogen in skeletal metabolism and growth, we have assessed long bone growth and histomorphometry in aromatase-deficient (ArKO) mice. The age range for the animals was 5–7 months. At this age mice have already achieved peak bone density but continue slow bone growth. Femur length, an index of long bone growth, showed decreased growth in ArKO males compared with wild-type (wt) littermates but no significant difference in females. Radiographically, compared with age- and sex- matched littermates both ArKO males and females showed osteopenia in the lumbar spine. Histologically, both ArKO males and females showed an osteoporotic-type picture, characterized by significant decreases in trabecular bone volume and trabecular thickness. However, compared with wt littermates female ArKO animals showed a bone remodeling picture consistent with increased bone turnover, much like early postmenopausal osteoporosis in humans. On the other hand, male ArKO animals showed decreases in both osteoblastic and osteoclastic surfaces compared with wt littermates, similar to age-related osteopenia. These findings suggest that osteoporosis seen in aromatase-deficient mice may arise from different bone remodeling activities between males and females. These results also show that the ArKO model exhibits the expected results of estrogen deficiency and may be a good model for investigating sex-specific responses to estrogen deficiency. Furthermore, they imply that estrogen is important for attaining peak bone mass in male as well as in female mice.","https://academic.oup.com/jbmr/article-pdf/15/3/507/56602884/5650150314.pdf",""

Geotechnical stratigraphy and high-resolution seismic stratigraphy form a method by which the geotechnical nature of the sediments that cover a large area can be efficiently assessed. In 1998 fifty jumbo piston cores up to 20 meters in length were collected on a traverse from the upper to the lower continental slope in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico. Detailed geotechnical properties, bulk density, water content, porosity were determined at 4cm intervals with a GEOTEK core logger. Shear strength and magnetic susceptibility were also determined at 4cm intervals. High-resolution seismic profiles (3.5 kHz) were obtained across the continental slope by the use of TAMU Deep Tow System. The long piston cores were taken along the seismic tracks. Bulk density profiles of the cores showed a remarkable and very detailed similarity between cores that cover a range over a distance of 160 km, from the upper continental slope to the lower continental slope. Markers such as an ash layer dated as being 29,800 years old was found in the majority of cores recovered as was increasing and decreasing amounts of forams that results in a distinct bulk density profile that is traceable across the slope. As expected, on basin walls and floors, slump and debris flow deposits break the common geotechnical property profile. The majority of sediments recovered were highly bioturbated hemipelagic silty clays with varying amounts of forams and highly laminated unbioturbated silt, clayey silt and silty clay that contained no forams. The results of this study suggests that geotechnical properties of surficial continental slope sediments can be traced between core sites with a high degree of reliability by the use of high-resolution seismic data coupled with strategically placed large-diameter piston cores.","http://onepetro.org/OTCONF/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.4043/12104-MS/1911506/otc-12104-ms.pdf",""

A simple analytic solution to the density matrix equation is obtained for two-level atoms. The electron-induced transition of a hydrogen-like ion in dense hydrogen plasma is studied as an example. It is demonstrated that, when the plasma density is sufficiently high, low-frequency ion-density fluctuations influence the electron dynamics and thereby cause coherent excitation between close-lying atomic states.

To examine differences in compensating top executives, we estimate a system of simultaneous equations that is designed to accommodate interconnections between performance, the level of compensation, and the mix of compensation components. We document that the shares of both bonus and option pay increase with performance and that the pay level and the extent of incentive pay positively affect firm performance. We identify economic factors that may influence the use of options and show that there are significant differences in these factors between IT and other industries.

To better understand the manner in which TRiC interacts with newly translated polypeptides, we examined its association with nascent chains using a photo-cross-linking approach. To this end, a series of ribosome-bound nascent chains of defined lengths was prepared using truncated mRNAs. Photoactivatable probes were incorporated into these 35S- labeled nascent chains during translation. Upon photolysis, TRiC was cross-linked to ribosome-bound polypeptides exposing at least 50–90 amino acids outside the ribosomal exit channel, indicating that the chaperonin associates with much shorter nascent chains than indicated by previous studies. Cross-links were observed for nascent chains of the cytosolic proteins actin, luciferase, and enolase, but not to ribosome-bound preprolactin. The pattern of cross-links became more complex as the nascent chain increased in length. These results suggest a chain length–dependent increase in the number of TRiC subunits involved in the interaction that is consistent with the idea that the substrate participates in subunit-specific contacts with the chaperonin. Both ribosome isolation by centrifugation through sucrose cushions and immunoprecipitation with anti-puromycin antibodies demonstrated that the photoadducts form on ribosome-bound polypeptides. Our results indicate that TRiC/CCT associates with the translating polypeptide shortly after it emerges from the ribosome and suggest a close association between the chaperonin and the translational apparatus.","https://rupress.org/jcb/article-pdf/149/3/591/1859117/0001001.pdf",""

This novel system is the first of its kind and integrates a completely noninvasive optical probe to measure glucose concentrations within cell culture media, in situ. Spectra recorded from a four-day fibroblast culture with this fiber coupled system and an FT-IR spectrometer have been analyzed and compared with standard clinical chemistry techniques. Partial least-squares (PLS) regression has been used to extract the analyte-dependent information and to build a successful multivariate calibration model. A combination of spectra from cell culture media and prepared media mixtures was used to eliminate unwanted correlations in the calibration data. The combined use of this unique fiberoptic system, PLS, and uncorrelated spectra resulted in a true glucose prediction error of 14.8 mg/dL in an independent validation set.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1366/0003702001948592",""

This approach to generating high aspect ratio, high resolution images held great promise particularly for 193 nm and EUV lithography applications. Several 193 nm top surface imaging (TSI) systems have been described that produce very high resolution (low k factor) images with wide process latitude. However, because of the line edge roughness associated with the final images, TSI systems have fallen from favor. In fact, TSI does not appear in the strategy or plan for any imaging technology at this time. Most of the 193 nm TSI systems that have been studied are based on poly(p-hydroxystyrene) resins. These polymers have an unfortunate combination of properties that limit their utility in this application. These limiting properties include (1) high optical density, (2) poor silylation contrast, and (3) low glass transition temperature of the silylated material. These shortcomings are related to inherent polymer characteristics and are responsible for the pronounced line edge roughness in the poly(p-hydroxystyrene) systems. We have synthesized certain alicyclic polymers that have higher transparency and higher glass transition temperatures. Using these polymers, we have demonstrated the ability to print high resolution features with very smooth sidewalls. This article describes the synthesis and characterization of the polymers, their application to top surface imaging at 193 nm, and the analysis that was used to tailor the processing and the polymer’s physical properties to achieve optimum imaging.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-pdf/18/5/2551/8203373/2551_1_online.pdf",""

This suggests the reduction of B diffusion. If another B occupies that position (X=B), then a smaller migration energy is observed and enhanced diffusion is expected. The simulation results are consistent with experiments. The reason for the migration energy difference can be understood in terms of electronic and strain effects. Estimates of the enthalpy of bond formation agree with the simulation except for the low-enthalpy cases where the strain effect caused by atom-size misfit dominates.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article-pdf/77/17/2683/18553127/2683_1_online.pdf",""

We describe a novel muscle-specific RING-finger protein (MURF) expressed specifically in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells throughout pre- and postnatal mouse development. MURF belongs to the RING-B-box-coiled-coil subclass of RING-finger proteins, characterized by an NH2-terminal RING-finger followed by a zinc-finger domain (B-box) and a leucine-rich coiled-coil domain. Expression of MURF is required for skeletal myoblast differentiation and myotube fusion. The leucine-rich coiled-coil domain of MURF mediates association with microtubules, whereas the RING-finger domain is required for microtubule stabilization and an additional region is required for homo-oligomerization. Expression of MURF establishes a cellular microtubule network that is resistant to microtubule depolymerization induced by alkaloids, cold and calcium. These results identify MURF as a myogenic regulator of the microtubule network of striated muscle cells and reveal a link between microtubule organization and myogenesis.","https://rupress.org/jcb/article-pdf/150/4/771/1860540/9912078.pdf",""

The medical records of 77 patients who underwent elective repair of a midline incisional hernia at the Dallas Veterans Affairs Medical Center between 1991 and 1995 were reviewed. Demographic data, presence of chronic illnesses, type of repair, and presence of recurrence were noted. Ninety‐six percent of the patients were men, with an average age of 59 years. More than 50% of the patients had chronic lung or cardiac diseases and more than 40% weighed ≥120% of their ideal body weight and had a body mass index (BMI) ≥30. Sixty‐two percent of the patients underwent primary reapproximation of the fascia (tissue repair), whereas 38% underwent repair with prosthetic material (prosthetic repair). The overall recurrence rate was 45%, with a median follow‐up of 45 months (range 6–73). Seventy‐four percent of the recurrences presented within 3 years of repair. The recurrence rate for those patients undergoing a tissue repair was 54%, whereas the recurrence rate following prosthetic repair was 29%. The incidence of recurrence for patients with pulmonary or cardiac disease or diabetes mellitus was similar to that of patients without these illnesses. The percent ideal body weight and BMI of patients who developed a recurrent hernia, particularly following a prosthetic repair, were significantly greater than those of patients whose repairs remained intact. These data strongly support the use of prosthetic repairs for incisional hernias, particularly in patients who are overweight.","http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s002689910018.pdf",""

A dose-dependent increase in the secretion of IFN by both Mφ and L929 cells incubated with cocaine, with a concomitant decrease in virus replication, is also reported. The increase in IFN secretion was most pronounced when cells were cultured in the presence of the IFN inducer poly(I·C). The effect of cocaine on IFN production was found to be primarily at the transcript level in both Mφ and L929 cells.

The annular cavity between the labyrinth seal teeth is subdivided into separate annular cavities around the circumference of the rotor by partitioning walls. Also, the upstream and downstream teeth have different radial clearances to the rotor. These seals have been shown to provide a remarkable amount of direct damping to attenuate vibration in turbomachinery, but they generally leak more than conventional labyrinth seals if both seals have the same minimum clearance. Conversely, brush seals allow less than half the leakage of labyrinth seals, but published test results show no significant amount of damping. They are considered to be a primary choice for the seals in new aircraft engine designs because of their low leakage. This paper will describe a recently invented hybrid brush/pocket damper seal that combines high damping with low leakage. Previous brush seal results were studied and calculations were made to select a brush seal to combine with the pocket damper design. The result is a hybrid seal with high damping and low leakage. A special design feature can also allow active vibration control as a bonus benefit. A computer code written for the original pocket damper seal was modified to include the brush element at the exit blade. Results from the computer code indicate that the hybrid seal can have less leakage than a six bladed (or 6 knives) labyrinth seal along with orders of magnitude more damping. Experimental evaluations of the damping and leakage performance of the hybrid seal are being conducted by the authors. The experimental work reported here tested the damping capability of the new hybrid brush seal by exciting the seal journal through an impedance head. A conventional six-bladed labyrinth seal of the same working dimensions was also tested. The brush hybrid pocket damper seal is found to leak less than the labyrinth seal while producing two to three times more damping than the original pocket damper seal (orders of magnitude more than the conventional labyrinth).

How the TRANSIMS low-fidelity highway simulation module compares with a high-fidelity model and with empirical observations from intelligent transportation system (ITS) implementation projects has been examined. A section of Interstate 10 in Houston, Texas, was used as a test bed and ITS data were obtained for calibration and validation purposes. For comparison, the high-fidelity CORSIM model, which is used extensively in North America for operational analyses, was calibrated and tested with the same data. The two models did equally well at replicating the baseline volume data. In addition, the mean travel time output from the calibrated TRANSIMS model tended to be about 20 percent greater than the mean travel time from the calibrated CORSIM model. In general, the observed travel times were found to lie between the simulated values from the TRANSIMS and CORSIM models. More important, the link and corridor travel time variability appeared to be significantly less than the observed travel time variability. It is hypothesized that this difference may affect certain measures of effectiveness, such as automobile emissions, that will be used by transportation planners.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/1739-01",""

Continued host switching consistently exhibited this pattern. Growth inhibition on Escherichia resulted from two to three substitutions in the major capsid gene. When these phages were forced to grow again on Escherichia, fitness recovery occurred predominantly by reversions at these same sites, rather than by second-site compensatory changes, the more frequently observed mechanism in most microbial systems. The affected residues lie on the virion surface and they alter attachment efficiency, yet they occur in a region distinct from a putative binding region previously identified from X-ray crystallography. These residues not only experienced high rates of evolution in our experiments, but also exhibited high levels of radical amino acid variation among ϕX174 and its known relatives, consistent with a history of adaptation involving these sites.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/154/1/27/42027780/genetics0027.pdf",""

Since armadillos give birth to only monozygous quadruplets, the genetic variation within litters is essentially zero. Quadruplets born in captivity were isolated a.nd weighed within 8 h of birth. Oxygen consumption was measured in resting neonates by flow-through respirometry, heart rate obtained from an electrocardiogram and ventilation was measured by impedance techniques. Following the measurements, neonates were returned to the mother. Measurements were repeated at 4 and 8 days after birth. Mean heart rate significantly increased from 132 beats min−1 on the day of birth to 169 beats min−1 on day 8. Mean ventilation rate significantly decreased from 81 breaths min−1 on the day of birth to 54 breaths min−1 on day 8. During this same developmental period, mean mass significantly increased from 100 g to 129 g, and mean mass-specific oxygen consumption significantly decreased from ml O2 kg−1 min−1 to 28.6 ml O2 kg−1 min−1. For all variables measured, within-litter variability was always significantly less than between-litter variability, confirming a ‘sibling effect’ that we attribute to the genetic components determining physiological characters.","https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article-pdf/203/11/1733/3422631/jexbio_203_11_1733.pdf",""

This may lead to suboptimal blood lipid fatty acid profiles and to a measurable diminution of visual function in developing term infants. The need for docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonic acid supplementation in the infant diet was evaluated in a double‐blind, randomized clinical trial. Methods: Healthy term infants were randomized to diets of (1) commercial formula, (2) docosahexaenoic acid–enriched formula (0.35% of total fatty acids), or (3) docosahexaenoic acid– (0.36%) and arachidonic acid– (0.72%) enriched formula. Eighty‐seven infants completed the 17‐week nutritional trial, and 58 were observed until 52 weeks of life. A reference group was exclusively breast fed for at least 17 weeks ( Results: Commercial formula‐fed infants had 30% to 50% lower content of docosahexaenoic acid in total red blood cell lipids during the 17‐week feeding trial compared with breast‐fed infants. Significant differences persisted at the 1‐year follow‐up. Arachidonic acid content was consistently reduced in the commercial formula group by 15% to 20%. Infants fed long‐chain polyunsaturated fatty acid–enriched formulas had docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonic acid blood lipid profiles resembling those of human milk‐fed infants. Infants receiving this enriched formula had more mature electroretinographic responses than commercial formula‐fed infants at 6 weeks of age. Human milk‐fed and docosahexaenoic acid‐enriched formula‐fed infants had better visual acuity than commercial formula‐fed infants at both 17 and 52 weeks of age. Early (17‐week) fatty acid profiles in blood lipids were correlated with later (52‐week) visual function development in study infants. Conclusions: Results from this clinical trial demonstrate that long‐chain polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation of formula in term infants produces blood lipid fatty acid profiles that are similar to those observed in breast‐fed infants. This supplementation leads to better visual function later in life (i.e., 1 year of age) than that shown by infants fed commercial formula.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/j.1536-4801.2000.tb07178.x",""

Although the chemical reactions between the titanium nitride and the three dielectrics under both growth conditions depend on the type of dielectric used, a few general observations were seen. In comparison with the reactively grown samples, all of the ion-assisted growths show a significant increase in the amount of nitride in the titanium nitride layer at and near the titanium nitride/dielectric interface. Moreover, the amount of chemical binding between the titanium nitride and dielectric is increased when low-energy ions are used.

Extension of her theory led to the hypothesis that men's affection and caring behavior mediates the effects of their abuse on women's evaluative relational judgments (relational well-being, satisfaction, happiness, and commitment). Using an abused subsample from a larger study of low-income, ethnically diverse women, we tested whether men's positivity (caring behavior, relational satisfaction, and happiness) moderates their abuse (threats and acts of violence and sexual aggression) as suggested by Lloyd (1996) or functions as a mediator. The results of structural equation modeling with 717 African-American, Euro-American, and Mexican-American women indicated that Men's Positivity did not moderate the effects of Men's Abuse on Relational Quality. Partial and complete mediation provided similar fits, with the full mediation model accepted as the most parsimonious. This held for women who had sustained severe, potentially life-threatening violence. Neither ethnicity nor relational type (dating, cohabiting, married) functioned as moderators. Thus, when women are abused they apparently give more weight to their perceptions of the positive aspects of their partner when evaluating the quality of their relationship. Limitations of the study as well as implications for therapy and future research are discussed.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0265407500174010",""

Sensors are commonly installed on the helmet to provide information about where the operator is looking. If the operator rotates the helmet, the virtual scene should rotate correspondingly. If the point of rotation (POR) of the operator’s head differs from the POR used to transform the image, the display may behave in bizarre ways. In “enhanced reality” and similar applications the virtual scene must also accurately correspond to the real world. When the virtual scene must accurately correspond to a real scene, it becomes necessary to accurately match the virtual display to the real world. A method for automatically collecting data to align these scenes is described and demonstrated in this paper. A theoretical basis for the method and experimental data are presented.

In humans, high doses or frequent applications of NG (i.e., for angina) lead to rapid loss of its efficacy in relieving angina. To examine whether there is a similar effect on the loss of efficacy of NG on bone, we examined the frequency-dependent effects of NG on bone mineral density (BMD), bone mass, trabecular bone volumes (BV/TV), and blood pressure in rats. Thirty 7-month-old female Brown Norway rats underwent ovariectomy, and an additional six rats were sham-operated. The ovariectomized rats were treated either with vehicle (ovariectomized control), 17β-estradiol (E2; positive control), or 0.2 mg NG (via dermal application) once, twice, or three times a day. Before and at the end of the 10-week treatment period, BMD of the lumbar spine was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometric (DXA) scanning and expressed as a percentage change. BMD in ovariectomized rats was significantly lower (−2.5 ± 2.0%) compared with the sham-operated rats (+6.3 ± 5.3%; p &lt; 0.01). Estrogen therapy completely abolished the ovariectomy-induced potential bone loss (+5.9 ± 3.4%). Application of NG once daily also completely prevented (+6.2 ± 2.8%; p &lt; 0.01) the ovariectomy-induced bone loss (i.e., it was as effective as estrogen). However, the beneficial effects of NG on BMD were significantly reduced with increased frequency of application of NG (+1.9 ± 2.1%, twice a day and −0.2 ± 3.3% three times a day). Estrogen or once daily administration of NG preserved femur weights, BV/TV, and decreased urinary deoxypyridinoline levels as expected. However, a higher level of serum osteocalcin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase levels were maintained only with once daily administration of NG. There were no adverse effects of these doses of NG on blood pressure, but a tendency to lower blood pressure was noticed with increased frequency of NG. These results confirmed our previous findings that NO donors counteract the bone loss associated with estrogen deficiency. However, these beneficial effects of maintaining BMD are lost with increased frequency of NG application.","https://academic.oup.com/jbmr/article-pdf/15/6/1119/56602692/5650150614.pdf",""

Previous studies have demonstrated that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in the presence of serum is a potential mitogen for adult type II cells (R. J. Panos, J. S. Rubin, S. A. Aaronson, and R. J. Mason. J. Clin. Invest. 92: 969–977, 1993) and that it is produced by fetal mesenchymal lung cells (J. S. Rubin, A. M.-L. Chan, D. P. Botarro, W. H. Burgess, W. G. Taylor, A. C. Cech, D. W.

In these studies, we expand on this possible involvement of HGF in chronic lung injury by showing the following. First, normal adult lung fibroblasts transcribe only small amounts of HGF mRNA, but the steady-state levels of this message rise substantially in lung fibroblasts obtained from animals exposed to oxidative stress. Second, inflammatory cytokines produced early in the injury stimulate the transcription of HGF in isolated fibroblasts, providing a plausible mechanism for the increased amounts of HGF seen in vivo. Third, HGF is capable of significantly inhibiting the synthesis and secretion of the phosphatidylcholines of pulmonary surfactant. Fourth, HGF inhibits the rate-limiting enzyme in de novo phosphatidylcholine synthesis, CTP:choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.15 ). Our data indicate that fibroblast-derived HGF could be partially responsible for the changes in surfactant dysfunction seen in adult respiratory distress syndrome, including the decreases seen in surfactant phosphatidylcholines.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajplung.2000.278.2.L382",""

Our data suggest that SP-B promoter activity is dependent on interactions between factors bound to upstream and downstream regions of the promoter.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajplung.2000.278.3.L477",""

We demonstrate that two imaging methods based on the time derivatives of Q(t) at zero time are capable of producing the average velocity of the electron along the chain using a reasonable number of the time derivatives. We further show that this average velocity increases as the coupling to the phonons is increased and as the temperature is increased; that is, the decay to a steady state is enhanced in both cases.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/112/9/4310/19252138/4310_1_online.pdf",""

There is no inserted element, and no re-arrangement of the chromosome (e.g. inversion or translocation) in the immediate region of Tlr4; the deletion removes only one recognizable gene. Hence, other immunological anomalies that have been identified in C57BL/10ScCr mice (a non-healing phenotype in Leishmania inoculation and failure to produce interferon-γ in response to numerous microbial infections) must be ascribed to one of two causes.

Most kinesin is recovered in supernatants with standard protocols for purification of motor proteins, but kinesin recovered on membrane-bound organelles is tightly bound. Partitioning of kinesin between vesicle and cytosolic fractions is highly sensitive to buffer composition. Addition of eitherN-ethylmaleimide or EDTA to homogenization buffers significantly increased the fraction of kinesin bound to organelles. Given that an antibody against kinesin light chain tandem repeats also releases kinesin from vesicles, these observations indicated that specific cytoplasmic factors may regulate kinesin release from membranes. Kinesin light tandem repeats contain DnaJ-like motifs, so the effects of hsp70 chaperones were evaluated. Hsc70 released kinesin from vesicles in an MgATP-dependent andN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive manner. Recombinant kinesin light chains inhibited kinesin release by hsc70 and stimulated the hsc70 ATPase. Hsc70 actions may provide a mechanism to regulate kinesin function by releasing kinesin from cargo in specific subcellular domains, thereby effecting delivery of axonally transported materials.","",""

Plunger lift is often applied to remove produced (or condensed) water, reduce bottomhole flowing pressure, and increase both gas production rate and ultimate recovery. Previous authors have discussed dynamic models of the plunger lift process. However, these previous models considered only stabilized reservoir production. Because of the assumption that reservoir production is stabilized, these older models have only limited applicability to tight gas wells. This paper presents a study of the application of plunger lift to the problem of water removal from tight gas wells. A numerical simulation model was developed which includes gas flow in the reservoir, wellbore/annulus effects, and dynamic plunger lift cycles. Transient reservoir performance is an important feature of the new model. Transient reservoir performance is a significant factor for tight gas reservoirs, especially as average reservoir pressure decreases during the life of the reservoir.","https://onepetro.org/SPEGTS/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/59747-MS/2967875/spe-59747-ms.pdf",""

The deletion removes 74723 bp of DNA, with reference to the control strain 129/J (from which the complete sequence of the Tlr4 locus was obtained). There is no inserted element, and no re-arrangement of the chromosome (e.g. inversion or translocation) in the immediate region of Tlr4; the deletion removes only one recognizable gene. Hence, other immunological anomalies that have been identified in C57BL/10ScCr mice (a non-healing phenotype in Leishmania inoculation and failure to produce interferon-γ in response to numerous microbial infections) must be ascribed to one of two causes. Mutation(s) at other loci may be responsible for these defects. Alternatively, Tlr4 locus deletion may have phenotypic consequences that exceed the well known blockade of LPS signal transduction.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/09680519000060010701",""

Approaches to travel time estimation traditionally have been based on aggregate data sets that examine travel times over a number of days or travel times in previous time intervals. Automatic vehicle identification data make it possible to analyze travel time data at a totally disaggregate or individual commuter level. It is postulated in this research that the capability of modeling travel characteristics on a disaggregate level can improve the accuracy with which performance measures are quantified. The test beds examined are a 22-km section of the I-10 corridor and a 21-km section of the US-290 corridor in Houston, Texas. It was found that aggregation across days, which does not consider the effect of individual days, is 63 percent less accurate than aggregation by days, which does consider the effect of individual days. Even though the latter technique was found to be more accurate, it was illustrated that 40 percent of the regular commuters’ travel times are statistically different from these aggregate estimates. Similarly, for travel time variability, it was found that for approximately 20 percent of the cases the travel time standard deviations for regular commuters are statistically different from the aggregate estimates. These results illustrate the uniqueness of an individual commuter’s travel patterns and emphasize the benefit of conducting analyses at the level of the individual commuter for both ATIS and sustainable transportation.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/1725-12",""

We studied the macromolecular interactions involved in coronavirus assembly in cells infected with a murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Coimmunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated an interaction between N protein and M protein in infected cells. Pulse-labeling experiments showed that newly synthesized, unglycosylated M protein interacted with N protein in a pre-Golgi compartment, which is part of the MHV budding site. Coimmunoprecipitation analyses further revealed that M protein interacted with only genomic-length MHV mRNA, mRNA 1, while N protein interacted with all MHV mRNAs. These data indicated that M protein interacted with the nucleocapsid, consisting of N protein and mRNA 1, in infected cells. The M protein-nucleocapsid interaction occurred in the absence of S and E proteins. Intracellular M protein-N protein interaction was maintained after removal of viral RNAs by RNase treatment. However, the M protein-N protein interaction did not occur in cells coexpressing M protein and N protein alone. These data indicated that while the M protein-N protein interaction, which is independent of viral RNA, occurred in the M protein-nucleocapsid complex, some MHV function(s) was necessary for the initiation of M protein-nucleocapsid interaction. The M protein-nucleocapsid interaction, which occurred near or at the MHV budding site, most probably represented the process of specific packaging of the MHV genome into MHV particles.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.74.17.8127-8134.2000",""

Previously, we reported an immature secretion phenotype caused by a highly frequent mutation at amino acid 97 of the HBV core (capsid) protein (HBcAg). This phenotype is characterized by a nonselective and excessive secretion of virions containing an immature genome of single-stranded viral DNA. To extend our study of virion secretion to other naturally occurring variants, we have characterized mutations at HBcAg codons 5, 38, and 60 via site-directed mutagenesis. Although the phenotype of the mutation at codon 38 is nearly identical to that for the wild-type virus, our study reveals that a single mutation at codon 5 or 60 exhibits a new extracellular phenotype with significantly reduced virion secretion yet maintains normal intracellular viral DNA replication. A complementation study indicates that the mutant core protein alone is sufficient for the “low-secretion” phenotype. Furthermore, the low-secretion phenotype of the codon 5 mutant appears to be induced by the loss of a parental proline residue, rather than by the gain of a new amino acid. Our study underscores the core protein as another crucial determinant in virion secretion, in addition to the known envelope proteins. Our present results suggest that a very precise structure of both α-helical and nonhelical loop regions of the entire HBcAg molecule is important for virion secretion. The low-secretion variants may contribute to the phenomenon of gradually decreasing viremia in chronic carriers during the late phase of persistent infection.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.74.19.9099-9105.2000",""

Our calculation found a shape resonance occurs in the 1σg−1 channel. However, this resonance is not the dominant feature in photoabsorption spectrum due to strong shake-up intensities at about the same position, in agreement with the high-resolution photoelectron spectra. The 1σg−1 and 1σu−1 channels have been identified as having different dynamics in the core ionization process. The calculated intensity ratio between these two channels agrees well with the recent measurement. Electron correlation in the target states is found to have a great impact on the computed cross sections and asymmetry parameters. In the coupled-channel scattering calculation, an insufficient treatment of target electron correlation leads to exaggerated channel coupling effects. A multi-electron resonant process via the doubly excited state (1σg−11πu−11πg+2) was also found in the multichannel calculation. Results are also presented for ionization leading to some shake-up states.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/113/5/1843/19066352/1843_1_online.pdf",""

This fault-tolerant control usually reduces load capacity because the redistribution of the magnetic flux which compensates for the failed coils leads to premature saturation in the stator or journal. A distribution matrix of voltages which consists of a redefined biasing voltage vector and two control voltage vectors can be optimized in a manner that reduces the peak flux density. An elegant optimization method using the Lagrange multiplier is presented in this paper. The linearized control forces can be realized up to certain combination of 5 poles failed for the 8 pole magnetic bearing. Position stiffness and voltage stiffness are calculated for the fault-tolerant magnetic bearings. Simulations show that fault-tolerant control of the multiple poles failed magnetic bearings with a horizontal flexible rotor can be achieved with reduced load capacity.

Cyclic flow variations (CFVs) were induced by crush injury and constriction of the left anterior descending coronary artery in dogs. Systemic infusion of antibodies to P- and L-selectin abolished CFVs, respectively, in 50% and 17% of treated dogs [ P = not significant (NS)]. The combination of P- and L-selectin antibodies suppressed CFVs in 60% of treated dogs ( P = NS). In contrast, systemic selectin blockade by intravenous infusion or local adventitial application of MBPA markedly reduced CFVs and, in addition, reduced myocardial myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. We conclude that inhibition of L-, P-, and E-selectin binding by a small-molecular-weight, noncarbohydrate compound markedly reduces arterial thrombosis, whereas systemic administration of antibodies to L- and P-selectin fail to reproduce this antithrombotic effect. These results underscore the role of selectins in the pathogenesis of arterial thrombosis under high shear stress and suggest that inhibition of P- and L- selectin may not suffice to prevent thrombus formation in this model. The role of E-selectin in thrombus formation in this model awaits further testing.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpheart.2000.279.6.H3065",""

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays an important role in the angiogenesis of numerous solid malignancies including colon cancer. Evidence from preclinical and clinical studies indicates VEGF is the predominant angiogenic factor in human colon cancer and is associated with formation of metastases and poor prognosis. Based on these results, it was hypothesized that inhibition of VEGF receptor activity could inhibit colon cancer liver metastasis. To test this hypothesis, the authors evaluated the ability of a small molecule inhibitor specific for the tyrosine kinase VEGF receptor Flk-1/KDR (SU5416) or multiple tyrosine kinase receptors (SU6668) to inhibit tumor angiogenesis and metastasis in a model of colon cancer hepatic metastasis. Both SU5416 and SU6668 inhibited metastases, microvessel formation, and cell proliferation while increasing tumor cell and endothelial cell apoptosis. These results showed that targeting the VEGF receptor/ligand system is a rational approach to inhibiting tumor growth and prolonging survival.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1634/theoncologist.5-suppl_1-11",""

Progressive changes in the composition of the plasma generated polymers were observed with sequential changes in the duty cycle of the pulsed discharge, as other reaction variables remaining constant. In particular, an increased retention of the aromatic ring of the starting monomer in the polymers is obtained with decreasing plasma duty cycles during film formation, as shown by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier-transform infrared analyses of these films. Dielectric constants of these perfluorinated films are consistently below a value of 2.0, measured over a frequency range of 5×102–1×105 Hz. Although thermal gravimetric analysis of the plasma films revealed significant weight loss beginning at temperature below 300 °C, up to 70%, dramatic improvement in the thermal stability of these films was observed following their thermal annealing at temperature of 350–400 °C under N2. The resultant annealed films exhibit negligible weight loss during subsequent thermogravimetric analysis at temperature as high as 420 °C. Most importantly, this gain in thermal stability of the plasma polymers is achieved with only minor increases in the dielectric constants, along with relatively minor changes in film compositions, following the thermal annealing processes. The implications of this study with respect to low dielectric constant requirements for future smaller feature size integrated circuits are discussed in this work.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-pdf/18/2/799/8202608/799_1_online.pdf",""

In the following studies we characterized the extent of corneal injury following exposure to different concentrations of acetic acid and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in the rabbit low-volume eye test. Groups of rabbits received 3% acetic acid, 10% acetic acid, 2% NaOH, or 8% NaOH and were evaluated in vivo by macroscopic and in vivo confocal microscopic examination and postmortem using a live/dead staining kit and scanning laser confocal microscopic examination. Quantitative assessment of macroscopic scores, corneal surface epithelial cell size, corneal epithelial thickness, corneal thickness, depth of stromal injury, corneal light scattering (confocal microscopy through focusing, CMTF), and number of dead cells was conducted at various times, including the following: at 3 hours and at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 35 days. Based on macroscopic scores, the order of ocular irritancy potential was 3% acetic acid < 2% NaOH < 10% acetic acid < 8% NaOH. Evaluation of the quantitative in vivo and postmortem microscopic live/dead data revealed a slight decrease in epithelial thickness and an increase in dead epithelial cell numbers with 3% acetic acid. With 2% NaOH, significant focal changes in epithelial cell size, epithelial thickness, corneal thickness, and number of dead surface epithelial cells occurred at 3 hours and at 1 day, with injury to only a very small number of corneal stromal keratocytes, despite the presence of epithelial denudation. Changes with 10% acetic acid were similar to those noted with 2% NaOH at 3 hours and 1 day, but these changes were more diffuse and included stromal injury to a depth of 7.2 ± 9.3% of the corneal thickness, with significant numbers of dead keratocytes. Eight percent NaOH, on the other hand, caused focally extensive injury that averaged 26.3 ± 18.4% of the corneal thickness at 1 day, with significant light scattering from the cornea, which did not return to normal by 35 days postinjury. Overall, these data indicate that ocular irritation as a result of acetic acid and NaOH was associated with changes similar to those observed with surfactants (ie, slight irritants damage the corneal epithelium, mild and moderate irritants damage the corneal epithelium and anterior stromal cells, and severe irritants damage the corneal epithelium and deep stroma). To our knowledge, this is the first time that the ocular irritation potential for different types of materials (acid/alkali, surfactants) has been shown to be primarily dependent on the initial area and depth of injury.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/019262330002800506",""

Eighteen control subjects and 36 children with neurofibromatosis underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Twelve subjects with neurofibromatosis had evidence of ADHD and 24 did not. Subjects with neurofibromatosis had significantly larger total corpus callosum area and significantly larger regional measurements in three of seven areas.

The former tends to increase asphalt binder demand, and the latter adversely affects its ability to withstand the crushing effects of traffic loads. Nevertheless, bottom ash is lighter in weight and generally much cheaper than conventional quality aggregates such as crushed limestone, sand, and gravel. Research was undertaken to upgrade the load-bearing characteristics of bottom ash and maximize its use in asphaltic concrete mixtures through sulfur modification. The process essentially coats the ash with liquid sulfur, which, upon cooling, fills the voids on the surface of the particles while increasing their crushing resistance. The results of laboratory investigations indicate that asphaltic concrete mixture designs in which bottom ash represents 50 to 100 percent of the aggregate fraction can be achieved. Sulfur-modified bottom ash (SMBA) mixtures compare favorably with typical Texas Department of Transportation surface course mixtures in terms of strength, durability, and asphalt demand. Results of a field demonstration project in which SMBA was incorporated into hot-mix asphalt concrete are presented. An asphalt batch plant was successfully used to incorporate the sulfur into the bottom ash and produce the hotmix asphalt concrete. The mixture was successfully placed as a 50-mm (2-in.) overlay on an existing asphalt surface at the entry to the asphalt plant facility, and adequate density was achieved with standard compaction equipment. The SMBA hot-mix overlay is currently under traffic by heavy haul trucks entering the plant facility, and early indications of performance are good.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/1723-08",""

NF-kappaB-mediated transcriptional activation of these genes is inhibited by nitric oxide (NO) in a variety of cells, including monocytes. Morphine mediates NO release in a naloxone antagonizable manner in monocytes and neutrophils. Methods: The influence of morphine on NF-kappaB activation was investigated in a whole-blood flow cytometric assay. A specific antibody against the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB was used and detected by fluoresceine-isothiocyanate-labeled anti-immunoglobulin G. Nuclei were stained with propidium iodide. Leukocyte subpopulations were evaluated by gating on neutrophils and monocytes. The median fluorescence channel was determined. Different morphine concentrations (50 nm, 50 microm, 1 mm) and incubation intervals (10-150 min) were used. Results: Morphine inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced NF-kappaB nuclear binding in human blood neutrophils and monocytes in a time-, concentration-, and naloxone-sensitive-dependent manner. Similar effects were achieved with the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl-pencillamine and the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine. The NO synthase inhibitors Nomega-nitro-l-arginine-methyl-esther and Nomega-nitro-l-arginine completely abolished the morphine-induced attenuation of NF-kappaB nuclear binding, demonstrating that the inhibitory action is mediated by NO release. Conclusion: Morphine causes immunosuppression, at least in part, via the NO-stimulated depression of NF-kappaB nuclear binding.","http://pubs.asahq.org/anesthesiology/article-pdf/92/6/1677/430394/0000542-200006000-00027.pdf",""

The data consist of fluorescence emission spectra and decays. Two dyes were embedded in an epoxypolymer base, and only they participated in the energy transfer. Following pulsed laser excitation of the donor dye, energy transfer took place to the accept dye. The possible transfer paths considered here were nonradiative and radiative transfer. The latter involves two steps, emission and absorption of a photon, and therefore is relatively slow, while nonradiative transfer is a fast single step resulting from direct Coulomb interactions. A predominantly nonradiative transfer is desirable for applications, for instance in wavelength shifters in high energy particle detection. We studied the concentration effects of the dyes on the energy transfer and obtained the relative quantum efficiencies of various wavelength shifters from the fluorescence emission spectra. For low acceptor concentrations, radiative transfer was found to dominate, while nonradiative transfer became dominant at increasing dye concentrations. The fluorescence decays were analyzed with a sum-of-exponentials method and with Förster kinetics. The sum of exponential model yielded mean decay times of the dye polymers useful for a general classification. The decay times decreased as desired with increasing acceptor concentration. The samples, in which nonradiative energy transfer dominated, were analyzed with Förster kinetics. As a result, the natural decay times of the donor and acceptor dyes and the critical radii for nonradiative energy transfer were obtained from a global best fit.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/88/8/4860/19213404/4860_1_online.pdf",""

The pathogenesis of so-called nonfamilial lesions is virtually unknown. We discuss, mainly from a molecular perspective, a unique patient with sporadic, recurrent hemangioblastomas restricted to spinal nerve roots. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 53-year-old man who had had a surgically corrected lumbosacral meningomyelocele presented on at least three occasions during a 17-year period with multifocal capillary hemangioblastomas involving spinal nerve roots. On each occasion, tumors appeared on a different nerve root, with the majority located in the midcervical segments. The patient had no clinical features or family history of VHL syndrome. TECHNIQUE: To obtain a clearer understanding of the pathogenesis of this unusual case and its relationship to VHL syndrome, molecular analysis of the VHL gene was performed by use of complete sequence analysis and loss of heterozygosity studies on deoxyribonucleic acid derived from the patient's blood leukocytes and three separately resected hemangioblastomas. CONCLUSION: Germ-line molecular analysis performed on all three exons in the VHL gene coding region did not indicate that any mutations were present. Loss of heterozygosity analysis of deoxyribonucleic acid from the three hemangioblastoma resections showed normal heterozygosity in the 3p25–26 region. Complete VHL gene sequence analysis did not demonstrate a somatic mutation in the coding region of the VHL gene in any of the three tumors, thereby supporting the loss of heterozygosity data that a molecular event directly involving the VHL gene may not be the causative factor in their tumorigenesis.","http://academic.oup.com/neurosurgery/article-pdf/47/6/1443/32549573/00006123-200012000-00038.pdf",""

Requirements for actuator tests are different from motor testing because actuators for robotic application are highly unique and specialized devices with numerous parameters and conditions to be considered. To meet the high demand of a particular application, the actuator must be carefully tested using highly advanced measurement equipment. The first section introduces the 4-test bed suite for the evaluation environment of modern actuators with their purposes and measurement parameters. General information on the performance testing of actuators is also given. The hardware and software environment of the Actuator Endurance and Reliability Test Bed (AERTB) is then described in depth. Preliminary tests have been done to verify and check the proper operation of the test bed. Test results show that the developed test bed offers excellent testing capability of robot actuators with ease of use.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/DETC2000/MECH-14160/6610244/995_1.pdf",""

The contributions of this research are (1) to help identify the requirements for a simulation designed for use during operations and (2) the development of a methodology for using sim ulation, along with rational agents, to compare the real, ongoing operation with the planned operation and make recommendations when appropriate.

The electrostatic complexes, Li−(H2)n, are very weakly bound (De&lt;0.25 kcal/mol with respect to H2 loss) and H2/H2 interactions play a contributing role in determining the equilibrium structures within the electrostatic constraint of a linear or near-linear Li−–H–H orientation. The covalent molecular ion, LiH2−, is found to have a linear centrosymmetric structure and to be bound with respect to Li−+H2 in agreement with previous calculations. The interaction of LiH2− with additional H2 is purely electrostatic but with a De larger than those of the Li−(H2)n complexes. LiH2−(H2) is found to have a linear equilibrium structure and LiH2−(H2)2 is found to have two almost isoenergetic structures: linear with an H2 on either end of the LiH2−, and C2v with both H2 on the same end of the LiH2−. Of particular interest is the dramatic change in the nature of the transition state for LiH2− production depending on the number of H2 molecules present. For n=1, the reaction proceeds through a conical intersection between the lowest energy B21 and A11 electronic surfaces in C2v symmetry. For n=2, the reaction occurs on a single surface in a pericyclic mechanism through a transition state consisting of a planar five-member ring where simultaneously two H2 bonds are broken while two LiH bonds and one new H2 bond are formed. For n=3, the reaction proceeds by direct insertion of Li− into one of the H2 molecules with the two additional H2 molecules providing substantial stabilization of the transition state by taking on part of the negative charge in a weakly covalent interaction. The results are discussed in comparison to the isoelectronic B+/(H2)n systems where significant sigma bond activation through a cooperative interaction mechanism has been identified recently.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/113/15/6122/10826707/6122_1_online.pdf",""

This paper presents preliminary results from a 3D model for simulating the growth of carbonate platforms, focusing especially on the behavior of platform-margin facies tracts. The 3D model, described here for the first time, was used to investigate the impact of changing sea level on the growth of carbonate platforms, using a range of initial seafloor gradients. The initial depositional surface used in the model features an along-strike transition from gently dipping to more steeply dipping profiles. Simulations were performed to investigate different aspects of platform growth in response to a single cycle of sea-level change (200-meter amplitude, 200,000 yr cycle duration). Using low (?1°) initial gradients, the model produces a complex depositional unit that consists of several detached platform-margin 'terraces,' each of which has a relatively lowrelief final profile. Following the full cycle of sea-level change, the final depositional unit contains highly diachronous facies boundaries with significant facies dislocations. In contrast, using the same sea-level oscillation, but a steeper (?16°) initial depositional gradient, the model creates a narrower platform, with a terminal depositional profile that is steeper overall. Internal chronostratigraphic relationships within the final depositional unit are also complex, although facies dislocations are more areally limited than in the lowgradient example.","http://onepetro.org/OTCONF/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.4043/12200-MS/1911816/otc-12200-ms.pdf",""

Analyses showed that traffic speeds in the work zones 4 to 6 months after the law was enacted were essentially unchanged from before the law was enacted. Similarly, citation frequency and fines levied were not significantly higher than they were before enactment of the law. The data suggested that a higher proportion of drivers who were issued citations after the law was implemented chose to take defensive driving training and to have the ticket subsequently dismissed.

Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), an important mediator of lung inflammation, inhibits surfactant phospholipid and surfactant protein synthesis in the lung. In the present study, we investigated the TNF-α inhibition of rabbit SP-B promoter activity in a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line (NCI-H441). Deletion experiments indicated that the TNF-α response elements are located within −236 bp of SP-B 5′-flanking DNA. The TNF-α response region contained binding sites for nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), Sp1/Sp3, thyroid transcription factor (TTF)-1, and hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-3 transcription factors. Inhibitors of NF-κB activation such as dexamethasone and N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone and mutation of the NF-κB element did not reverse TNF-α inhibition of SP-B promoter, indicating that TNF-α inhibition of SP-B promoter activity occurs independently of NF-κB activation. TNF-α treatment decreased the binding activities of TTF-1 and HNF-3 elements without altering the nuclear levels of TTF-1 and HNF-3α proteins. Pretreatment of cells with okadaic acid reversed TNF-α inhibition of SP-B promoter activity. Taken together these data indicated that in NCI-H441 cells 1) TNF-α inhibition of SP-B promoter activity may be caused by decreased binding activities of TTF-1 and HNF-3 elements, 2) the decreased binding activities of TTF-1 and HNF-3α are not due to decreased nuclear levels of the proteins, and 3) okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatases may be involved in mediating TNF-α inhibition of SP-B promoter activity.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajplung.2000.279.5.L806",""

Based on the experimental observations, a mathematical model of acidizing naturally-fractured carbonates has been developed. The model includes bulk solution transport, acid transport and reaction, and the change of fracture width by acid dissolution. A new approach was used to treat leakoff acid and acid-rock reactions at the fracture walls. The new acidizing model for numerically generated rough-surfaced fractures predicts the same kinds of acid etching patterns and the same relationships between acid etching patterns and the fracture width, surface roughness and leakoff rate as observed in experiments.","https://onepetro.org/SPEATCE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/63183-MS/2962190/spe-63183-ms.pdf",""

We found that the NT/N gene was expressed in human colon cancer cell line KM12C but not in KM20 colon cancer cells. Bisulfite genomic sequencing demonstrated that all CpG dinucleotides in the region from −373 to +100 of the NT/N promoter, including a CpG site in a distal consensus AP-1 site, were methylated in KM20 but unmethylated in KM12C cells. Treatment of KM20 cells with demethylating agent 5-azacytidine induced NT/N expression, suggesting a role for DNA methylation in silencing of NT/N in colon cancers. To better elucidate the mechanisms responsible for NT/N repression by DNA methylation, we performed gel shift assays using an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the distal AP-1 consensus sequence of the NT/N promoter. Methylation of the oligonucleotide probe inhibited protein binding to the distal AP-1 site of the NT/N promoter, suggesting a potential mechanism of NT/N gene repression in colon cancers. We show that DNA methylation plays a role in NT/N gene silencing in the human colon cancer KM20 and that NT/N expression in KM12C cells is associated with demethylation of the CpG sites.

However, the mechanisms involved in specification of different chamber lineages are unclear. The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor dHAND is expressed in cardiac precursors throughout the cardiac crescent and the linear heart tube, before becoming restricted to the right ventricular chamber at the onset of looping morphogenesis. dHAND is also expressed in the branchial arch neural crest, which contributes to craniofacial structures and the aortic arch arteries. Using a series of dHAND-lacZ reporter genes in transgenic mice, we show that cardiac and neural crest expression of dHAND are controlled by separate upstream enhancers and we describe a composite cardiac-specific enhancer that directs lacZ expression in a pattern that mimics that of the endogenous dHAND gene throughout heart development. Deletion analysis reduced this enhancer to a 1.5 kb region and identified subregions responsible for expression in the right ventricle and cardiac outflow tract. Comparison of mouse regulatory elements required for right ventricular expression to the human dHAND upstream sequence revealed two conserved consensus sites for binding of GATA transcription factors. Mutation of these sites abolished transgene expression in the right ventricle, identifying dHAND as a direct transcriptional target of GATA factors during right ventricle development. Since GATA factors are not chamber-restricted, these findings suggest the existence of positive and/or negative coregulators that cooperate with GATA factors to control right ventricular-specific gene expression in the developing heart.","https://journals.biologists.com/dev/article-pdf/127/24/5331/2840563/develop_127_24_5331.pdf",""

A year by treatment interaction was found for the jointing disease index, and plants grown from seed treated with imazalil had a significantly lower disease index than those grown from nontreated seed.

Conductance measurement offers a method to generate an instantaneous left ventricular (LV) volume signal in the mouse but has been limited by the volume signal being a combination of blood and LV muscle. We hypothesized that by developing a mouse conductance system that operates at several simultaneous frequencies, we could identify and correct for the myocardial contribution to the instantaneous volume signal. This hypothesis is based on the assumption that mouse myocardial conductivity will vary with frequency, whereas mouse blood conductivity will not. Consistent with this hypothesis, we demonstrated that at higher excitation frequency, greater end-diastolic and end-systolic conductance are detected, as well as a smaller difference between the two. We then empirically solved for LV blood volume using two frequencies. We combined measured resistivity of mouse myocardium with an analytic approach and extracted an estimate of LV blood volume from the raw conductance signal. Development of a multifrequency catheter-based system to determine LV function could be a tool to assess cardiovascular phenotype in transgenic mice.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpheart.2000.279.3.H1411",""

Previously we have identified the bag-of-marbles (bam) gene as an intrinsic factor for cystoblast fate in Drosophila germline cells and shown that it requires active product from the benign gonial cell neoplasm (bgcn) gene. Here we present the cloning and characterization of bgcn. The predicted Bgcn protein is related to the DExH-box family of RNA-dependent helicases but lacks critical residues for ATPase and helicase functions. Expression of the bgcn gene is extremely limited in ovaries but, significantly, bgcn mRNA is expressed in a very limited number of germline cells, including the stem cells. Also, mutations in bgcn dominantly enhance a bam mutant phenotype, further corroborating the interdependence of these two genes' functions. On the basis of known functions of DExH-box proteins, we propose that Bgcn and Bam may be involved in regulating translational events that are necessary for activation of the cystoblast differentiation program.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/155/4/1809/42028117/genetics1809.pdf",""

Diffusion penetration profiles were obtained by using secondary ion mass spectrometry depth profiling techniques. For the deposited and implanted Ti+ samples, the bulk diffusion coefficients (D) are 5.4×10−21 and 5.6×10−17 m2 s−1, respectively, and dislocation diffusion coefficients are 3.6×10−17 and 1.4×10−12 m2 s−1, respectively. Comparing the D's for Ti in the undamaged and damaged Al2O3, the D's for the latter samples are higher by a factor of 104–105, reflecting the radiation enhanced diffusion due to the defect structure inflected by the implanted 7 keV Ti+46. Comparing the D's for Ti deposited onto Al2O3 (both the evaporated and 100 eV Ti+48 samples) with those for Cr deposited onto Al2O3, the Ti D's are larger by a factor of 10, reflecting the influence of the valence state of the cation. These results show that cationic diffusion coefficients in Al2O3 can be controlled by varying the level of defects in the crystal.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/113/12/5058/19276821/5058_1_online.pdf",""

Because only eight publications were found that met their selection criteria, the authors conducted a focus group with teachers of students with E/BD. Among the themes voiced by teachers were the emotional variability of their students, fear of failure and trust issues, and the ensuing challenges of motivating students. Both the literature review and the focus group indicated that cross-age tutoring and direct or explicit instruction may hold some promise for students with E/BD. However, neither the review nor the focus group revealed specific instructional procedures that are helpful with these students. The lack of a knowledge base in this area is particularly disturbing given the current priority placed on early reading, the push toward inclusion, and the requirement of access to the general education curriculum for students with E/BD.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/019874290002500201",""

Here, we describe a method for free‐surface multiple attenuation using a reflection operator model of a seismic record, derived using the well‐known invariant embedding technique. We implement this method in the 2-D plane‐wave domain, where lateral variation of the geological structure of the earth is taken into account by the coupling of different ray parameters. In situations where the lateral variations are smooth, the data are well compressed in the 2-D plane‐wave domain and the resultant bandlimited matrices significantly reduce the computation cost. One important feature of the proposed method is its flexibility, which allows for the removal of multiples from selected reflections. To generate multiple free data, wave‐theory‐based multiple attenuation methods attempt to estimate either the source function or the subsurface reflectivity. Our method takes advantage of both approaches, such that we initially predict multiple traveltime using the reflectivity approach and then seek a source function to predict the amplitudes. Synthetic and real data examples show that this method is stable and successful in attenuating the surface multiples.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/1.1444717",""

A refined quantum chemical dipole surface of interacting H2–He pairs is also obtained with an extended grid of molecular geometries. This dipole surface agrees generally well with previous results, but is smaller by about 5% in the isotropic overlap term which is significant only in the fundamental band. The effects of the anisotropy of the interaction are to reduce the peak intensities of the Q and S lines by roughly 10% and to increase absorption in the far wings by a similar amount. The accuracy of the dipole surface as well as that of the ab initio interaction potential that enters the calculations of the spectra are believed to permit the prediction of absolute spectral intensities with an accuracy of about ±5%. Comparisons with the available measurements show very good agreement of the shapes of the spectral profiles, but the absolute intensities differ by up to 10% in some cases. These remaining differences between theory and measurements appear to be random and are generally smaller than the differences among comparable measurements. Our results should therefore provide a reliable basis for predicting absorption by H2–He pairs for temperatures and frequencies for which no laboratory measurements exist. This fact is of a special interest, for example, for the spectroscopic analyses of the atmospheres of the outer planets.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/113/9/3641/19134908/3641_1_online.pdf",""

Here, we describe a method for free‐surface multiple attenuation using a reflection operator model of a seismic record, derived using the well‐known invariant embedding technique. We implement this method in the 2-D plane‐wave domain, where lateral variation of the geological structure of the earth is taken into account by the coupling of different ray parameters. In situations where the lateral variations are smooth, the data are well compressed in the 2-D plane‐wave domain and the resultant bandlimited matrices significantly reduce the computation cost. One important feature of the proposed method is its flexibility, which allows for the removal of multiples from selected reflections. To generate multiple free data, wave‐theory‐based multiple attenuation methods attempt to estimate either the source function or the subsurface reflectivity. Our method takes advantage of both approaches, such that we initially predict multiple traveltime using the reflectivity approach and then seek a source function to predict the amplitudes. Synthetic and real data examples show that this method is stable and successful in attenuating the surface multiples.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/1.1444717",""

However, the basis for this enhanced sensitivity to 1,25-(OH)2D3 is unclear. To address this question, we examined 24-hydroxylase and 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor (VDR) messenger RNA (mRNA) expression during human osteoclast differentiation from normal subjects and patients with Paget's disease in response to 1,25-(OH)2D3 as well as VDR content and affinity. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of granulocyte–macrophage colony–forming unit (GM-CFU), the earliest identifiable osteoclast precursor, derived from patients with Paget's disease demonstrated 24-hydroxylase mRNA expression in response to 1,25-(OH)2D3 was induced at concentrations of 1,25-(OH)2D3 that were at least one log less than that required for normal GM-CFU. VDR mRNA and VDR protein were detected in both immature and more differentiated osteoclast precursors, as well as in osteoclast-like multinucleated cells (MNCs). However, VDR expression was lower in MNCs than the mononuclear precursor cells. Osteoclast precursors and MNCs from patients with Paget's disease had levels of VDR expression similar to those of normal subjects but showed increased VDR affinity for 1,25-(OH)2D3. Because the effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 are in part mediated by induction of expression of RANK ligand on marrow stromal cells, which in turn stimulates osteoclast formation, we examined expression of RANK ligand mRNA by marrow stromal cell lines derived from patients with Paget's disease and normal subjects in response to 1,25-(OH)2D3. RT-PCR analysis showed no difference in sensitivity of marrow stromal cells to 1,25-(OH)2D3 from normal subjects or patients with Paget's disease although the Paget's stromal cells expressed increased basal levels of RANK ligand mRNA. These results show that VDR protein is expressed in early and more differentiated osteoclast precursors, that expression levels of VDR decline with osteoclast differentiation, and that 1,25-(OH)2D3 has direct effects on osteoclast precursors. The enhanced sensitivity to 1,25-(OH)2D3 is an intrinsic property of osteoclast precursors from patients with Paget's disease that distinguishes them from normal osteoclast precursors. Furthermore, our results suggest that an increased affinity of VDR for 1,25-(OH)2D3 may be responsible for the enhanced 1,25-(OH)2D3 sensitivity of osteoclast precursors in patients with Paget's disease compared with normal subjects.

G protein GAPs act allosterically on Gα subunits, in contrast to GAPs for the Ras-like monomeric GTP-binding proteins. Although they do not contribute directly to the chemistry of GTP hydrolysis, G protein GAPs can accelerate hydrolysis >2000-fold. G protein GAPs include both effector proteins (phospholipase C-β, p115RhoGEF) and a growing family of regulators of G protein signaling (RGS proteins) that are found throughout the animal and fungal kingdoms. GAP activity can sharpen the termination of a signal upon removal of stimulus, attenuate a signal either as a feedback inhibitor or in response to a second input, promote regulatory association of other proteins, or redirect signaling within a G protein signaling network. GAPs are regulated by various controls of their cellular concentrations, by complex interactions with Gβγ or with Gβ5 through an endogenous Gγ-like domain, and by interaction with multiple other proteins.","https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.biochem.69.1.795",""

In this study, we investigated the effects of actomyosin interaction on endothelial barrier function and gap formation.

Uptake of the activated protein resulted in a significant shift in myosin light chain (MLC) from an unphosphorylated to a diphosphorylated form. In addition, MLCK induced a hyperpermeability response of the monolayer as measured by albumin transendothelial flux. Microscopic examination of MLCK-treated CVECs revealed widespread gap formation in the monolayer, loss of peripheral β-catenin, and increases in actin stress fibers. Inhibition of all of the above responses by a specific MLCK inhibitor suggests they are the direct result of exogenously added MLCK. These data suggest that activation of MLCK in CVECs causes phosphorylation of MLC and contraction of CVECs, resulting in gap formation and concomitant increases in permeability.

Many experimental and theoretical studies in carbonate acidizing have confirmed the existence of an optimal acid injection rate at which major wormholes are formed, and the benefit from stimulation is maximized. This optimal rate depends on reservoir conditions, rock properties and chemical reaction rate. At high reservoir temperature, the optimal rate of hydrochloric acid is usually too high, and it sometimes is beyond the maximum injection allowed (the rate to avoid fracturing formation). In this case, weak acids, such as acetic acid, are alternative fluids to stimulate the wells. In our previous study, a theoretical model showed that under the same condition, the optimal injection rate for weak acids is relatively lower than the one for strong acids.","https://onepetro.org/SPEFD/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/58715-MS/2967148/spe-58715-ms.pdf",""

The strong effect of nonattendance on mortality risk is robust, pervasive, and remarkably strong across all subgroups of the population, whereas a moderate level of attendance is associated with higher mortality risk among young adults, men, and Southerners, but not among older adults, women, and non-Southerners. Among African Americans, lack of religious involvement appears to be associated with risk of premature death, whereas frequent religious involvement stands out as a critical protective factor that contributes to lower mortality and longer life.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0164027500226003",""

We hypothesized that there would be a pronounced loss of satellite cell proliferative potential in gastrocnemius muscles of aged rats (25- to 30-mo-old FBN rats) subjected to three cycles of atrophy by hindlimb immobilization (plaster casts) with intervening recovery periods. Our results indicated that there was a significant loss in gastrocnemius muscle mass and in the proliferative potential of the resident satellite cells after just one bout of immobilization. Neither the muscle mass nor the satellite cell proliferation potential recovered from their atrophied values after either the first 3-wk or later 9-wk recovery period. Remarkably, application of insulin-like growth factor I onto the atrophied gastrocnemius muscle for an additional 2 wk after this 9-wk recovery period rescued ∼46% of the lost muscle mass and dramatically increased proliferation potential of the satellite cells from this muscle.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jappl.2000.89.4.1365",""

Residents in AY 1996–1997 (n = 36) served as a study group who completed a structured 12-week program of reading materials, small group discussions, and case scenarios. Methods.: A needs assessment identified 7 topic areas in health maintenance: health screening, immunizations, nutrition, development, behavior, injury prevention, and dental health. Control and study residents' cognitive knowledge, chart documentation, and clinical performance were assessed using a 50-item multiple choice examination, medical records audit, and standardized patient evaluations. Results.: Mean examination scores, chart documentation, and clinical performance did not differ significantly between first- and second-year control residents. In the study group, mean examination scores of first-year residents were not significantly better than controls. Second-year residents significantly improved their knowledge about health screening, nutrition, and dental health compared with controls but showed no improvement in other areas. Medical record documentation increased significantly among study residents compared with control residents. Clinically, first-year residents significantly improved in the task of health screening (relative risk [RR] 6.33) and markedly improved (36.8% vs 66.7%) their injury prevention counseling compared with controls. Second-year residents showed significant increases in health screening (RR 6.09) and taking a nutritional history (RR 1.44) compared with controls. Assessment of the curriculum by residents showed a high degree of satisfaction with the program. Conclusions.: Pediatric residents who had clinical experience and completed the curriculum demonstrated significant improvements in their medical record documentation and selective gains in knowledge and clinical performance of health maintenance compared with residents with clinical experience only. A structured curriculum in health maintenance and a multifaceted assessment system can identify and enhance the skills of pediatric residents.","https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-pdf/105/Supplement_3/966/823637/966.pdf",""

Previously, we demonstrated that the human gastric cancer SIIA possesses GRP-R and that BBS stimulates activator protein-1 (AP-1) gene expression. The purpose of our present study was to determine the signaling pathways leading to AP-1 induction in SIIA cells. A rapid induction of c- jun and jun-B gene expression was noted after BBS treatment; this effect was blocked by specific GRP-R antagonists, indicating that BBS is acting through the GRP-R. The signaling pathways leading to increased AP-1 gene expression were delineated using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), which stimulates protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent pathways, by forskolin (FSK), which stimulates protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent pathways, and by the use of various protein kinase inhibitors. Treatment with PMA stimulated AP-1 gene expression and DNA binding activity similar to the effects noted with BBS; FSK stimulated jun-B expression but produced only minimal increases of c- jun mRNA and AP-1 binding activity. Pretreatment of SIIA cells with either H-7 or H-8 (primarily PKC inhibitors) inhibited the induction of c- jun and jun-B mRNAs in response to BBS, whereas H-89 (PKA inhibitor) exhibited only minimal effects. Pretreatment with tyrphostin-25, a protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitor, attenuated the BBS-mediated induction of c- jun and jun-B, but the effect was not as pronounced as with H-7. Collectively, our results demonstrate that BBS acts through its receptor to produce a rapid induction of both c- jun and jun-B mRNA and AP-1 DNA binding activity in the SIIA human gastric cancer. Moreover, this induction of AP-1, in response to BBS, is mediated through both PKC- and PTK-dependent signal transduction pathways with only minimal involvement of PKA.","https://journals.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpcell.2000.279.2.C326",""

We used working rat hearts perfused at physiological workload and levels of the major energy substrates and compared the metabolic and contractile responses to an acute low-to-high work transition under resting versus exercising systemic metabolic conditions (low vs. high lactate and nonesterified fatty acids in the perfusate). Glycogen preservation, resulting from better maintenance of high-energy phosphates, was a consequence of improved energy homeostasis with high fat and lactate. We explained the result by tighter coupling between workload and total β-oxidation. Total fatty acid oxidation with high fat and lactate reflected increased availability of exogenous and endogenous fats for respiration, as evidenced by increased long-chain fatty acyl-CoA esters (LCFA-CoAs) and by an increased contribution of triglycerides to total β-oxidation. Triglyceride turnover (synthesis and degradation) also appeared to increase. Elevated LCFA-CoAs caused high total β-oxidation despite increased malonyl-CoA. The resulting bottleneck at mitochondrial uptake of LCFA-CoAs stimulated triglyceride synthesis. Our results suggest the following. First, both malonyl-CoA and LCFA-CoAs determine total fatty acid oxidation in heart. Second, concomitant stimulation of peripheral glycolysis and lipolysis should improve cardiac energy homeostasis during exercise. We speculate that high lactate contributes to the salutary effect by bypassing the glycolytic block imposed by fatty acids, acting as an anaplerotic substrate necessary for high tricarbocylic acid cycle flux from fatty acid-derived acetyl-CoA.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpheart.2000.279.4.H1490",""

The results show that the energy level of the ground vibronic state, which is triply degenerate T for small quadratic coupling g values, intersects the next A level with increasing g, thus realizing the nondegenerate ground state at sufficiently large g values. This result reverses the long-standing belief that the ground vibronic state for the T⊗t2 system has the same degeneracy and symmetry T as the initial electronic state. To explain these results in terms of Berry phase requirements and conical intersections, the adiabatic potential energy surface of the system is analyzed, and the relationships among the type and number of minima, conical intersections, and relevant tunneling paths are revealed. Depending on the vibronic coupling parameter values, there are four trigonal minima and six orthorhombic saddle points, which become minima at large g values, plus ten lines of conical intersections on the lowest potential energy surface. The barriers between the minima are significantly increased near the lines of conical intersections where the Born–Huang terms diverge. For small enough quadratic coupling, only four lines of conical intersections that originate from the highest symmetry point and proceed along the four trigonal directions are significant in determining the Berry phase, and the triply degenerate ground T state is obtained. By increasing the quadratic coupling parameter, the remaining six lines of conical intersections approach the point of highest symmetry, thus allowing for alternative tunneling paths and Berry phases which lead to the nondegenerate A ground state. This explanation of the origin of the nondegenerate ground state for some range of values of the vibronic coupling parameters is strengthened by model calculations of tunneling splitting.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/112/19/8470/19290490/8470_1_online.pdf",""

Most of these studies simulate a relatively unperturbed boundary layer flow approaching the coolant holes. This stimulated the current inquiry into the effects of realistic upstream conditions for downstream coolant holes. To investigate this, a series of experiments were performed focussing on the first downstream row of holes on the pressure side of a typical turbine vane. The film cooling effectiveness for this pressure side row of holes was determined subject to no showerhead blowing, and to showerhead blowing with varying blowing rates. Furthermore, tests were conducted with low and high freestream turbulence levels. For this investigation, a leading edge showerhead array of six film cooling rows was utilized, with coolant from three of these rows being directed towards the pressure side of the vane. For all experiments a coolant to freestream density ratio of nominally DR = 1.8 was used. Adiabatic effectiveness was determined from surface temperature measurements for a nominally adiabatic surface using an infrared camera for spatially resolved mapping of the surface temperature. This study showed that showerhead injection had a dominant influence on the adiabatic effectiveness performance of downstream cooling. Showerhead injection appeared to cause a significant increase in coolant jet dispersion, presumably by increased levels of turbulence. Even when the freestream turbulence level at the pressure side coolant holes was increased to 17%, showerhead injection caused a significant degradation in the film cooling performance of the pressure side row of holes. Because of the increased dispersion caused by the showerhead injection for the pressure side coolant jets, the superposition model failed to correctly predict adiabatic effectiveness levels for combined showerhead and pressure side coolant injection.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/GT/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/2000-GT-0240/2413949/v003t01a048-2000-gt-0240.pdf",""

However, the role of nonamidated vs. amidated gastrins in colon carcinogenesis has not been defined. We measured intermediate markers of carcinogenesis in transgenic mice overexpressing either progastrin (hGAS) or amidated gastrin (INS-GAS) in response to azoxymethane (AOM). The hGAS mice showed significantly higher numbers of aberrant crypt foci (140–200% increase) compared with that in wild-type (WT) and INS-GAS mice ( P < 0.05) after AOM treatment. The bromodeoxyuridine-labeling index of colonic crypts also was significantly elevated in hGAS mice vs. that in WT and INS-GAS mice. The results therefore provide evidence for a mitogenic and cocarcinogenic role of nonamidated gastrins (progastrin), which is apparently not shared by the amidated gastrins. Although nonamidated gastrins are now believed to mediate mitogenic effects via novel receptors, amidated gastrins mediate biological effects via different receptor subtypes, which may explain the difference in the cocarcinogenic potential of nonamidated vs. amidated gastrins. In conclusion, our results provide strong support for a cocarcinogenic role for nonamidated gastrins in colon carcinogenesis.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpgi.2000.278.3.G390",""

In the present study involving positron emission tomography (PET), a similar finding was shown for rightward versus leftward yaw stimulation. A total of 18 PET scans were obtained from six subjects in response to either leftward or rightward WFOV motion in a collimated display subtending > 100 ∘ horizontally. Rightward stimulation elicited mainly activation throughout the right hemisphere, whereas leftward stimulation elicited mainly activation throughout the left hemisphere.

CRT is a soluble ER lumenal protein, whereas CLNX is a transmembrane protein with a cytosolic domain that contains two consensus motifs for protein kinase (PK) C/proline- directed kinase (PDK) phosphorylation. Using confocal Ca2+ imaging in Xenopus oocytes, we report here that coexpression of CLNX with sarco endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) 2b results in inhibition of intracellular Ca2+ oscillations, suggesting a functional inhibition of the pump. By site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrate that this interaction is regulated by a COOH-terminal serine residue (S562) in CLNX. Furthermore, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate– mediated Ca2+ release results in a dephosphorylation of this residue. We also demonstrate by coimmunoprecipitation that CLNX physically interacts with the COOH terminus of SERCA2b and that after dephosphorylation treatment, this interaction is significantly reduced. Together, our results suggest that CRT is uniquely regulated by ER lumenal conditions, whereas CLNX is, in addition, regulated by the phosphorylation status of its cytosolic domain. The S562 residue in CLNX acts as a molecular switch that regulates the interaction of the chaperone with SERCA2b, thereby affecting Ca2+ signaling and controlling Ca2+-sensitive chaperone functions in the ER.","https://rupress.org/jcb/article-pdf/149/6/1235/1859304/0004132.pdf",""

Sixty-four Likert-type questions were created on the basis of discussions with focus groups of medical trainees, then administered to sixty-two medical students and residents. Total PEAS scores as well as personal preparation and professional role subscales (where higher scores indicated greater concern) possessed excellent internal consistency and reliability. In addition, there were substantial correlations between PEAS scores and the CA-Dying scale, a measure of laypersons' fears about interacting with dying persons. Thus, PEAS adequately assesses the unique communication concerns of physicians in training regarding working with dying persons and their families. Correlations between PEAS scores and age were negative, while those who had experienced the death of a loved one had higher PEAS scores than those who did not. This suggests that for some persons, life experiences may lessen difficulties in dealing with dying persons, while for others, personal losses may exacerbate such concerns.

The maturation defect of NE2G216 has been linked to the structures of N-linked oligosaccharides synthesized by arthropod cells. Analysis of C6/36 cells infected with NE2G216 by transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of dense virus aggregates within cytoplasmic vacuoles and virus aggregates adhered to the cell surface. The virus aggregation phenotype of NE2G216 was reproduced in vertebrate cells (Pro-5) by the addition of 1-deoxymannojirimycin, an inhibitor of carbohydrate processing which limits the processing of N-linked oligosaccharides to structures that are structurally similar, albeit not identical, to those synthesized in C6/36 cells. We conclude that defective maturation of NE2G216 in mosquito cells is due to virion aggregation and retention on the cell surface and that this phenotype is directly linked to the carbohydrate-processing properties of these cells.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.74.23.11398-11406.2000",""

Splitting is simulated numerically (by finite differencing) as a function of crack density, aspect ratio, fluid content, bulk density, and the angle between the crack systems. The type of anisotropy symmetry in media containing two intersecting vertical crack systems depends on the angular relation between the cracks and their relative crack densities, and it may be horizontal transverse isotropy (HTI), tetragonal, orthorhombic, or monoclinic. The transition from one symmetry to another is visible in the splitting behavior. The polarities of the reflected quasi‐shear waves polarized perpendicular and parallel to the source particle motion distinguish between HTI and orthorhombic media. The dependence of the measured amount of splitting on crack density for HTI symmetry is consistent with that predicted theoretically by the shear‐wave splitting factor. In orthorhombic media (with two orthogonal crack systems), a linear increase is observed in splitting when the difference between crack densities of the two orthogonal crack systems increases. Splitting decreases nonlinearly with the intersection angle between the two crack systems from 0° to 90°. Surface and VSP seismograms are simulated for a model with several flat homogeneous layers, each containing vertical cracks with the same and with different orientations. When the crack orientation varies with depth, previously split shear waves are split again at each interface, leading to complicated records, even for simple models. Isotropic and anisotropic three‐component S-wave zero‐offset sections are synthesized for a zero‐offset survey line over a 2.5-D model of a carbonate reservoir with a complicated geometry and two intersecting, dipping crack sets. The polarization direction of the fast shear wave, propagating obliquely through the cracked reservoir, is predicted by theoretical approximations for effective properties of anisotropic media with two nonorthogonal intersecting crack sets.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/1.1444712",""

In the area of reservoir engineering, the sources of uncertainty have three major causes: 1) the model, because it is an imperfect representation of reality, 2) geologic parameters, because of a limited sampling in space and/or time, and 3) measurement errors in the experiments performed to determine inputs. Thus, a statistical treatment that recognizes both the lack of knowledge and the uncertainty of the parameters involved in the forecast of reservoir performance is desirable. Current stochastic-modeling approaches (Monte Carlo simulation and geostatistics) require extensive computational effort for realistic problems. There are numerous reasons for this, but the one that seems to present the largest hurdle is that reservoir predictions require a large number of input parameters. The thrust of this work is to find ways to perform uncertainty predictions with fewer parameters.","https://onepetro.org/SPEAPCIMAM/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/59449-MS/2955718/spe-59449-ms.pdf",""

The conductivity, the complex dielectric permittivity, and the complex magnetic permeability are varied systematically in nine suites of horizontally layered models. The source used is a horizontal transverse‐electric dipole situated at the air‐earth interface. Cole‐Cole relaxation mechanisms define the frequency dependence of the media. Reflection magnitudes and their variations with antenna separation differ substantially, depending on the contrast in electromagnetic properties that caused the reflection. The spectral character of the dielectric and magnetic relaxations produces only second‐order variations in reflection coefficients compared with those associated with contrasts in permittivity, conductivity, and permeability, so they may not be separable even when they are detected. In typical earth materials, attenuation of propagating GPR waves is influenced most strongly by conductivity, followed by dielectric relaxation, followed by magnetic relaxation. A pervasive feature of the simulated responses is a locally high amplitude associated with the critical incident angle at the air‐earth interface in the antenna radiation pattern. Full wavefield simulations of two field data sets from a fluvial/eolian environment are able to reproduce the main amplitude behaviors observed in the data.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/1.1444702",""

Humans and closely related primates, but not other mammals, possess natural anti-Galα1-3Gal antibodies which also, although less avidly, react with melibiose (Galα1-6Glc). Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with melibiose-bovine serum albumin as an antigen, we analyzed bovine anti-alpha galactosyl antibodies with respect to specificity and distribution in individual animals. Inhibition assays showed that melibiose was the strongest inhibitor, followed equally by stachyose (Galα1-6Galα1-6Glcβ1-2Fru) and raffinose (Galα1-6Glcβ1-2Fru) and then by Galβ1-6Gal, Gal, and Galα1-2Gal. Others, including Galα1-3Gal and Galα1-4Gal, only exhibited minor inhibition. Thus, these bovine anti-alpha galactosyl antibodies appeared to preferentially react with Galα1-6Glc or Galα1-6Gal. The distinction of this specificity from that (Galα1-3Gal) of human antibodies was further demonstrated by the poor reaction of bovine serum to the Galα1-3Gal antigen in comparison to human serum. All 27 healthy bovine serum samples of the three age groups (newborn, calf, and adult) tested contained such antibodies with titers increasing with age. The antibodies purified by affinity chromatography using a melibiose-agarose column were mainly of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) isotype with a concentration of >23 μg/ml in most samples. IgG1 was found to be the primary antimelibiose IgG isotype in all age groups by isotype-specific ELISA, but a significant increase in IgG2, an isotype more related to innate immunity, was observed in calves and adults, compared to newborns.

The enzyme exists in at least two isoforms, denoted L-CPT I (liver type) and M-CPT I (skeletal-muscle type), which differ in their kinetic characteristics and tissue distributions. A property apparently unique to L-CPT I is that its sensitivity to malonyl-CoA decreases in vivo with fasting or experimentally induced diabetes. The mechanism of this important regulatory effect is unknown and has aroused much interest. CPT I is an integral outer-membrane protein and displays little activity after removal from the membrane by detergents, precluding direct purification of active protein by conventional means. Here we describe the expression of a 6×His-tagged rat L-CPT I in Pichia pastoris and purification of the detergent-solubilized enzyme in milligram quantities. Reconstitution of the purified product into a liposomal environment yielded a 200-400-fold increase in enzymic activity and restored malonyl-CoA sensitivity. This is the first time that a CPT I protein has been available for study in a form that is both pure and active. Comparison of the kinetic properties of the reconstituted material with those of L-CPT I as it exists in mitochondria prepared from yeast over-expressing the enzyme and in livers from fed or fasted rats permitted novel insight into several aspects of the enzyme's behaviour. The malonyl-CoA response of the liposomal enzyme was found to be greater when the reconstitution procedure was carried out at 22 °C compared with 4 °C (IC50 ≈ 11 μM versus 30 μM, respectively). When the sensitivities of L-CPT I in each of the different environments were compared, they were found to decrease in the following order: fed liver &gt; fasted liver≈ liposomes prepared at 22 °C≈ P. pastoris mitochondria &gt; liposomes prepared at 4 °C. In addition, pre-treatment of L-CPT I liposomes with the membrane-fluidizing reagent benzyl alcohol caused densensitization to the inhibitor. In contrast with the variable response to malonyl-CoA, the liposomal L-CPT I displayed a pH profile and kinetics with regard to the carnitine and acyl-CoA substrates similar to those of the enzyme in fed or fasted liver mitochondria. However, despite a normal sensitivity to malonyl-CoA, L-CPT I in P. pastoris mitochondria displayed aberrant behaviour with regard to each of these other parameters. The kinetic data establish several novel points. First, even after stringent purification procedures in the presence of detergent, recombinant L-CPT I could be reconstituted in active, malonyl-CoA sensitive form. Second, the kinetics of the reconstituted, 6×His-tagged L-CPT I with regard to substrate and pH responses were similar to what is observed with rat liver mitochondria (whereas in P. pastoris mitochondria the enzyme behaved anomalously), confirming that the purified preparation is a suitable model for studying the functional properties of the enzyme. Third, wide variation in the response to the inhibitor, malonyl-CoA, was observed depending only on the enzyme's membrane environment and independent of interaction with other proteins. In particular, the fluidity of the membrane had a direct influence on this parameter. These observations may help to explain the mechanism of the physiological changes in the properties of L-CPT I that occur in vivo and are consistent with the current topographical model of the enzyme.","https://portlandpress.com/biochemj/article-pdf/349/1/179/728058/bj3490179.pdf",""

A simple set of phase evolution equations for the mode is derived: these equations represent an important extension of the well-known equations of Zohm et al. [Europhys. Lett. 11, 745 (1990)] which incorporate a self-consistent calculation of the radial extent of the region of the plasma which corotates with the mode; the width of this region being determined by plasma viscosity. Using these newly developed equations, a comprehensive theory of the influence of a resistive vacuum vessel on error-field locking and unlocking thresholds is developed. Under certain circumstances, a resistive vacuum vessel is found to strongly catalyze locked mode formation. Hopefully, the results obtained in this paper will allow experimentalists to achieve a full understanding of why the so-called “slinky mode” locks in some reversed field pinch devices, but not in others. The locking of the slinky mode is currently an issue of outstanding importance in reversed field pinch research.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pop/article-pdf/7/9/3610/12710236/3610_1_online.pdf",""

PAI-1 belongs to the serpin family of inhibitors and inhibits both free urokinase (uPA) and receptor-bound urokinase (uPA receptor). Although PAI-1 has been related to a poor prognosis in lung carcinoma, mechanisms that regulate its expression in human lung cancer cells are not well understood. We used cultured human small cell and non-small cell lung carcinoma cell lines as model systems to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms that control expression of PAI-1. Levels of PAI-1 protein were significantly increased in selected lung carcinoma cells compared with those in normal small-airway epithelial cells. Corresponding steady-state levels of PAI-1 mRNA were similarly increased in these cells. The half-life of PAI-1 mRNA was prolonged in these lung carcinoma cell lines after transcriptional or translational blockade. We identified a 60-kDa protein that binds the 3′-untranslated region of PAI-1, and complex formation of this binding protein with PAI-1 mRNA reciprocally correlates with mRNA stability. The findings demonstrate that expression of PAI-1 is regulated at the posttranscriptional level in small cell- and non-small cell-derived human lung carcinoma cell lines. Altered regulation of PAI-1 at the posttranscriptional level may contribute to relative overexpression by malignant lung epithelial cells. A newly identified regulatory protein that binds to the 3′-untranslated region of PAI-1 mRNA appears to be involved in the posttranscriptional regulation of PAI-1 gene expression by human lung carcinoma cells in vitro.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajplung.2000.278.1.L148",""

However, the mechanisms responsible for the improved metabolic control are incompletely understood. One proposed mechanism is that rhIGF-I therapy in T2DM may bypass early defects in insulin action (i.e. signal transduction), leading to improved hepatic and/or peripheral insulin sensitivity. To test this hypothesis, we used the euglycemic insulin clamp to measure the response to 7 days of rhIGF-I therapy (80 μg/kg, sc, twice daily) in eight poorly controlled T2DM subjects. rhIGF-I significantly improved fasting (203 ± 12 vs. 134 ± 14 mg/dL; P &lt; 0.01) and day-long (0800–1700 h; 234 ± 11 vs. 153 ± 10 mg/dL; P &lt; 0.01) plasma glucose levels. Basal endogenous glucose production decreased from 3.2 ± 0.2 to 2.7 ± 0.2 mg/kg lean body mass· min (P &lt; 0.03) despite a concomitant decline in the fasting plasma insulin concentration from 13 ± 5 to 5 ± 1 μU/mL (P &lt; 0.01). The decrement in basal endogenous glucose production was closely correlated with the decrement in fasting plasma glucose concentration (r = 0.78; P &lt; 0.01). Whole body insulin-stimulated glucose disposal increased by 27% (from 5.6 ± 0.8 to 7.1 ± 0.8 mg/kg lean body mass·min; P &lt; 0.01), but remained well below that observed in age- and weight-matched healthy subjects. The effects of rhIGF-I on endogenous glucose production and peripheral insulin sensitivity resemble those observed with intensified insulin regimens in T2DM. We conclude that 7 days of sc rhIGF-I improves glucose control by improving hepatic and muscle insulin sensitivity, but it remains markedly abnormal. This indicates that an intrinsic defect(s) responsible for insulin resistance in T2DM cannot be overcome by rhIGF-I treatment.","http://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-pdf/85/9/3077/9058896/jcem3077.pdf",""

This molecular evidence of progesterone resistance, together with the clinical observation of resistance of endometriosis to treatment with progestins, led us to determine the levels of progesterone receptor (PR) isoforms PR-A and PR-B in eutopic endometrial and extra-ovarian endometriotic tissues. It was proposed that progesterone action on target genes is mediated primarily by homodimers of PR-B, whereas the truncated variant PR-A acts as a repressor of PR-B function. Immunoprecipitation, followed by Western blot analysis, was performed to detect bands specific for PR-A and PR-B in paired samples of endometriotic and eutopic endometrial tissues simultaneously biopsed from 18 women undergoing laparoscopy during various phases of the menstrual cycle. PR-B was present in 17 of 18 eutopic endometrial samples, and its level increased in the preovulatory phase, as expected, whereas PR-A was detected in all samples (n = 18) with a similar, but less prominent, cyclic variation in its levels. In endometriotic samples, however, no detectable PR-B could be demonstrated, whereas PR-A was detected in all samples (n = 18), albeit in much lower levels and without any cyclic variation in contrast with the eutopic endometrium. Levels of PR-A and PR-B in endometriotic and eutopic endometrial tissues were determined and compared after normalization to total protein and estrogen receptor-α levels. Using RNase protection assay, we also demonstrated indirectly that only PR-A transcripts were present in endometriotic tissue samples (n = 8), whereas both PR-A and PR-B transcripts were readily detectable in all eutopic endometrial samples (n = 8). This was indicative that failure to detect PR-B protein in endometriotic tissues is due to the absence of PR-B transcripts. We conclude that progesterone resistance in endometriotic tissue from laboratory and clinical observations may be accounted for by the presence of the inhibitory PR isoform PR-A and the absence of the stimulatory isoform PR-B.","http://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-pdf/85/8/2897/9181629/jcem2897.pdf",""

The faf gene encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme required specifically for patterning the compound eye. The DNA sequences of four DNAprim alleles were determined and these define essential protein domains. We show that while flies lacking DNAprim activity are lethal, flies with reduced DNAprim activity display morphological defects in their eyes, and unlike faf mutants, cell cycle abnormalities in larval eye discs.

Eight mGluR subtypes have been cloned and are classified in three subgroups. Group I mGluRs can stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis and activate protein kinase C whereas group II (mGluR2 and 3) and group III (mGluR4, 6, 7, and 8) mGluRs share the ability to inhibit cAMP formation. The present study examined the roles of groups II and III mGluRs in the processing of brief nociceptive information and capsaicin-induced central sensitization of primate spinothalamic tract (STT) cells in vivo. In 11 anesthetized male monkeys ( Macaca fascicularis), extracellular recordings were made from 21 STT cells in the lumbar dorsal horn. Responses to brief (15 s) cutaneous stimuli of innocuous (brush), marginally and distinctly noxious (press and pinch, respectively) intensity were recorded before, during, and after the infusion of group II and group III mGluR agonists into the dorsal horn by microdialysis. Different concentrations were applied for at least 20 min each (at 5 μl/min) to obtain cumulative concentration-response relationships. Values in this paper refer to the drug concentrations in the microdialysis fibers; actual concentrations in the tissue are about three orders of magnitude lower. The agonists were also applied at 10–25 min after intradermal capsaicin injection. The group II agonists (2S,1′S,2′S)-2-(carboxycyclopropyl)glycine (LCCG1, 1 μM-10 mM, n = 6) and (−)-2-oxa-4-aminobicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-4,6-dicarboxylate (LY379268; 1 μM-10 mM, n = 6) had no significant effects on the responses to brief cutaneous mechanical stimuli (brush, press, pinch) or on ongoing background activity. In contrast, the group III agonist L(+)-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (LAP4, 0.1 μM-10 mM, n = 6) inhibited the responses to cutaneous mechanical stimuli in a concentration-dependent manner, having a stronger effect on brush responses than on responses to press and pinch. LAP4 did not change background discharges significantly. Intradermal injections of capsaicin increased ongoing background activity and sensitized the STT cells to cutaneous mechanical stimuli (ongoing activity > brush > press > pinch). When given as posttreatment, the group II agonists LCCG1 (100 μM, n = 5) and LY379268 (100 μM, n = 6) and the group III agonist LAP4 (100 μM, n = 6) reversed the capsaicin-induced sensitization. After washout of the agonists, the central sensitization resumed. Our data suggest that, while activation of both group II and group III mGluRs can reverse capsaicin-induced central sensitization, it is the actions of group II mGluRs in particular that undergo significant functional changes during central sensitization because they modulate responses of sensitized STT cells but have no effect under control conditions.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jn.2000.84.6.2998",""

We found that the stabilized population of MTs was sufficient to maintain a normal beating rate, whereas MT dynamics and detyrosination made no observable contribution. Furthermore, by directly and acutely increasing the level of tubulin within otherwise normally beating cells, we found that the increased tubulin (and MT) levels further depressed the beating rate.

Previous applications of the BEB theory to the silicon hydrides and fluorides have employed a combination of experimental and Koopman’s theorem binding energies. In the current work binding energies have been calculated using the explicitly correlated multiconfigurational spin tensor electron propagator (MCSTEP) method which gives highly accurate ionization potentials for closed- and open-shell systems. Calculations have been performed using cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ basis sets with multiconfigurational self-consistent field (MCSCF) reference wave functions. Comparisons are made between our MCSCF/MCSTEP and previous Hartree–Fock (HF)/Koopman’s theorem results and available experimental data. The use of improved theoretical data does not have a significant effect on the resultant cross-sections; however, our new technique is a viable method for calculating electron impact ionization cross-sections for systems where Koopman’s theorem is known to be unreliable or no experimental data is available.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/113/1/8/19042404/8_1_online.pdf",""

Calculations are carried out in the large aspect-ratio, zero-β, resistive magnetohydrodynamical limit, and incorporate a realistic treatment of plasma viscosity. There are three regimes of operation, depending on the modulation frequency (i.e., the difference in rotation frequency between the island chain and the external perturbation). For slowly modulated islands, the perturbed velocity profile extends across the whole plasma. For strongly modulated islands, the perturbed velocity profile is localized around the island chain, but remains much wider than the chain. Finally, for very strongly modulated islands, the perturbed velocity profile collapses to a boundary layer on the island separatrix, plus a residual profile which extends a few island widths beyond the separatrix. Analytic expressions are obtained for the perturbed velocity profile, the island equation of motion, and the island width evolution equation in each of these three regimes. The ion polarization correction to the island width evolution equation, which has previously been reported to be stabilizing, is found to be destabilizing in all three regimes.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pop/article-pdf/7/12/4983/19071470/4983_1_online.pdf",""

To this end, the dominant model in evolutionary psychology assumes that complex adaptations involving brain or any other tissue are precisely crafted for a specific function and are produced by genes whose alleles all have equal fitness (genetic homomorphism) because sexual recombination would disrupt adaptations produced by genes whose alleles have unequal fitness (genetic polymorphism). This genetically zoomorphic model maintains that humans and other animals have evolved universal neuronal circuits and behavioral adaptations, which in their sum constitute a species-typical nature (a universal human nature for Homo sapiens), and that almost all variation in adaptive behavior among same-sex individuals is due to environmental effects. Alternatively, we assert that a review of currently available data in neuroscience, biology, and psychology strongly suggests that complex adaptations involving brain and other tissues have many imperfections, different functions in different environments, and much polymorphism genetic variation. Our genetically polymorphic model accounts for all these data and predicts that humans and other animal species have evolved many nonuniversal complex behaviors (multiple species-typical behaviors or “human natures”) that differ genetically between males and females, as well as within males and within females. Variability in same-sex behavior is therefore due to both environmental and genetic variation. Our genetically polymorphic model reconciles fundamental assumptions of evolutionary psychology with basic principles of evolutionary biology, behavioral genetics, and neuroscience.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/107385840000600407",""

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with type 2 diabetes (n = 256) who had inadequate glycemic control (HbA1c &gt; or =7.0%) during previous monotherapy were randomly assigned to receive repaglinide (0.5-4.0 mg at meals), troglitazone (200-600 mg once daily), or a combination of repaglinide (1-4 mg at meals) and troglitazone (200-600 mg once daily). After a 4-6 week washout period, the trial assessed 22 weeks of treatment: 3 weeks (weeks 0-2) of forced titration, 11 weeks of fixed-dose treatment (weeks 3-13), and 8 weeks (weeks 14-21) of titration to maximum dose. Changes in HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) values were measured. RESULTS: The combination therapy showed a significant reduction in mean HbA1c values (-1.7%) that was greater than with either type of monotherapy Repaglinide monotherapy resulted in a reduction of HbA1c values that was significantly greater than troglitazone (-0.8 vs. -0.4%) (P &lt; 0.05). Combination therapy was more effective in reducing FPG values (-80 mg/dl) than either repaglinide (-43 mg/dl) or troglitazone (-46 mg/dl) monotherapies. Adverse events were similar in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy with repaglinide and troglitazone leads to better glycemic control than monotherapy with either agent alone. Repaglinide monotherapy was more effective in lowering HbA1c levels than troglitazone monotherapy Repaglinide/troglitazone combination therapy was effective and did not show unexpected adverse events.","https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/23/7/979/451190/10895850.pdf",""

Samples are confined with a low level of oxygen in a reactor of adjustable temperature. The oxygen consumption by the sample is automatically monitored after a preset period. The temperature‐dependent data exhibit Arrhenius behavior. Normally, it is difficult to directly determine the stability at ambient temperatures because of inordinately long time requirements. The close correspondence to Arrhenius behavior makes it possible to use the results obtained at higher temperature to calculate the stability of samples at lower temperature conditions, such as at ambient storage temperature. The effects of sample size, sample particle size, sample fat content and the reproducibility of the method over time were studied using synthetic and bone meal samples. The oxygen consumption was found to be linearly dependent on the amount of sample taken, inversely dependent on the particle diameter, and independent of the exact lipid content, given some minimum lipid content. The results exhibited high day‐to‐day reproducibility. The gasphase FIA system developed in this work is easy to operate. Compared with the currently used method, the sample throughput rate is much faster (2–3h for complete multitemperature characterization of a sample) and the sample requirement is much lower (∼1 g). Furthermore, it eliminates the need to extract and recover the fat from the sample for further processing as is required by the other methods commonly used to measure oxidative stability.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1007%2Fs11746-000-0035-3",""

The method is demonstrated for Al (0.5 wt % Cu) and Cu thin films by performing measurements on (100) Si wafers and Y-cut single-crystal quartz wafers. The CTE, Young’s modulus, and Poisson ratio are found to be 24.3 ppm/°C, 58.9 GPa, and 0.342, respectively, for Al (Cu) thin film, and 17.7 ppm/°C, 104.2 GPa, and 0.352, respectively, for Cu thin film.

ADA-deficient mice die at 3 wk of age from severe respiratory distress. This phenotype is progressive and is linked to perturbations in pulmonary purine metabolism. The inflammatory changes found in the lungs of ADA-deficient mice included an accumulation of activated alveolar macrophages and eosinophils. These changes were accompanied by a pronounced enlargement of alveolar spaces and increases in mucus production in the bronchial airways. The alveolar enlargement was found to be due in part to abnormal alveogenesis. Lowering adenosine and 2′-deoxyadenosine levels using ADA enzyme therapy decreased the pulmonary eosinophilia and resolved many of the lung histopathologies. In addition, genetically restoring ADA to the forestomach of otherwise ADA-deficient mice prevented adenine metabolic disturbances as well as lung inflammation and damage.

Postganglionic sudomotor function was assessed using the Silastic imprint test in nine patients with tuberous sclerosis complex who have at least one hypomelanotic macule greater than 2 cm in diameter. Sweating was induced by iontophoresis with 0.5% pilocarpine nitrate and sweat droplets were counted under a microscope using a 1 X 1 cm grid. Silastic imprint testing of an analogous skin area contralateral to the hypomelanotic macule was measured as a control. Sweat volume quantitation using sweat collectors was performed in five of the subjects. The sweat volume collected from the hypomelanotic macule was reduced compared to the control skin in four of the five subjects. Sweat droplet counts from the hypomelanotic macule were significantly reduced in only one of nine subjects.

In addition, host encoded factors are likely to contribute to plasmid segregation. Direct observation of a 2-μm–derived plasmid in live yeast cells indicates that the multiple plasmid copies are located in the nucleus, predominantly in clusters with characteristic shapes. Comparison to a single-tagged chromosome or to a yeast centromeric plasmid shows that the segregation kinetics of the 2-μm plasmid and the chromosome are quite similar during the yeast cell cycle. Immunofluorescence analysis reveals that the plasmid is colocalized with the Rep1 and Rep2 proteins within the yeast nucleus. Furthermore, the Rep proteins (and therefore the plasmid) tend to concentrate near the poles of the yeast mitotic spindle. Depolymerization of the spindle results in partial dispersion of the Rep proteins in the nucleus concomitant with a loosening in the association between plasmid molecules. In an ipl1-2 yeast strain, shifted to the nonpermissive temperature, the chromosomes and plasmid almost always missegregate in tandem. Our results suggest that, after DNA replication, plasmid distribution to the daughter cells occurs in the form of specific DNA-protein aggregates. They further indicate that the plasmid partitioning mechanism may exploit at least some of the components of the cellular machinery required for chromosomal segregation.","https://rupress.org/jcb/article-pdf/149/3/553/1858603/9911076.pdf",""

Birth weight distributions of infants included 15 infants at 401 to 500 g; 94 at 501 to 600 g; 208 at 601 to 700 g; 237 at 701 to 800 g; 290 at 801 to 900 g; and 307 at 901 to 1000 g. Twenty-five percent of the children had an abnormal neurologic examination, 37% had a Bayley II Mental Developmental Index &lt;70, 29% had a Psychomotor Developmental Index &lt;70, 9% had vision impairment, and 11% had hearing impairment. Neurologic, developmental, neurosensory, and functional morbidities increased with decreasing birth weight. Factors significantly associated with increased neurodevelopmental morbidity included chronic lung disease, grades 3 to 4 intraventricular hemorrhage/periventricular leukomalacia, steroids for chronic lung disease, necrotizing enterocolitis, and male gender. Factors significantly associated with decreased morbidity included increased birth weight, female gender, higher maternal education, and white race. Conclusion.: ELBW infants are at significant risk of neurologic abnormalities, developmental delays, and functional delays at 18 to 22 months' corrected age.","https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-pdf/105/6/1216/979892/pe060001216p.pdf",""

Prior to spectral analysis, the rms level is calculated for successive short segments of the waveform and only the weakest 25% of the segments are retained for the spectral analysis [the quietest 150 when using 16k-point fast Fourier transforms (FFTs)]. The resulting initial spectrum is scanned for peaks (potential SOAEs) which are then deleted from the spectrum. New values are estimated for the deleted values using linear extrapolations from frequency ranges on either side of the deleted values. The end result is a smoothed spectrum devoid of all local peaks. The initial spectrum is then compared peak-by-peak with the smoothed spectrum, and those peaks having differences that exceed an objectively determined decision criterion are identified as likely SOAEs. The effects of varying some of the important parameter values of the algorithm are described, and the sensitivity of the procedure is evaluated by measuring the detection rate for a Lorentzian peak of known amplitude added to a spectrum otherwise devoid of SOAEs.","https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article-pdf/108/3/1105/7440782/1105_1_online.pdf",""

A 1955 study stated that in an emergency situation “it is suspected that drivers apply their brakes as hard as possible.” This idea differs from a 1984 report that states drivers will “modulate”their braking to maintain directional control. Thus, additional information is needed about driver braking performance when an unexpected object is in the roadway. In this research driver braking distances and decelerations to both unexpected and anticipated stops were measured. The study design allowed for differences in vehicle handling and driver capabilities associated with antilock braking systems (ABS), wet and dry pavement conditions, and the effects of roadway geometry. Vehicle speeds, braking distances, and deceleration profiles were determined for each braking maneuver. The research results show that ABS result in shorter braking distances by as much as 30 m at 90 km/h. These differences were most noticeable on wet pavements where ABS resulted in better control and shorter braking distances. Braking distances on horizontal curves were slightly longer than on tangent sections; however, they were not large enough to be of practical significance. Maximum deceleration during braking is independent of initial velocity, at least in the range of speeds tested. Differences were noted in individual driver performance in terms of maximum deceleration. Although maximum deceleration was equal to the pavement’s coefficient of friction for some drivers, the average maximum deceleration was about 75 percent of that level. Overall, drivers generated maximum decelerations from 6.9 to 9.1 m/s","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/1701-02",""
