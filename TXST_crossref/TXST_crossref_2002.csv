This may indicate a larger population of individuals with ASD, and may also be the result of better diagnostic definitions and procedures. Early accurate diagnosis is particularly important for children with ASD because of the documented benefits of early educational interventions. One very important component of an ASD screening and diagnostic process is a developmental history. Not only can this type of information assist with diagnosis, but the process of interviewing parents and primary caretakers can provide opportunities for establishing a working alliance with the family, inform further assessment decisions, and facilitate treatment and intervention for coexisting and comorbid disorders. Both structured and semi-structured formats are available for obtaining developmental histories. Personnel who are assigned to obtain developmental histories need strong interviewing skills and extensive knowledge about the diagnostic indicators of ASD.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/073724770202700104",""

These measurements have been made in aqueous solutions ranging in pH from 2.2 to 8.2 in the absence of chemical or mechanical dissolution of the surface oxide. Friction is observed to vary with solution pH, and the specific manner in which interfacial friction depends on pH is influenced by the composition of the interface. The maximum friction force of the tungsten/silicon nitride system occurs at a pH of 4.7. The tungsten/alumina system has a maximum in the frictional force at a pH of 6.6. Frictional variations in these systems are related to pH-mediated changes in the electrostatic interaction between the probe tip and the sample. The pH dependence of the electrostatic interaction is determined by the relative isoelectric points of the contacting surfaces. These nanometer-scale measurements demonstrate a fundamental pathway by which variations in the frictional properties of an interface are introduced by properties of the surrounding liquid environment.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-pdf/20/2/575/8204970/575_1_online.pdf",""

In this article, the authors review relevant Rorschach literature, address the importance of incorporating Rorschach data into the assessment process, and discuss how Rorschach data fit into a thorough assessment that includes historical, clinical, dispositional, and contextual information.

In experiment 1, the effect of spectral “holes” on vowel and consonant recognition was evaluated using speech processed through six frequency bands, and synthesized as a sum of sine waves. Results showed a modest decrease in vowel and consonant recognition performance when a single hole was introduced in the low- and high-frequency regions of the spectrum, respectively. When two spectral holes were introduced, vowel recognition was sensitive to the location of the holes, while consonant recognition remained constant around 70% correct, even when the middle- and high-frequency speech information was missing. The data from experiment 1 were used in experiment 2 to derive frequency-importance functions based on a least-squares approach. The shapes of the frequency-importance functions were found to be different for consonants and vowels in agreement with the notion that different cues are used by listeners to identify consonants and vowels. For vowels, there was unequal weighting across the various channels, while for consonants the frequency-importance function was relatively flat, suggesting that all bands contributed equally to consonant identification.","https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article-pdf/112/3/1102/8091042/1102_1_online.pdf",""

This widespread use of heating is driven primarily by the availability of new technology, not by a detailed understanding of the biothermomechanics. Without basic quantification of the underlying physical and chemical processes in terms of parameters that can be controlled clinically, identification of preferred interventions will continue to be based primarily on trial and error, thus necessitating large clinical studies and years of accumulative experience. Perusal of the literature reveals that much has been learned over the past century about the response of cells, proteins, and tissues to supra-physiologic temperatures; yet, the associated findings are reported in diverse journals and the underlying basic processes remain unidentified.

This study presents a model of differential diagnosis of attentional problems and RD that differs from these conventional approaches. The new diagnostic procedure uses intraindividual differences seen in the performance of at-risk learners on tasks related to reading that vary in their sensitivity to the sustained attention required for successful performance. The hypothesis is that children with inconsistent attention would perform more poorly on tests that require sustained attention, such as listening comprehension, than on tests that are more tolerant of inattention, such as reading comprehension. Such differences would not be seen in the test scores of children who have only RD, because their performance is determined more by the difficulty level of the reading tests than by the degree of sensitivity of the task to attention. The validity of this new model was evaluated by determining the capability of the differences seen in the scores of tests that differ in their sensitivity to sustained attention to predict the degree of inconsistency in sustained attention as measured by a continuous performance test. The data obtained from 39 children who are at risk for RD suggest that this is a viable model.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/00222194020350050301",""

Resistance of plant pathogens to oxytetracycline is rare, but the emergence of streptomycin-resistant strains of Erwinia amylovora, Pseudomonas spp., and Xanthomonas campestris has impeded the control of several important diseases. A fraction of streptomycin-resistance genes in plant-associated bacteria are similar to those found in bacteria isolated from humans, animals, and soil, and are associated with transfer-proficient elements. However, the most common vehicles of streptomycin-resistance genes in human and plant pathogens are genetically distinct. Nonetheless, the role of antibiotic use on plants in the antibiotic-resistance crisis in human medicine is the subject of debate.","https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.phyto.40.120301.093927",""

Self-efficacy and outcome expectancies were lower in older adults with GAD relative to published data from younger and older community samples. Both the SES and LOT demonstrated adequate internal consistency. Confirmatory factor analysis provided evidence for optimism and pessimism factors within the LOT, and exploratory factor analysis of the SES suggested three factors that overlap with previous findings. Overall, the data support the potential utility of these instruments in late-life GAD and set the stage for future investigations of generalized self-efficacy expectancies and outcome expectancies (or optimism) as they relate to the prediction of affect and behavior in this group.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1073191102009001009",""

The new paradigm conceptualizes vocational issues as an integral part of theory, research, practice, and teaching of counseling psychology. Vocational issues should not over shadow other issues but should be an integrated part of what counseling psychologists do. The articles in this major contribution take steps toward this new paradigm by addressing teaching issues in counseling psychology training programs. If the new paradigm is to be adopted by all counseling psychologists, they must begin in their training programs. These articles give suggestions for how to begin the paradigm shift in this setting, discussing implications for the science and practice of counseling psychology beyond the training programs.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/001100002237755",""

A prominent feature of this disease is the accumulation of enlarged lysosome-related granules in a variety of cells. The genome of Dictyostelium discoideumcontains six genes encoding proteins that are related to LYST/Beige in amino acid sequence, and disruption of one of these genes,lvsA (large volumesphere), results in profound defects in cytokinesis. To better understand the function of this family of proteins in membrane trafficking, we have analyzed mutants disrupted in lvsA, lvsB, lvsC, lvsD, lvsE, and lvsF. Of all these, onlylvsA and lvsB mutants displayed interesting phenotypes in our assays. lvsA-null cells exhibited defects in phagocytosis and contained abnormal looking contractile vacuole membranes. Loss of LvsB, theDictyostelium protein most similar to LYST/Beige, resulted in the formation of enlarged vesicles that by multiple criteria appeared to be acidic lysosomes. The rates of endocytosis, phagocytosis, and fluid phase exocytosis were normal inlvsB-null cells. Also, the rates of processing and the efficiency of targeting of lysosomal α-mannosidase were normal, although lvsB mutants inefficiently retained α-mannosidase, as well as two other lysosomal cysteine proteinases. Finally, results of pulse-chase experiments indicated that an increase in fusion rates accounted for the enlarged lysosomes inlvsB-null cells, suggesting that LvsB acts as a negative regulator of fusion. Our results support the notion that LvsB/LYST/Beige function in a similar manner to regulate lysosome biogenesis.","",""

Nucleation of crystalline phases from the amorphous phase of La0.5Sr0.5CoO3 was found to start at a temperature of 325 °C. It is very interesting to note that the crystallization completes within a very narrow temperature range of 390–420 °C, and recrystallization occurs at 560 °C. In addition, electron–phonon, electron–grain boundary, and electron–defect interactions, as well as oxygen contents were found to be important factors in various temperature regions during the resistance measurement. The metallic phase La0.5Sr0.5CoO3 films can only be obtained if the films were directly heated to higher than 750 °C. The sequence and knowledge of phase transitions observed for La0.5Sr0.5CoO3 are expected to be ubiquitous for perovskite oxide compounds in general.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article-pdf/80/23/4333/18567455/4333_1_online.pdf",""

The authors begin by reviewing popular writings on gender and family life by contemporary conservative Protestants, focusing on the competing discourses of traditionalist and egalitarian evangelicals. Then, the authors analyze data on a large U.S. sample of married couples from Wave 1 of the National Survey of Families and Households to compare conservative Protestant housework patterns with those among nonevangelical couples. Conservative Protestant wives perform more housework overall and spend more time doing “female-typed” labor than their nonevangelical peers. These differences are then traced to religious variations in spousal and household resources and also to a distinctive evangelical gender ideology. Interestingly, few religious differences in men's housework patterns are observed. Implications of these findings are discussed and several promising directions for future research identified.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/019251302237299",""

Although there is much empirical evidence about factors underlying EDI adoption and implementation, there is little information from the perspective of the end user. The vast majority of what we know about EDI success (or failure) is based on the EDI manager’s or IT perspective. However, there is evidence that suggests if users are not satisfied with a system, they will not use it. Thus, a study of user satisfaction with EDI can provide firms seeking to better leverage their EDI investment with a different and useful perspective on factors that underlie EDI. Two findings indicate that the greater the perceived benefits of EDI, the greater the user satisfaction; and the more compatible EDI is with existing organizational practices and systems, the more satisfied the users are with the system. Although EDI managers may have suspected this was true, empirical support of heretofore largely anecdotal evidence has several implications for successfully managing EDI adoption and integration. These implications hold not only for the adopting firm, but also for firms that may require, or are considering requiring, trading partners to implement EDI. Finally, implications for future EDI research are discussed.","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=4586",""

Government and research sources detail the development and use of parental leave.

These parents’ data are compared to findings from previous studies in both nations, especially Linda Haas’ 1986 study of parental leave in Sweden.

The purpose of this article is to further develop the foundations that were introduced in Part 1 by using the authors’ own works to illustrate how to develop a new scale and test its psychometric properties. Decision-making strategies and standards for how to interpret scale psychometrics are provided.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/104973102237474",""

BecauseTCH4 encodes a xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase, this change in expression may reflect a recruitment of cell wall-modifying activity in response to environmental stress and growth. How diverse stimuli lead to the common response of TCH4 expression regulation is not known. Here, we show that induction of expression by the diverse stimuli of touch, darkness, cold, heat, and brassinosteroids (BRs) is conferred to reporter genes by the same 102-bp 5′-untranscribed TCH4region; this result is consistent with the idea that shared regulatory elements are employed by diverse stimuli. Distal regions influence magnitude and kinetics of expression and likely harbor regulatory elements that are redundant with those located more proximal to the transcriptional start site. Substitution of the proximal regulatory region sequences in the context of distal elements does not disrupt inducible expression. TCH4 expression induction is transcriptional, at least in part because 5′-untranscribed sequences are sufficient to confer this regulation. However, 5′-untranslated sequences are necessary and sufficient to confer the marked transience of TCH4 expression, most likely through an effect on mRNA stability. Perception of BR is not necessary forTCH4::GUS induction by environmental stimuli because regulation is intact in the BR-insensitive mutant,bri1-2. The full response to auxin, however, requires the functioning of BRI1. Developmental expression ofTCH4 is unlikely to be meditated by BR becauseTCH4::GUS is expressed in BR perception and biosynthetic mutants bri1-2 and det2-1, respectively.","http://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-pdf/130/2/770/38690843/plphys_v130_2_770.pdf",""

First, were reform-induced changes in district resources capitalized into housing values? Second, did the equalization of resources across districts lead to a convergence in school district housing price premiums? Third, and perhaps most importantly, if so, was the convergence in school district housing price premiums the result of a leveling-up or a leveling-down of school district quality? Our results indicate that the answers to the first two questions are both yes – reform-induced changes in spending per pupil were capitalized into housing values and resource equalization has led to a convergence in housing values. Perhaps most importantly, however, our results indicate that the convergence in school district housing price premiums was the result of a leveling-down of school district quality.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/152397210200200401",""

The thickness of a SiO2-like, low-dielectric constant layer at the silicon interface was found to depend on the oxygen partial pressure during annealing. At oxygen partial pressures of about 10−4 torr the interfacial silicon oxide thickness increased through oxygen diffusion through the ZrO2 layer and silicon consumption at the interface. At oxygen partial pressures in the range of approximately 10−5 torr, only a thin (1 nm) interfacial silicon oxide layer was present, as required for low-equivalent oxide thicknesses of gate stacks incorporating alternative oxides. Further reduction of the oxygen partial pressures (about 10−7 torr) during annealing resulted in zirconium silicide formation at the interface. ZrO2 films annealed at the optimal partial pressure for a thin interfacial oxide were found to crystallize and contain no silicon.

The authors first establish the distinctiveness of technological opportunism from related constructs, such as organizational innovativeness, and show that it offers a significantly better explanation of technology adoption than existing constructs do. In a follow-up survey of senior managers, the authors investigate the antecedents of technological opportunism and find that organizations can develop technological opportunism by taking specific actions such as focusing on the future, by having top management advocate new technologies, and by becoming more of an adhocracy culture and less of a hierarchy culture. The proposed technological opportunism construct can inform theory development on the relative emphasis on internal (research and development) versus external (buying, licensing) development of technologies and the complementarities in technology orientation and market orientation in the firm. The results can be used by managers who seek to develop the technological opportunism capability of their firms and by those in technology vendor firms who seek to develop segmentation strategies based on the technological opportunism capabilities of their customer firms.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1509/jmkg.66.3.47.18508",""

On the continental shelf, unconformity WL2 marks the start of shelf progradation, which is interpreted to correspond with the onset of glacial conditions in this segment of the east Antarctic margin. Unusually large (i.e. up to 900 m relief and 18 km between levee crests) channel-levee deposits, and high relief (up to 490 m) mounded contourite-style deposits develop above unconformity WLlb. Unconformity WLlb overlies unconformity WL2 and is interpreted to have formed under a fully continental glacial regime where ice streams reached the palaeo-continental shelf edge. Based on an analysis of multichannel seismic profiles and sediment cores, we differentiate three phases in the development of the sedimentary unit between WLlb and the present seafloor. From older to younger these are: Phase 1, dominated by turbidite deposition; Phase 2, dominated by turbidite and contourite deposition with significant mound building; and Phase 3, dominated by turbidite and contourite deposition without active mound building. We hypothesize that building of the mounds during Phase 2 corresponded with times of expansion of the Antarctic ice-sheet when vast amounts of sediment were eroded from the continent and continental shelf. The large amount of unsorted glacial sediment supplied to the outer shelf apparently travelled down the slope canyons and rise channels as turbidity current flows to feed the usually large continental rise channel-levee complexes. The suspended fines of the turbidity flows were then entrained in a palaeo-nepheloid layer and carried by the westward flowing palaeo-contour currents until their deposition in the mounds. During Phase 3, sediment supply to the continental rise, although important in volume and capable of turbidite and contour-current deposition, was insufficient to support further building of the mounds. We believe the decrease in sediment supply to the continental rise from Phase 2 to Phase 3 could be the result of a change on sediment depocentres, with most of the sediment supplied to the margin during Phase 3 being trapped on the continental shelf. We believe that ultimately these changes are related to the stage of glacial evolution of the continent.","https://www.lyellcollection.org/doi/pdf/10.1144/GSL.MEM.2002.022.01.26",""

The patient experienced multiple episodes of infection, and he was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus at age 9 years. The disease progressed to WHO class III mild lupus nephritis and to fatal CNS vasculitis at age 23 years. Immunochemical experiments showed that the patient and his sibling had complete absence of C4A and C4B proteins and were negative for the Rodgers and Chido blood group Ags. Segregation and definitive RFLP analyses demonstrated that the patient and his sibling inherited two identical haplotypes, HLA A2 B12 DR6, each of which carries a defective long C4A gene and a defective short C4B gene. PCR and DNA sequencing revealed that the mutant C4A contained a 2-bp insertion in exon 29 at the sequence for codon 1213. The identical mutation was absent in the mutant C4B. The C4B mutant gene was selectively amplified by long range PCR, and its 41 exons were completely sequenced. The C4B mutant had a novel single C nucleotide deletion at the sequence for codon 522 in exon 13, leading to frame-shift mutation and premature termination. Thus, a multiplex PCR is designed by which known mutations in C4A and C4B can be elucidated conveniently. Among the 28 individuals reported with complete C4 deficiency, 75–96% of the subjects (dependent on the inclusion criteria) were afflicted with autoimmune or immune complex disorders. Hence, complete C4 deficiency is one of the most penetrant genetic risk factors for human systemic lupus erythematosus.","https://journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article-pdf/169/3/1570/1154938/1570.pdf",""

In the process, he implicitly locates the distinction between sacred and secular texts in the formal aspects of the language. This paper challenges Kugel’s main assumptions. First, the premise that poetry must be metrical is controversial, not given, in the history of literary criticism. Second, the formal properties of language do not prove anything about the significance attributed to the forms. I argue that the categories of ‘literature’ and ‘scripture’ cannot be reduced to the presence or absence of formal qualities. The distinction between sacred and secular texts requires consideration of the relation a community of readers takes toward a text. Future discussions of biblical poetry should incorporate relational issues, not just formal ones.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/030908920202700103",""

However, the exchangeable knowledge of the project cost and project delivery time associated with the construction of semiconductor facilities nationwide is still in the preliminary stage. One major hindrance to the exchangeable knowledge of the project cost and delivery time is the lack of standard definitions to serve as a base for an industry-wide comparison that will allow owners, designers, engineers, and constructors to make decisions at a very early stage of the projects.

Third, perceiving strategies for speech are inherently flexible in terms of the mapping between signal frequencies (i.e., the locations of the formants) and phonetic identity.","http://pubs.asha.org/doi/pdf/10.1044/1059-0889%282002/014%29",""

We used whole-terminal capacitance measurements to examine the effect of hydrostatic pressure on compensatory endocytosis in single synaptic terminals of retinal bipolar neurons. We report that a small increase in hydrostatic pressure reversibly inhibits compensatory endocytosis. Elevation in hydrostatic pressure does not block all membrane retrieval, however. A small, fast component of endocytosis persists, while a slower component is inhibited. When the hydrostatic pressure is then stepped back to a near-neutral setting, an even slower form of endocytosis is observed that restores the resting membrane capacitance to baseline. Thus even when endocytosis is temporally uncoupled from calcium entry and exocytosis, it can still be compensatory, indicating that presynaptic surface area is highly regulated. Our results suggest that at least two distinct mechanisms of membrane retrieval contribute to compensatory endocytosis. Given its dramatic inhibitory effect on membrane retrieval, we suggest that hydrostatic pressure be carefully controlled when studying endocytosis in the whole cell recording configuration.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jn.00267.2002",""

CASE SUMMARY:: A 41-year-old white man suddenly developed agranulocytosis after 89 months of nearly continuous clozapine therapy. During this time, which included the addition of risperidone to the treatment regimen, his white blood cell (WBC) and granulocyte counts remained stable. One week after having stable hematologic counts, the patient suddenly developed agranulocytosis. WBC and granulocyte counts returned to baseline shortly after discontinuation of all medications and administration of sargramostim. DISCUSSION:: The main factor limiting the use of clozapine as a first-line agent in mentally ill patients is the risk of agranulocytosis. Although the greatest risk of developing this adverse reaction is during the initial 6-month exposure, clozapine-induced agranulocytosis continues to pose a risk after years of exposure. Current product labeling requires weekly WBC and granulocyte monitoring for the first 6 months of treatment with clozapine, which may be decreased to biweekly monitoring after 6 months. Based on the sudden and late onset of agranulocytosis in our patient, clinicians may consider opting for weekly monitoring of hematologic function for patients on long-term clozapine therapy. The likelihood that clozapine was the cause of the agranulocytosis was rated possible according to the Naranjo probability scale. CONCLUSIONS:: Clinicians must remain vigilant to trends in WBC and granulocyte counts and may wish to consider weekly hematologic monitoring regardless of duration of clozapine therapy. Patient and treatment system compliance with the registries' protocol regarding WBC monitoring is instrumental in reducing morbidity and mortality rates associated with clozapine use.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1345/aph.1A417",""

Mononuclear cells (osteoclast precursors) must be recruited into the dental follicle prior to the onset of eruption. These cells, in turn, fuse to form osteoclasts that resorb alveolar bone, forming an eruption pathway for the tooth to exit its bony crypt. Some of the molecules possibly involved in the signaling cascades of eruption have been proposed in studies from null mice, osteopetrotic rodents, injections of putative eruption molecules, and cultured dental follicle cells. In particular, recruitment of the mononuclear cells to the follicle may require colony-stimulating factor-one (CSF-1) and/or monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1). Osteoclastogenesis is needed for the bone resorption and may involve inhibition of osteoprotegerin transcription and synthesis in the follicle, as well as enhancement of receptor activator of NFκB ligand (RANKL), in the adjacent alveolar bone and/or in the follicle. Paracrine signaling by parathyroid-hormone-related protein and interleukin -1α, produced in the stellate reticulum adjacent to the follicle, may also play a role in regulating eruption. Osteoblasts might also influence the process of eruption, the most important physiologic role likely being at the eruptive site, in the formation of osteoclasts through signaling via the RANKL/OPG pathway. Evidence thus far supports a role for an osteoblast-specific transcription factor, Cbfa1 (Runx2), in molecular events that regulate tooth eruption. Cbfa1 is also expressed at high levels by the dental follicle cells. This review concludes with a discussion of the several human conditions that result in a failure of or delay in tooth eruption.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/154411130201300403",""

The results indicate that the earnings multiple applied to positive unexpected earnings is significantly greater than for negative unexpected earnings. In addition, we find that after controlling for the magnitude of the forecast error and bad news preannouncements, the market penalty for missing forecasts is significantly greater in absolute terms than the response to beating forecasts. We document evidence that, while the market recognizes and partially discounts the systematic component of positive analysts' forecast errors, a higher multiple is attached to the unsystematic component of unexpected earnings of firms that consistently beat analysts' forecasts.

An estimated 150 bison died of the syndrome between January 1998 and December 1999. The syndrome was identified as malignant catarrhal fever (MCF), primarily the alimentary form. Clinical onset was acute, and most affected bison died within 1–3 days; none recovered. Consistent lesions were hemorrhagic cystitis, ulcerative enterotyphlocolitis, and arteritis-phlebitis. Vasculitis was milder and more localized than that in cattle with MCF, and in contrast to the situation in cattle, lymphadenomegaly was minimal. Virtually all affected bison examined were positive for ovine herpesvirus 2 (OvHV-2) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. A retrospective study of archived tissues established that MCF occurred in the yard as early as 1993. A prospective study was undertaken to establish the importance of MCF relative to other fatal diseases at the feedlot. The fate of a group of 300 healthy male bison in a consignment of 1,101 animals was followed for up to 7 months to slaughter. At entry, 23% (71/300) of bison were seropositive for MCF viruses, and 11% (8/71) of these seropositive bison were PCR positive for OvHV-2. Forty seronegative bison were selected at random from the group, and all were PCR negative for OvHV-2. There was no change in seroprevalence in the group during the investigation. The minimum infection rate for MCF virus was 36.3% (93/256). Twenty-two (7.3%) of the 300 bison in the feedlot died. Of these, 15 had MCF, 4 had acute or chronic pneumonia, and 3 were unexamined.

Twenty-eight subjects from two age groups (young and old) walked around a circular track at a comfortable pace wearing a safety harness. Slippery floor surface was automatically placed on the walking track over force platforms at “unexpected” random time intervals utilizing remote controlled floor changer. Synchronized kinetic and kinematic measures were obtained on both slippery and non-slippery floor surfaces. The results indicated that older subjects step length was significantly shorter, and transitional acceleration of the whole body center-of-mass (COM) was significantly slower than their younger counterparts. Older subjects initial friction demand as measured by required coefficient friction (RCOF) was not significantly different than their younger counterparts. Additionally, older subjects slipped longer and faster than younger subjects. Bivariate correlation analyses suggested that transitional acceleration of the whole body COM was significantly related to friction demand characteristic (e.g., RCOF). These findings suggest that gait changes associated with aging (especially slower transition of the whole body COM) may affect initiation of slip-induced falls among older adults.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/154193120204601338",""

It is common for compressional‐wave velocities to increase by a factor of four or more where shallow, unconsolidated sediments change from a dry or partially water‐saturated regime to full saturation. While this degree of velocity contrast is rare in conventional seismology, it is a common scenario in shallow environments and leads to significant problems when trying to record and interpret reflections within about the first 30 m below the water table. The problem is compounded in shallow reflection studies where problems primarily associated with surface‐related noise limit the range of offsets we can use to record reflected energy. For offset‐to‐depth ratios typically required to record reflections originating in this zone, the assumptions of NMO velocity analysis are violated, leading to very large errors in depth and layer thickness estimates if the Dix equation is assumed valid. For a broad range of velocity profiles, saturated layer thickness will be overestimated by a minimum of 10% if the boundary of interest is <30 m below the water table. The error increases rapidly as the boundary shallows and can be very large (>100%) if the saturated layer is <10 m thick. This degree of error has a significant and negative impact if quantitative interpretations of aquifer geometry are used in aquifer evaluation such as predictive groundwater flow modeling or total resource estimates.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/1.1451362",""

These effects of feeding are substantially reduced with development. The goal of the present investigation was to delineate the basis for the reduced responsiveness to feeding observed in the older animals. In these studies, the content and activity of protein kinases located upstream of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 in signal transduction pathways activated by amino acids, insulin, and insulin-like growth factor I were examined in 7- and 26-day-old pigs that were either fasted overnight or fed porcine milk after an overnight fast. Feeding stimulated phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activity to the same extent in muscle of 7- and 26-day-old pigs, suggesting that PI 3-kinase is not limiting in muscle of older animals. In contrast, protein kinase B (PKB) activity was significantly less in muscle from 26- vs. 7-day-old pigs, regardless of nutritional status, suggesting that its activity is regulated by mechanisms distinct from PI 3-kinase. In part, the reduced PKB responsiveness can be attributed to a developmental decline in PKB content. Likewise, muscle content of the protein kinase termed mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in 26-day-old pigs was <25% of that in 7-day-old animals. Finally, in agreement with our earlier work showing that S6K1 phosphorylation is reduced in older animals, S6K1 activity was stimulated to a lesser extent in 26- compared with 7-day-old pigs. Overall, the results suggest that the blunted protein synthetic response observed in 26- vs. 7-day-old neonatal pigs is due in part to decreased content and/or activity of signaling components downstream of PI 3-kinase, e.g., PKB, mTOR, and S6K1.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpendo.00269.2001",""

Without paclitaxel the cells form defective spindles, undergo aberrant mitoses, fail to complete cell division and eventually die. Analysis of these drug-dependent cells revealed a low amount of microtubule polymer and less tubulin production than wild-type cells. Ribonuclease protection experiments indicated that the decreased tubulin protein was due to decreased tubulin mRNA. Enhancing microtubule assembly by treating the cells with paclitaxel, restored tubulin to levels comparable with those of paclitaxel-treated wild-type cells, which demonstrated that the drug-dependent cells do not have a permanent impairment in their capacity to synthesize tubulin. Paclitaxel-resistant (but not dependent) cells have a smaller reduction in microtubule polymer with little or no decrease in tubulin production, whereas colcemidresistant cells have increased microtubule assembly but also exhibit little or no change in tubulin production. Finally,a mutant cell line producing an unstable β-tubulin protein has normal growth as well as normal synthesis and polymerization of tubulin, despite an approximately 30% decrease in steady state tubulin content.

The increased infrared light absorption inside prostate tumors resulted in acoustic pulses with enhanced peak pressure providing 200%–300% optoacoustic contrast. The transducer array and the optical fiber were wrapped inside a 20-mm diameter thin cylindrical shell filled with ultrasonic gel transparent for infrared radiation. Each acoustic transducer was made of 0.05-mm thick PVDF film with dimensions of 1 mm×12 mm. The frequency bandwidth of transducer array provided 0.3-mm axial in-depth resolution. The lateral resolution is defined by the array length and was estimated as 0.8-mm for 32-element array with 1-mm gap between transducers. Transducer sensitivity of 0.05 mV/Pa allowed the detection of 2-mm tumor located at 50 mm depth. The optoacoustic probe performance was evaluated via the acquisition of two-dimensional optoacoustic images of small absorbing spheres in prostate-tissue phantoms.

In many instances, the highest possible thermal contact conductance is desired. For this reason, soft, high conductivity, metallic coatings are sometimes applied to contacting surfaces (often metallic) to increase thermal contact conductance. O’Callaghan et al. (1981) as well as Antonetti and Yovanovich (1985, 1988) developed theoretical models for thermal contact conductance of metallic coated metals, both of which have proven accurate for flat, rough surfaces. However, these theories often substantially overpredict the conductance of non-flat, rough, metallic coated metals. In the present investigation, a semi-empirical model for flat and non-flat, rough, uncoated metals, previously developed by Lambert and Fletcher (1996), is employed in predicting the conductance of flat and non-flat, rough, metallic coated metals. The models of Antonetti and Yovanovich (1985, 1988) and Lambert and Fletcher (1996) are compared to experimental data from a number of investigations in the literature. This entailed analyzing the results for a number of metallic coating/substrate combinations on surfaces with widely varying flatness and roughness. Both models agree well with experimental results for flat, rough, metallic coated metals. However, the semi-empirical model by Lambert and Fletcher (1996) is more conservative than the theoretical model by Antonetti and Yovanovich (1985, 1988) when compared to the majority of experimental results for non-flat, rough, metallic coated metals.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/heattransfer/article-pdf/124/3/405/6846442/405_1.pdf",""

However, the landscape of sports officials' development itself has changed dramatically over the past decade. New approaches that are more effective have replaced the old traditional methods in many cases. These changes reflect a transition that encompasses philosophical, practical, and implementation elements. New recruiting methods include increased pay, specialized brochures, webpages, online applications, and promotional videos. Extramural assignments, “memorable moments” championship game experiences, assuming booking duties for outside recreational leagues, and mentor programs are among the new techniques implemented for retention/recognition. There is greater computer use to schedule officials, as well as establishing “crews” for the season. The area of training has undergone a significant transformation. Locating outstanding clinicians, access to NIRSA-sponsored educational workshops, the development of “approved” clinicians certification, greater usage of practical application teaching stations, emphasis on small-group instruction, and technological innovations are changing the way sports officials are trained. Sports officials' performance assessment is now done in a variety of ways.

ATP hydrolysis is required for the functional refilling of this vesicle pool. However, it was unclear which steps required ATP hydrolysis: delivery of vesicles to their anatomical release sites or preparation of synaptic vesicles and/or the secretory apparatus for fusion. To address this, we dialyzed single synaptic terminals with ATP or the poorly hydrolyzable analogue ATP-γS and examined the size of the releasable pool, refilling of the releasable pool, and the number of vesicles at anatomical active zones. After minutes of dialysis with ATP-γS, vesicles already in the releasable pool could still be discharged. This pool was not functionally refilled despite the fact that its anatomical correlate, the number of synaptic vesicles tethered to active zone synaptic ribbons, was completely normal. We conclude 1) because the existing releasable pool is stable during prolonged inhibition of ATP hydrolysis, whereas entry into the functional pool is blocked, a vesicle on entering the pool will tend to remain there until it fuses; 2) because the anatomical pool is unaffected by inhibition of ATP hydrolysis, failure to refill the functional pool is not caused by failure of vesicle movement; 3) local vesicle movements important for pool refilling and fusion are independent of conventional ATP-dependent motor proteins; and 4) ATP hydrolysis is required for the biochemical transition of vesicles and/or release sites to fusion-competent status.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jn.2002.88.1.98",""

The cultivars were planted in single rows per bed at 8,12, and 22 seed/m2 with a vacuum precision planter and irrigated with a line source irrigation system that delivered irrigation ranging from none to more than an apparent optimum. Total rainfall between planting and digging was 261 mm in 1992 and 338 mm in 1993. Most of the rainfall occurred early with substantial runoff. GK-7 produced as much as 5400 kg/ha pods and SR produced as much as 4600 kg/ha when irrigation was not limiting in 1992. Yields were lower in 1993. There was no significant yield reduction due to reduced seeding rate for either cultivar at any irrigation level. Generally, a reduced seeding rate resulted in slightly higher pod yields. For GK-7, 8 seed/ m2 outyielded 22 seed/m2 by a maximum of 1129 kg/ha with 673-mm irrigation in 1992 and by 676 kg/ha with 587-mm irrigation in 1993. Pod yield and water use efficiency (WUE) increased with irrigation up to a total of 535 mm in 1992 and 406 mm in 1993. Pod yield increased only slightly and WUE decreased with additional irrigation. No yield or grade advantage of low seeding rate with below-optimum irrigation was evident for either cultivar. When conditions were favorable for plant growth and sufficient time was available for lateformed pods to reach full maturity, plants of these runner cultivars compensated for low plant populations. Planting these and similar varieties at the traditionally high rates may, therefore, not be necessary for optimum pod yield when the growing conditions are similar to those of this study.","http://meridian.allenpress.com/peanut-science/article-pdf/29/1/1/1856604/pnut_29_1_0001.pdf",""

The magnitude of plant growth adjustment of two runner peanut cultivars to reduced seeding rate was studied in 1992 and 1993. A precision vacuum planter was used to plant the cultivars GK-7 and Southern Runner (SR) in single rows per bed at 8, 12, and 22 seed/m2. Total plant dry matter weight (TDM), leaf area (LA), and main stem height, nodes, and branches were measured six times during each season. Vegetative growth adjustment to reduced seeding rate was detected as early as 52 d after planting (DAP) in 1992 and 42 DAP in 1993. Plants fully adjusted to reduced seeding rate when they began forming pods at 70 DAP in 1992 and 75 DAP in 1993. By this stage, individual plants in the 8 seed/m2 treatment accumulated 2 to 2.7 times as much total dry matter (TDM) as plants in the 22 seed/m2, and all seeding treatments within each cultivar accumulated equivalent amounts of TDM on a unit ground area basis. The 8 seed/m2 treatment produced significantly greater TDM/m2 and leaf area index (LAI) than the 22 seed/m2 treatment by the end of both seasons (132 DAP in 1992 and 152 DAP in 1993). The partitioning of dry weight to pods and leaves was also greatest for the 8 seed/m2 seeding treatment. By the end of the season, the 8 seed/ m2 seeding treatment produced as much as 30% more pod dry weight (PDW) per m2 than the 22 seed/m2 treatment. Plants in the 8 seed/m2 seeding were significantly shorter but produced more main stem nodes and branches than the 22 seed/m2 seeding. Under the conditions of this study, plants of these runner cultivars showed the capacity to grow larger and compensate fully for reduced seeding rate before any measurable pod production began. Pod production, therefore, was not reduced and in some situations increased by reducing the seeding rate to as low as 8 seed/m2.","http://meridian.allenpress.com/peanut-science/article-pdf/29/1/8/1856627/pnut_29_1_0002.pdf",""

Here we show that both PAS domains of NPAS2 bind heme as a prosthetic group and that the heme status controls DNA binding in vitro. NPAS2-BMAL1 heterodimers, existing in either the apo (heme-free) or holo (heme-loaded) state, bound DNA avidly under favorably reducing ratios of the reduced and oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate. Low micromolar concentrations of carbon monoxide inhibited the DNA binding activity of holo-NPAS2 but not that of apo-NPAS2. Upon exposure to carbon monoxide, inactive BMAL1 homodimers were formed at the expense of NPAS2-BMAL1 heterodimers. These results indicate that the heterodimerization of NPAS2, and presumably the expression of its target genes, are regulated by a gas through the heme-based sensor described here.","https://www.science.org/doi/pdf/10.1126/science.1078456",""

The largest and most persistent sources are located in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly in a broad “dust belt” that extends from the west coast of North Africa, over the Middle East, Central and South Asia, to China. There is remarkably little large‐scale dust activity outside this region. In particular, the Southern Hemisphere is devoid of major dust activity. Dust sources, regardless of size or strength, can usually be associated with topographical lows located in arid regions with annual rainfall under 200–250 mm. Although the source regions themselves are arid or hyperarid, the action of water is evident from the presence of ephemeral streams, rivers, lakes, and playas. Most major sources have been intermittently flooded through the Quaternary as evidenced by deep alluvial deposits. Many sources are associated with areas where human impacts are well documented, e.g., the Caspian and Aral Seas, Tigris‐Euphrates River Basin, southwestern North America, and the loess lands in China. Nonetheless, the largest and most active sources are located in truly remote areas where there is little or no human activity. Thus, on a global scale, dust mobilization appears to be dominated by natural sources. Dust activity is extremely sensitive to many environmental parameters. The identification of major sources will enable us to focus on critical regions and to characterize emission rates in response to environmental conditions. With such knowledge we will be better able to improve global dust models and to assess the effects of climate change on emissions in the future. It will also facilitate the interpretation of the paleoclimate record based on dust contained in ocean sediments and ice cores.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2000RG000095",""

Double-label immunocytochemistry was performed by using an l-GnRH-III polyclonal antiserum and an LHRH monoclonal antiserum. Immunopositive neurons for l-GnRH-III, m-LHRH, or neurons coexpressing both peptides were detected within the organum vasculosum lamina terminalis (OVLT) region of the preoptic area (POA). Caudal to the OVLT, l-GnRH-III-positive neurons were also observed dorso-medially, above the third ventricle in the medial POA. The m-LHRH neurons were not observed in this area. The lateral POA region contained neurons positive for both peptides along with single-labeled neurons for each peptide. Importantly, neurons that expressed l-GnRH-III, m-LHRH, or both peptides were also detected in the ventral regions of the rostral hypothalamus, dorsolateral to the borders of the supraoptic nuclei. In both of these latter areas, neurons containing l-GnRH-III were slightly dorsal to neurons containing only m-LHRH. The l-GnRH-III perikarya and fibers were eliminated by absorption of the primary antiserum with l-GnRH-III, but not by l-GnRH-I, chicken-GnRH-II, or m-LHRH. These results indicate that, unlike other isoforms of GnRH found in the mammalian brain, l-GnRH-III neurons not only are observed in regions that control follicle-stimulating hormone release but also are colocalized with m-LHRH neurons in areas primarily controlling LH release. These findings suggest an interrelationship between these two peptides in the control of gonadotropin secretion.","https://pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.042699799",""

After pioglitazone treatment, sc fat area at L4–5 (301 ± 44 to 342 ± 44 cm2; P &lt; 0.01) increased, whereas visceral fat area at L4–5 (144 ± 13 to 131 ± 16 cm2; P &lt; 0.05) and the ratio of visceral to sc fat (0.59 ± 0.08 to 0.44 ± 0.06; P &lt; 0.01) decreased. In the postabsorptive state hepatic insulin resistance (basal EGP × basal immunoreactive insulin) correlated positively with visceral fat area (r = 0.55; P &lt; 0.01). The glucose MCRs during the first (r = −0.45; P &lt; 0.05) and second (r = −0.44; P &lt; 0.05) insulin clamp steps were negatively correlated with the visceral fat area. These results demonstrate that a shift of fat distribution from visceral to sc adipose depots after pioglitazone treatment is associated with improvements in hepatic and peripheral tissue sensitivity to insulin.","http://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-pdf/87/6/2784/10406404/jcem2784.pdf",""

However, these results are inconsistent with data from in situ and in vivo heart preparations which show that isoflurane dilates the coronary vasculature. To clarify the direct effects of isoflurane on coronary tone, we measured the response of isolated porcine resistance arterioles (ID, 75 +/- 4.0 microm; range, 41-108 microm) to isoflurane in the presence and absence of adenosine triphosphate-sensitive and Ca2+-activated potassium channel blockers and also after endothelial removal. Methods: Subepicardial arterioles were isolated, cannulated, and pressurized to 45 mmHg without flow in a 37 degrees C vessel chamber filled with MOPS buffer (pH = 7.4). After all vessels developed spontaneous (intrinsic) tone, dose-dependent (0.17-0.84 mm; approximately 0.5-2.5 minimum alveolar concentration) isoflurane-mediated effects on vessel ID were studied in the presence and absence of extraluminal glibenclamide (1 microm; an adenosine triphosphate-sensitive channel blocker) or iberiotoxin (100 nm; a Ca2+-activated potassium channel blocker) or before and after endothelial denudation using the nonionic detergent CHAPS (0.4%). Vessel ID was measured using an inverted microscope and videomicrometer, and vasomotor responses were analyzed by normalizing changes in arteriole ID to the dilation observed after exposure to 10-4 m sodium nitroprusside, which causes maximal dilation. Results: Isoflurane caused dose-dependent dilation of all coronary arterioles. This vasodilation was 6.0 +/- 0.7 microm at an isoflurane concentration of 0.16 mm (approximately 0.5 minimum alveolar concentration) and 25.3 +/- 2.1 microm at 0.75 mm (approximately 2.5 minimum alveolar concentration). These values represent 18.1 +/- 1.7% and 74.1 +/- 3.3%, respectively, of that observed with 10-4 sodium nitroprusside (34 +/- 3 microm). Glibenclamide, but not iberiotoxin, exposure affected arteriolar dilation in response to isoflurane. Glibenclamide caused a downward displacement of the isoflurane dose-response curve, reducing isoflurane-mediated dilation by an average of 36%. Denuded arterioles showed a marked (approximately 70%) reduction in their ability to dilate in response to isoflurane. Conclusions: The authors conclude that isoflurane dilates coronary resistance arterioles in a dose-dependent manner, and that this dilation is partially mediated by adenosine triphosphate-sensitive channels and is highly dependent on the presence of a functioning endothelium.","http://pubs.asahq.org/anesthesiology/article-pdf/96/6/1465/334284/0000542-200206000-00028.pdf",""

We presented 10 calls to each neuron of which 8 were social communication and 2 were echolocation calls. We also measured excitatory response regions: the range of tone burst frequencies that evoked discharges at a fixed intensity. The calls evoked highly selective responses in that IC neurons responded to some calls but not others even though those calls swept through their excitatory response regions. By convolving activity in the response regions with the spectrogram of each call, we evaluated whether responses to tone bursts could predict discharge patterns evoked by species-specific calls. The convolutions often predicted responses to calls that evoked no responses and thus were inaccurate. Blocking inhibition at the IC reduced or eliminated selectivity and greatly improved the predictive accuracy of the convolutions. By comparing the responses evoked by two calls with similar spectra, we show that each call evoked a unique spatiotemporal pattern of activity distributed across and within isofrequency contours and that the disparity in the population response was greatly reduced by blocking inhibition. Thus the inhibition evoked by each call can shape a unique pattern of activity in the IC population and that pattern may be important for both the identification of a particular call and for discriminating it from other calls and other signals.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jn.2002.88.4.1941",""

The method involved extracting low molecular weight or CO2 soluble species in the films by post deposition supercritical CO2 pressurization (SCCO2). We observed a decrease in k value of about 10%–14% in a composite film of organosilicate and a-C:F after SCCO2 treatment at 200 °C for 8 h. The composite films were deposited by PECVD using C4F8 and tetravinyltetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane (TVTMCTS) liquid source and H2 carrier gas at room temperature. As-deposited films were also annealed at 200 °C for 8 h in N2 atmosphere to compare the effect of thermal annealing without SCCO2 treatment. The result shows that there is no change in the k of the films after annealing. Thus, SCCO2 extraction is a good method for reducing the dielectric constant of these PECVD composite films. Supercritical CO2 pressurization of the film deposited using TVTMCTS and H2 only without the addition of C4F8 has no effect on the dielectric properties of the film while SCCO2 treatment of a-C:F samples deposited using C4F8 only dissolved the film. Therefore, in the composite film, we expect that CFx species dissolve during SCCO2 treatment while the organosilicate structure is preserved. Analysis of the Fourier-transform infrared spectra of the samples supports this hypothesis based on the decrease in the C–F absorption intensity after SCCO2 treatment.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article-pdf/81/23/4407/18572496/4407_1_online.pdf",""

The rf power was kept as low as possible to maintain the original ring structure in the films. The as-deposited films were annealed and the dielectric and optical properties were investigated. Identification of the absorption bands in the IR spectra for as-deposited films reveals a broadband around 950–1200 cm−1 arising from the Si–O stretching mode of the ring (1065 cm−1) and chain structure (1000 cm−1), respectively; a band at 750–900 cm−1 due to Si–O bending (790 cm−1); Si–CH3 rocking mode (760 cm−1); a sharp band centered at 1260 cm−1 due to a Si–CH3 bending mode; and a broadband at 2800–3000 cm−1 due to the CH group. A comparison of the IR spectra of the PECVD film and TVTMCTS liquid reveals that vinyl vibrations (Si–CH=CH2) at 960, 1410, and 3030–3095 cm−1 for CH2 and at 1598 cm−1 for C=C present in the liquid were not detected in the CVD films. Hence C=C bonds were broken in the plasma polymerization process. As the pressure and the deposition temperature (TD) increased, the intensity of the Si–O vibration arising from the ring structure increased and decreased, respectively. Thus by tuning the pressure and TD we can control the structure of the film.

B diffusion through grain boundaries after HfSixOy crystallization is proposed to be responsible for the enhanced B diffusivity observed.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article-pdf/81/6/1074/18569174/1074_1_online.pdf",""

Design: Consonants, vowels, and sentences were processed through a four-channel sine-wave simulation of a cochlear implant. In the five experimental conditions, channels 1 and 3 were always output at the correct frequency while channels 2 and 4 were output at frequencies varying from the correct frequency to frequencies 25%, 50%, and 75% lower than appropriate. In a fifth condition (2-of-4 condition), channels 2 and 4 were turned off. Results: Consonant recognition was reduced significantly with a 50% shift in channels 2 and 4. Vowel and sentence recognition were reduced significantly with a 75% shift in channels 2 and 4. For all material performance in the 75% shift condition was better than in the 2-of-4 condition. Conclusions: The perceiving system that underlies speech recognition is relatively tolerant of misplaced frequency information if other information is presented to the correct frequency location.

The mechanism of heat-induced cell death is not clear; however, heat induces a variety of cellular changes. For heat to exert a therapeutic effect, pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or neoplastic tissues) need to be susceptible within temperature ranges that do not exert deleterious effects on normal tissues. Hyperthermia has been used successfully to treat isolated neoplastic lesions of the head and neck, regional tumors such as melanoma of the limb, and is under investigation as either an adjunct to, or therapy for, locally disseminated and systemic diseases. The clinical utility of perfusion hyperthermia has evolved into three approaches -isolated organ or limb, tumorous invasion of a cavity, and systemic or metastatic spread. When whole-body hyperthermic treatment has been tried, it has been induced in the patient by submersion in hot wax or liquid, wrapping in plastic, encasement in a high-flow water perfusion suit, or by extracorporeal perfusion. Our group has developed an extracorporeal method, veno-venous perfusion-induced systemic hyperthermia, that was used first to safely heat swine homogenously to an average body temperature of 43°C for 2 h. More recently, a Phase I clinical trial has been completed in which all patients were safely heated to 42 or 42.5°C for 2 h and survived the 30-day study period.

From “as-implanted” profiles, a large reduction in channeling tail has been observed for the BCl2+ and BBr2+ implants, relative to BF2+ implantation; the depths are reduced by over 200 Å compared to the “equivalent” energy BF2+ implants. After annealing, the 5 keV BCl2+ implanted junctions are shallower than the 5 keV BF2+ junctions by over 150 Å. The 18 keV BBr2+ implants yield junctions as shallow as 100 Å, but suffer from severe doss loss problems—probably caused by enhanced surface scattering and etching for the deceleration mode implant. The 20 keV BBr2+ implants done without deceleration show no dose loss, and result in junction depths identical to those in the 5 keV BF2+ implants. Leakage current measurements indicate an increase of three orders of magnitude for the BCl2+ implanted junctions over BF2+ ones; BBr2+ implanted junctions exhibit lower leakage, comparable to that produced by BF2+. The effect of the different halogen species on B penetration through the gate oxide into the channel region has been studied; the penetration is reduced for BBr2+ implants relative to BF2+ implants.

The asymptotic complexity of our SSA-to-CFG conversion algorithm is where-is the number of instructions in the program.Performing copy folding during the SSA-to-CFG conversion eliminates the need for a separate coalescing phase while simplifying the intermediate code.

The model enables the dynamic instability of sheet rolling to be correlated with work roll stiffiness, rolling speed, inter-stand tension, roll-bite entry and exit thickness, and the sheet force resulted from the interactive action of the work roll with the plastic deformation of the rolled strip. It is found that roll-bit elastic-plastic deformation sheet force is nonlinearly coupled with the rollstack stiffness and also plays a dominant role in affecting rolling instability. In addition, whenever the frequency spectrum of the normal sheet forces containing spectral components that match the fundamental modes of the roll stand, resonance-like beating would occur. This highly linear physical phenomenon, which is accompanied by large vibration amplitudes in the active work rolls, is recognized as chatter. Although many different dynamic modes of instability including mode excitation and beating are induced in response to sheet forces of nonlinear and non-stationary in nature, however, the rolling system never responds chaotically.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2002-32392/2580095/323_1.pdf",""

Summarize the morphological and molecular consequences of exposure to the established perinatal ED, diethylstilbestrol, in the female and male hamster, 3. Present some new, histomorphological insight into the process of neonatal diethylstilbestrol-induced disruption in the hamster uterus, and 4. Introduce recent efforts and future plans to evaluate the potency and mechanism of action of other putative EDs in the hamster experimental system. Taken together, the findings indicate that the hamster represents a unique and sensitive in vivo system to probe the phenomenon of endocrine disruption. The spectrum of candidate endpoints includes developmental toxicity, neoplasia, and more subtle endpoints of reproductive dysfunction.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/153537020222700904",""

These nonlinearities could play an important role in forming and maintaining stimulus selectivity during natural viewing, but only if they operate well within the time frame of a single fixation. To analyze the temporal dynamics of these nonlinearities, we measured the responses of individual neurons, recorded from the primary visual cortex of monkeys and cats, as a function of the contrast of transient stationary gratings that were presented for a brief interval (200 ms). We then examined 1) the temporal response profile (i.e., the post stimulus time histogram) as a function of contrast and 2) the contrast response function throughout the course of the temporal response. We found that the shape and complexity of the temporal response profile varies considerably from cell to cell. However, within a given cell, the shape remains relatively invariant as a function of contrast and appears to be simply scaled and shifted. Stated quantitatively, approximately 95% of the variation in the temporal responses as a function of contrast could be accounted for by scaling and shifting the average poststimulus time histogram. Equivalently, we found that the overall shape of the contrast response function (measured every 2 ms) remains relatively invariant from the onset through the entire temporal response. Further, the contrast-set gain control and the response expansion are fully expressed within the first 10 ms after the onset of the response. Stated quantitatively, the same, scaled Naka-Rushton equation (with the same half-saturation contrast and expansive response exponent) provides a good fit to the contrast response function from the first 10 ms through the last 10 ms of the temporal response. Based upon these measurements, it appears as though the two nonlinear properties, contrast-set gain control and response expansion, are present in full strength, virtually instantaneously, at the onset of the response. This observation suggests that response expansion and contrast-set gain control can influence the performance of visual cortex neurons very early in a single fixation, based on the contrast within that fixation. In the discussion, we consider the implications of the results within the context of 1) slower types of contrast gain control, 2) discrimination performance, 3) drifting steady-state measurements, 4) functional models that incorporate response expansion and contrast normalization, and 5) structural models of the biochemical and biophysical neural mechanisms.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jn.2002.88.2.888",""

In this study we utilized in situ hybridization (ISH) and RT-PCR analyses to examine the expression of neuroglobin in the normoxic and hypoxic murine brain. In the normoxic adult mouse, neuroglobin expression was observed in focal regions of the brain, including the lateral tegmental nuclei, the preoptic nucleus, amygdala, locus coeruleus, and nucleus of the solitary tract.

B diffusion in the tail region was transient, e.g., with an enhancement of 103×equilibrium at 700 °C for the first 60 s. In the near-surface region, a large number of B atoms move toward the native oxide/Si interface with a diffusion rate also transient and similar to that observed in the tail region.

We considered the possibility that this high value results from potassium loss rates that are larger than sodium loss rates. The principal loss processes are the sweeping of hot atoms off the planet by solar radiation acceleration and the capture of metal photoions by the solar wind. We found that radiation acceleration losses are not sufficiently different for sodium and potassium to explain the high ratio. Capture of sodium and potassium photoions by the solar wind is thought to be the major loss process. However, there is a competing process for the ions, which is collision with the surface, followed by neutralization. These atoms can return to the exosphere. The net steady state density of sodium and potassium in the exosphere depends on the relative efficiencies of solar wind capture and surface recycling. We propose that the photoion loss and recycling rates are sufficiently different for sodium and potassium to account for the high ratio. The higher mass of the potassium atom relative to sodium results in a smaller scale height and a larger gyroradius for potassium relative to sodium, which may result in more rapid net loss of potassium.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2000JE001493",""

The results demonstrate the utility of viewing bankruptcy reorganizations as different choice situations, where firms have varying levels of strategic choice, determined largely by their stockpiles of redeployable resources, and face different degrees of environmental constraint. Only firms with relatively high strategic choice or low environmental constraint were found to benefit from refocusing actions. That is, the performance effects of at least one popular remedy, refocusing-type business portfolio initiatives, appear contingent on the choice situation confronting firms under Chapter 11 protection.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/014920630202800507",""

The work reported consists of a review, an extension, and applications of the relevant knowledge base. A nested Penning trap produces a magnetic field, which provides plasma confinement perpendicular to the magnetic field, and an electric field associated with a nested-well potential profile. The nested-well potential profile provides plasma confinement parallel to the magnetic field for oppositely signed plasma species that can have overlapping confinement regions. A configuration is considered in which the electric field is applied in two regions of uniform magnetic field that reside on opposite sides of a magnetic well region. The electric field confines overlapping positron and antiproton plasmas, which thread the magnetic well region. The magnetic well region would serve to trap a fraction of any antihydrogen atoms that are formed. Two different methods are considered for achieving overlap of positron and antiproton plasmas. For each, a set of conditions is predicted for achieving antihydrogen recombination and trapping. Although the study reported specifically considers simultaneous confinement of positron and antiproton plasmas in nested Penning traps, much of the information presented is also relevant to the prospect of merging other pairs of oppositely signed plasmas (e.g., electron and positron plasmas).","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pop/article-pdf/9/8/3289/19159481/3289_1_online.pdf",""

Moench to target and develop multiple molecular cytogenetic probes that would provide extensive coverage for a specific chromosome of sorghum. Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones containing molecular markers mapped across sorghum linkage group A were labeled as probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Signals from single-, dual-, and multiprobe BAC-FISH to spreads of mitotic chromosomes and pachytene bivalents were associated with the largest sorghum chromosome, which bears the nucleolus organizing region (NOR). The order of individual BAC-FISH loci along the chromosome was fully concordant to that of marker loci along the linkage map. In addition, the order of several tightly linked molecular markers was clarified by FISH analysis. The FISH results indicate that markers from the linkage map positions 0.0-81.8 cM reside in the short arm of chromosome 1 whereas markers from 81.8-242.9 cM are located in the long arm of chromosome 1. The centromere and NOR were located in a large heterochromatic region that spans ∼60% of chromosome 1. In contrast, this region represents only 0.7% of the total genetic map distance of this chromosome. Variation in recombination frequency among euchromatic chromosomal regions also was apparent. The integrated data underscore the value of cytological data, because minor errors and uncertainties in linkage maps can involve huge physical regions. The successful development of multiprobe FISH cocktails suggests that it is feasible to develop chromosome-specific “paints” from genomic resources rather than flow sorting or microdissection and that when applied to pachytene chromatin, such cocktails provide an especially powerful framework for mapping. Such a molecular cytogenetic infrastructure would be inherently cross-linked with other genomic tools and thereby establish a cytogenomics system with extensive utility in development and application of genomic resources, cloning, transgene localization, development of plant “chromonomics,” germplasm introgression, and marker-assisted breeding. In combination with previously reported work, the results indicate that a sorghum cytogenomics system would be partially applicable to other gramineous genera.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/161/1/345/42048670/genetics0345.pdf",""

Patients were studied on the 14 ± 5 postburn day, and their mean burn size was 66% ± 18% of total body surface area. Methods were based on the leg arteriovenous balance technique in combination with biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle and infusions of isotopic tracers of amino acids. Net muscle protein breakdown was greater in the patients because of an 83% increase in the rate of muscle protein degradation. The rate of muscle protein synthesis was also increased in the patients but to a lesser extent than protein degradation, i.e. by 50% with the arteriovenous phenylalanine balance technique and by 49% with the direct tracer incorporation method. The absolute values of inward transport of phenylalanine, leucine, and lysine were not significantly different in the two groups. However, the ability of transport systems to take up amino acids from the bloodstream, as assessed by dividing inward transport by amino acid delivery to leg muscle, were 50–63% lower in the patients. In contrast, outward phenylalanine and lysine transport were 40% and 67% greater in the patients than in the controls, respectively. We conclude the primary alteration in muscle protein metabolism is an acceleration of protein breakdown, and the increase in protein synthesis likely is due to increased intracellular amino acid availability as a result of accelerated breakdown. Transmembrane transport in the outward direction is accelerated, presumably to facilitate the export of amino acids from muscle to other tissues. In contrast, transmembrane transport in the inward direction is impaired relatively to the increased delivery of circulating amino acid to skeletal muscle secondary to accelerated blood flow.","http://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-pdf/87/7/3378/9159003/jcem3378.pdf",""

In the past two decades, significant progress has been made in understanding the molecular and cellular pathogenesis of lung cancer. Abnormalities of proto-oncogenes, genetic and epigenetic changes of tumor suppressor genes, the role of angiogenesis in the multistage development of lung cancer, as well as detection of molecular abnormalities in preinvasive respiratory lesions, have recently come into focus. Efforts are ongoing to translate these findings into new clinical strategies for risk assessment, chemoprevention, early diagnosis, treatment selection, and prognosis and to provide new targets and methods of treatment for lung cancer patients. All these strategies should aid in reducing the number of newly diagnosed lung cancer cases and in increasing the survival and quality of life of patients with lung cancer.","https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.physiol.64.081501.155828",""

From below, sample surfaces are brought into this chamber through a Viton-sealed opening and are positioned at the focal plane of the Auger analyzer using a rotatable z-motion manipulator. During electron-induced surface reactions at elevated pressures, the hot filament of the electron source is protected via a small 0.5-mm-diam aperture between the electron source operating at 10−8 Torr and the reaction cell operating at ∼10−4 Torr. In a second configuration, selected after the reaction cell has been pumped out, a larger aperture suitable for collecting Auger electrons is used.

Up to 20 calls were presented to each neuron, of which 18 were social communication and 2 were echolocation calls. We also measured excitatory response regions (ERRs): the range of tone burst frequencies that evoked discharges at a fixed intensity. Neurons were unselective for one or another call in that each neuron responded to any call so long as the call had energy that encroached on its ERR. Additionally, responses were evoked by the same set of calls, and with similar spike counts, when they were presented normally or reversed. By convolving activity in the ERRs with the spectrogram of each call, we showed that responses to tones accurately predicted discharge patterns evoked by species-specific calls. DNLL cells are remarkably homogeneous in that neurons having similar BFs responded to each of the species-specific calls with similar response profiles. The homogeneity was further illustrated by the ability to accurately predict the response profiles of a particular DNLL cell to species-specific calls from the ERR of another similarly tuned DNLL cell. Thus DNLL neurons tuned to the same or similar frequencies responded to species-specific calls with latencies and temporal discharge patterns that were so similar as to be virtually interchangeable. What this suggests is that DNLL responses evoked by complex sounds can be largely explained by a simple summation of the excitation in each neuron's ERR. Finally, superimposing the spectrograms of each call on the responses evoked by that call revealed that the DNLL population response re-creates both the spectral and the temporal features of each signal.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jn.2002.88.4.1955",""

This allows for much lower exposure doses to be used in imaging. Some catalyst mobility is necessary to achieve amplification since the catalyst must move from reaction site to reaction site, but a mobile catalyst can blur the deposited aerial image. Catalyst molecules that are free to move in exposed regions are also free to move into adjacent unexposed regions. Understanding acid catalyst diffusion in photoresist resins is complicated by the constantly changing chemical environment the diffusing catalyst experiences as the resist undergoes chemical reactions. The diffusing catalyst promotes chemical reactions which change the properties of its surrounding resin. In addition, it is possible a transient material state is generated by volatile reaction byproducts and their desorption from the film. In most photoresist systems it is impossible to separate reaction and diffusion effects. This work describes studies of acid diffusion in polymers that are close structural analogs to reactive photoresist resins but do not react with the diffusing acidic catalyst. The purpose of this study into nonreactive polymer is to gain insight into the more complex, reactive systems. In addition, experiments with polymeric photoacid generators are reported. These materials provide added insight into acid transport in photoresist materials.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-pdf/20/6/2946/10998563/2946_1_online.pdf",""

Analysis of full-length cDNAs showed that at least five different Dc3 promoter-binding factors are present in Arabidopsis seeds; one of these, AtDPBF-1, is identical to ABI5. As expected, AtDPBF-1/ABI5 mRNA is inducible by exogenous ABA in seedlings.

The samples are prepared by sputter depositing Hf metal and subsequently oxidizing it. A 600 °C densification anneal is critical to completing Hf oxidation. These spectroscopic data complement electrical testing of metal oxide semiconductor capacitors fabricated with ∼50 Å HfO2 on nitrided and un-nitrided Si(100). Capacitors with interfacial nitride show reduced leakage current by a factor of 100 at a −1 V bias. Concurrently, interfacial nitride increased capacitance 12% at saturation. XPS shows that an interfacial layer composed of nonstoichiometric hafnium silicate (HfSixOy), forms at both the HfO2/Si and HfO2/SiNx interfaces. Differences in the Si 2p and O 1s XP spectra suggest more silicate forms at the un-nitrided interface. HfO2 films on un-nitrided Si show more O 1s and Si 2p photoemission intensity characteristic of HfSixOy. SIMS depth profiles through the buried interface are consistent with interfacial silicate formation, as shown by a HfSiO+ ion signal, that is sandwiched between HfO2 and SiNx. SiNx is suggested to minimize interfacial HfSixOy formation by limiting the amount of Si available to interact with the HfO2 layer.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/91/7/4353/19298144/4353_1_online.pdf",""

Our purpose was to define the role of the PKC signaling pathway in secretion of NT from BON cells, a human pancreatic carcinoid cell line that produces and secretes NT peptide. We demonstrated expression of all 11 PKC isoforms at varying levels in untreated BON cells. Expression of PKC-α, -β2, -δ, and -μ isoforms was most pronounced. Immunofluorescent staining showed PKC-α and -μ expression throughout the cytoplasm and in the membrane. Also, significant fluorescence of PKC-δ was noted in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Treatment with PMA induced translocation of PKC-α, -δ, and -μ from cytosol to membrane. Activation of PKC-α, -δ, and -μ was further confirmed by kinase assays. Addition of PKC-α inhibitor Gö-6976 at a nanomolar concentration, other PKC inhibitors Gö-6983 and GF-109203X, or PKC-δ-specific inhibitor rottlerin significantly inhibited PMA-mediated NT release. Overexpression of either PKC-α or -δ increased PMA-mediated NT secretion compared with control cells. We demonstrated that PMA-mediated NT secretion in BON cells is associated with translocation and activation of PKC-α, -δ, and -μ.

The fundamental mechanism that governs the dissolution of these polymers has been the subject of considerable discussion, and a number of theories have been proposed to explain this behavior. Our research group has presented the critical ionization (CI) dissolution model to explain the dissolution of phenolic polymers in aqueous base. Specifically, the model proposes that a minimum or critical fraction of ionized sites, fcrit, on a given polymer chain must be ionized in order for that chain to dissolve. The main input parameters to this model are the critical fraction of ionized sites, fcrit, and the fraction of ionized surface sites, α. In this work methods are established for measuring these parameters. A quantitative link between the CI model and experiment has been demonstrated for the dissolution rate and surface roughness dependence on polymer molecular weight. Methods for calculating α are discussed, including a new method that considers the formation of an electrostatic double layer at the resist–developer interface.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-pdf/20/2/537/8204990/537_1_online.pdf",""

The present approach derives from recent experiments in which atoms and molecules are prepared by one (or more) coherent laser(s) and probed by another set of lasers. However, generating and using maximally coherent oscillation in macromolecules having an enormous number of degrees of freedom is challenging. In particular, the short dephasing times and rapid internal conversion rates are major obstacles. However, adiabatic fast passage techniques and the ability to generate combs of phase-coherent femtosecond pulses provide tools for the generation and utilization of maximal quantum coherence in large molecules and biopolymers. We call this technique FAST CARS (femtosecond adaptive spectroscopic techniques for coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy), and the present article proposes and analyses ways in which it could be used to rapidly identify preselected molecules in real time.","https://pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.172290899",""

Reduced model equations are obtained by ordering spatial derivatives in terms of rapid variations across the pores in the stack, versus slow variations along the resonator axis. High efficiency is achieved with the solution algorithm because the stability condition for numerical integration of the model equations is connected with resonator length rather than pore diameter. Computation time is reduced accordingly, by several orders of magnitude, without sacrificing spatial resolution. The solution algorithm is described in detail, and the results are verified by comparison with established linear theory.

The highest density, 1.1×1012 cm−2 as measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and 2.1×1012 cm−2 by scanning tunneling microscopy, is achieved by depositing 1.8 monolayer Si on Si3N4 at 600 °C and a disilane pressure of 1.2×10−6 Torr.

Different densities are reported because scanning tunneling microscopy imaged Si nanoparticles of ∼4 nm, beyond the resolution of SEM. At temperatures above 600 °C, parallel thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) during HW-CVD becomes important. Parallel thermal CVD broadens the size distribution of Si nanoparticles and causes coalescence of neighboring nanoparticles, leading to a decrease of nanoparticle density.

The system included an automatic sampling component controlled by a LabVIEW program and a high-throughput fiber coupling component connected to a Fourier transform near-infrared spectrometer. The effectiveness of the system was investigated via noninvasive on-line measurement of glucose absorbance spectra in the cell culture media during T-cell culture. Glucose absorbance spectra were collected in the spectral range of 2.0 to 2.5 μm. Partial least-squares regression was employed to build a successful multivariate calibration model. The standard error of prediction and mean percent error for glucose were 7.7 mg/dL and 1.0%, respectively.

We describe the neurological progression and pain evolution of these patients over the 1-year period after surgery. In addition, our favored method of en bloc tumor resection is illustrated, and the rate of complications, recurrence, and survival in this group of patients is addressed. METHODS: We operated on 26 patients (12 male and 14 female) with low-grade spinal cord ependymomas between 1975 and 2001. The median age at diagnosis was 42 years. Tumors extended into the cervical cord in 13 patients, the thoracic cord in 7 patients, and the conus medullaris in 6 patients. Eleven patients had previous surgery and/or radiation therapy. RESULTS: We achieved a gross total resection in 88% of patients, whereas 8% had a subtotal resection and 4% had a biopsy. Only 1 patient developed a recurrence over a mean follow-up period of 31 months. CONCLUSION: We conclude that radical surgical resection of spinal cord ependymomas can be safely achieved in the majority of patients. A trend toward neurological improvement from a postoperative deficit can be expected between 1 and 3 months after surgery and continues up to 1 year. Postoperative dysesthesias begin to improve within 1 month of surgery and are significantly better by 1 year after surgery. The best predictor of outcome is the preoperative neurological status.","http://academic.oup.com/neurosurgery/article-pdf/51/5/1162/32555749/00006123-200211000-00010.pdf",""

The far-infrared spectra, which are very similar to those previously reported, together with the Raman and dispersed fluorescence (SVLF) spectra of the jet-cooled molecules were used to reassign the ring-puckering and ring-flapping energy levels for the S0 ground state. These were then utilized to calculate a two-dimensional vibrational potential energy surface (PES) which nicely fits all of the assigned puckering and flapping levels. The PES has a barrier of 488 cm−1 as compared to a previously reported value of 1979 cm−1, which was based on a one-dimensional analysis and earlier assignments. The dihedral angle of puckering is ±30°. Fluorescence excitation spectra of jet-cooled indan together with ultraviolet absorption spectra were used to assign the flapping and puckering levels in the S1(π,π*) electronic excited state. The PES for this state has a barrier of 441 cm−1 and the energy minima correspond to puckering angles of ±39°. The flapping frequency and the stiffness of the PES along the flapping coordinate both decrease substantially in the excited state. The barriers to planarity for both states are higher than those for analogous molecules due to the two –CH2–CH2– torsional interactions. Ab initio calculations do a fairly good job of predicting the experimental barriers for indan and related molecules in their S0 and S1 states.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/116/15/6648/19190223/6648_1_online.pdf",""

Beyond ordinary benzenoid molecules, illustrative applications are noted to a diversity of extended species, including: Differently structured edges on semi-infinite graphite; corner structures where edges along different directions meet; conjugated polymer-strip ends; and local defect vacancy structures in extended graphite. The variety of simple resonance-theoretic predictions are compared against a semiempirical unrestricted Hartree–Fock view of some quantitative tight-binding molecular-orbital-theoretic computations.

Ten mildly hypercholesterolemic men, ages 34-58 years old, were selected from the Texas A&M University faculty and staff. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two diets for a 6-week duration followed by a crossover after a 4-week habitual diet washout period. Diets were consumed daily for a 6-week study period. Participants substituted lean beef obtained from Wagyu bullocks or commercial beef for the meat typically consumed. Total cholesterol, apolipoproteins A-I and B, triacylglycerols, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were measured in serum samples collected weekly. Beef type had no effect on any measured variable. There were no significant differences between baseline HDL or LDL cholesterol concentrations after the consumption of the beef test diets. Apolipoprotein A-I, serum glucose, and uric acid concentrations were elevated by the additional dietary beef. Analysis of records of customary diets indicated that one group consumed 160 g of beef daily, whereas the other group consumed only 26 g of beef daily. Therefore, post hoc analyses tested the habitual beef intake x treatment time interaction. LDL cholesterol concentration was markedly higher in the group with low habitual beef Intake (180 vs 144 mg/dl), and HDL cholesterol was slightly higher (44 vs 40 mg/dl; post-test values) than for the group with high habitual beef intake, but there were no habitual intake x time interactions for LDL or HDL cholesterol. Creatinine and blood urea nitrogen concentrations also were greater in the individuals habitually consuming less beef. This study had three important findings: i) a lean beef source enriched with oleic acid was no different from commercial beef in its effect on lipoprotein fractions; ii) neither previous level of beef intake nor baseline LDL cholesterol concentration influenced the serum cholesterol response to added dietary beef. which was negative; and iii) apolipoprotein A-I, but not HDL or LDL cholesterol, was sensitive to the additional dietary beef.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/153537020222700407",""

The hypothesis to be tested in this study is that osteocytes can stimulate and support osteoclast formation and activation. To test this hypothesis, an osteocyte-like cell line called MLO-Y4 and primary murine osteocytes were used in coculture with spleen or marrow cells. MLO-Y4 cells support osteoclast formation in the absence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OD)2D3] or any other exogenous osteotropic factor. These cells alone stimulate osteoclast formation to the same extent or greater than adding 1,25(OH)2D3. Coaddition of 1,25(OH)2D3 with MLO-Y4 cells synergistically increased osteoclast formation. Optimal osteoclast formation and pit formation on dentine was observed with 200–1000 MLO-Y4 cells per 0.75-cm2 well. No osteoclast formation was observed with 2T3, OCT-1, or MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cells (1000 cells/well). Conditioned media from the MLO-Y4 cells had no effect on osteoclast formation, indicating that cell contact is necessary. Serial digestions of 2-week-old mouse calvaria yielded populations of cells that support osteoclast formation when cocultured with 1,25(OH)2D3 and marrow, but the population that remained in the bone particles supported the greatest number of osteoclasts with or without 1,25(OH)2D3. To examine the mechanism whereby these cells support osteoclast formation, the MLO-Y4 cells were compared with a series of osteoblast and stromal cells for expression of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), RANKL, and osteoprotegerin (OPG). MLO-Y4 cells express and secrete large amounts of M-CSF. MLO-Y4 cells express RANKL on their surface and their dendritic processes. The ratio of RANKL to OPG mRNA is greatest in the MLO-Y4 cells compared with the other cell types. RANK-Fc and OPG-Fc blocked the formation of osteoclasts by MLO-Y4 cells. These studies suggest that both RANKL and OPG may play a role in osteocyte signaling, OPG and M-CSF as soluble factors and RANKL as a surface molecule that is functional in osteocytes or along their exposed dendritic processes.","https://academic.oup.com/jbmr/article-pdf/17/11/2068/56468486/5650171120.pdf",""

The present investigation examines the influence of varying levels of complexity of an in-vehicle distracter on driving performance and on the driver's reaction to an emergency event. Results indicated males exhibited greater standard deviation of lane deviation than females, and both low and high levels of distraction complexity resulted in greater lane deviation than no distraction. The theoretical and practical ramifications of the present research are discussed.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/154193120204602212",""

The mating pathway of this fungus has a number of conserved genes, including a MATα-specific pheromone (MFα1). A modified differential display strategy was used to identify a gene encoding the MATa pheromone. The gene, designated MFa1, is 42 amino acids in length and contains a conserved farnesylation motif. MFa1 is present in three linked copies that span a 20-kb fragment of MATa-specific DNA and maps to the MAT-containing chromosome. Transformation studies showed that MFa1 induced filament formation only in MATα cells, demonstrating that MFa1 is functionally conserved. Sequence analysis of the predicted Mfa1 and Mfα1 proteins revealed that, in contrast to other fungi such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the C. neoformans pheromone genes are structurally and functionally conserved. However, unlike the MFα1 gene, which is found in MATα strains of both varieties of C. neoformans, MFa1 is specific for the neoformans variety of C. neoformans.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/160/3/935/42036928/genetics0935.pdf",""

During dissolution, a negative surface charge accumulates at the surface of the photoresist film as acidic sites on the polymer are ionized by the basic developer. This negative surface charge causes a depletion of hydroxide ions in the developer solution immediately adjacent to the film. One effect of this phenomenon is to reduce the dissolution rate relative to rates predicted from the bulk base concentration. The depletion of base at the resist/developer interface has been studied through the application of the Poisson–Boltzmann equation and through Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown that the extent of depletion of hydroxide at the surface of the film is related to the bulk developer concentration and the local geometry of the interface. Interfacial geometry is found to be most influential on the length scale of 1–10 nm. When electrostatic effects are considered in conjunction with the equilibrium of the acid–base reaction, the fractional ionization of the surface of the film is significantly lower than previously calculated. Understanding the relationship between the acid–base equilibrium and electrostatic equilibrium represents an important step in our efforts to understand the fundamental dissolution mechanism of positive tone photoresists.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-pdf/20/6/2913/10997679/2913_1_online.pdf",""

We also examined firm size as a potential moderator of their effects. In addition, we tested whether these response-rate enhancements affected the psychometric quality (acquiescence, self-presentation bias) of the executive survey data. Despite high statistical power(n = 1,200, 1-β≥.95), none of the conventional response-rate enhancement techniques were effective.

This study was performed to quantify the time spent and exposure levels associated with implant preparation, as well as to investigate any improvement in the time or exposure burden due to the introduction of a new loading device. The movements and radiation exposures for two single, highly experienced dosimetrists were monitored for ten conventionally loaded iodine implant cases. These same cases were reloaded with dummy sources using the sleeved system to determine time savings, if any. Two of these ten cases were then loaded with live sources using the sleeved system to determine relative exposure to the loading staff between the two methods. The results were then analyzed to generate per‐seed and per‐needle loading time and exposure burdens. Formulas are presented that may be used to determine the average time to load implants and the resultant staff exposure, both with the conventional technique and with the sleeved method. On the average, it takes an experienced loader 48 min to prepare an implant for the operating room, receiving a hand dose of about 10 mrem and a whole body dose of about 1 mrem. The sleeved system reduced these values by at least half. The time and exposure burden associated with the preparation of iodine loose seed implants has been characterized.

The effect of two feeding patterns on the generation of airborne dust and the total numbers of microorganisms was also examined (four feedlot pens/treatment).

An Andersen biological cascade sampler was employed with different medium and incubation combinations for the capture and identification of bacteria and fungi. The results showed that when bacteria were considered, only nonpathogenic gram-positive organisms were recovered.

Four asymptotic electronic channels are energetically allowed for ClO photodissociation at 235 nm, although the dominant products observed at 235 nm are Cl(2P3/2) and O(1D2). Polarization-dependent time-of-flight profiles indicate that this channel has an anisotropy parameter of β=1.2±0.2. Evidence for O(3PJ) products was detected in coincidence with Cl(2P1/2) fragments, and we estimate that this channel constitutes &lt;3% at this wavelength.

The particle barrier known as the pellicle presents a substantial resistance to mass transfer. In this project, a purge chamber has been devised that can decontaminate the reticle from these species. This work evaluates various purging strategies using polymeric and inorganic pellicle materials to attain acceptable contaminant levels. Results are presented that show the decline in O2 concentration over time within the pellicle space under an external N2 purge. Variables in the experiment include the pellicle material, the allotment of filters on the pellicle frame, and the flow rate of the purge gas. Furthermore, a model of the purging process was developed, which shows good agreement with experimental data.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-pdf/20/5/1954/11133386/1954_1_online.pdf",""

Whole-kidney and glomerular hypertrophy caused by hyperglycemia was associated with specific G1 phase cell-cycle events: early and sustained increase in expression of cyclin D1 and activation of cyclin D1-cdk4 complexes, but no change in expression of cyclin E or cdk2 activity. Overexpression of RB alone likewise caused hypertrophy and increased only cyclin D1-cdk4 activity; these effects were not further augmented by high glucose. Identical observations were made when isolated mesangial cells conditionally overexpressing RB from a tetracycline-repressible system hypertrophied in response to high glucose. A mitogenic signal in the same cell-culture system, in contrast, transiently and sequentially activated both cyclin D1-cdk4 and cyclin E-cdk2. In vivo and in cultured mesangial cells, high glucose resulted in persistent partial phosphorylation of RB, an event catalyzed specifically by cyclin D1-cdk4.

These functions contribute to the pathogenesis of lung inflammation and remodeling as well as the growth and invasiveness of lung neoplasms. In this study, we sought to determine if uPA alters its own expression in lung epithelial cells. Using immunoprecipitation and Western and Northern blotting techniques, we found that uPA treatment enhanced uPA expression in Beas2B lung epithelial cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The induction of uPA expression is mediated through its cell surface receptor uPAR and does not require uPA enzymatic activity. The amino-terminal fragment of uPA, lacking the catalytic domain, is sufficient to induce uPA expression. The serine protease plasmin and the protease inhibitor aprotinin failed to alter uPA-mediated uPA expression, whereas α-thrombin potentiated the response. Pretreatment of Beas2B cells with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, herbimycin, suggests that activation of tyrosine kinase(s) is involved in the uPA-mediated uPA expression. Induction of uPA expression by exposure of lung-derived epithelial cells to uPA is a newly defined pathway by which this protease could influence expression of local fibrinolytic activity and other uPA-dependent cellular responses germane to lung inflammation or neoplasia.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajplung.00395.2001",""

INTERVENTIONS: Computed tomography images were obtained using conventional clinical algorithms involving multiple, 1‐mm‐thick slices through the temporal bone. Three‐dimensional reconstructions were made using General Electric Advantage Windows Navigator software. The virtual endoscopic image‐processing algorithm used selected image intensity threshold levels to visualize internal auditory canal anatomy from an endoscopic perspective. RESULTS: Eleven cases of abnormalities of the internal auditory canal were retrospectively identified. Clinical applications using the virtual endoscopic images are presented. The virtual endoscopic images supported prior clinical decision making in 6 of the 11 cases evaluated. CONCLUSION: This technique shows promise for the diagnosis, surgical planning, and teaching of temporal bone anatomy.

Studies in rodents with lesions of the ventromedial hypothalamus have implicated the VMH in body weight regulation, suggesting that SF-1 KO mice may provide a genetic model of obesity. To prevent death, SF-1 KO mice were rescued with corticosteroid injections, followed by syngeneic adrenal transplants from wild-type (WT) littermates. Corticosterone and ACTH levels in WT and SF-1 KO mice were indistinguishable, documenting restoration of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function. Although weights at earlier ages did not differ significantly from WT littermates, SF-1 KO mice were significantly heavier by 8 wk of age and eventually weighed almost twice as much as WT controls. Obesity in SF-1 KO mice predominantly resulted from decreased activity rather than increased food intake. Leptin was increased markedly, insulin was modestly elevated, and glucose was indistinguishable from WT mice. Although sex steroids in rodents affect weight, ovariectomy did not abolish the weight difference between WT and SF-1 KO mice. These SF-1 KO mice are a genetic model of late-onset obesity that may help elucidate the role of the VMH in weight regulation.","http://academic.oup.com/endo/article-pdf/143/2/607/10368813/endo0607.pdf",""

The physical geometry and imposed thermal and radiative boundary conditions correspond to a unidirectional, hoop-wound cylinder.

We describe here a strategy for developing an alternative treatment based on the human diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor/heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) precursor. Recombinant mature human HB-EGF acts as a soluble receptor analog, binding radioiodinated DT and preventing its binding to the cellular DT receptor/HB-EGF precursor. However, the possibility existed that radioiodinated DT-HB-EGF complexes associate with cells due to the binding of the heparin-binding domain of recombinant HB-EGF to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans. This possibility was confirmed by performing DT binding studies in the presence of heparin. A recombinant truncated HB-EGF (residues 106 to 149), which lacks most of the heparin-binding domain, showed an essentially heparin-independent binding of radioiodinated DT to cells. Furthermore, it was a more effective inhibitor of DT binding than was recombinant mature HB-EGF. Since mature HB-EGF is a known ligand for the EGF receptor and is thus highly mitogenic (tumorigenic), we then changed amino acid residues in the EGF-like domain of the recombinant truncated HB-EGF and demonstrated that this DT receptor analog (I117A/L148A) displayed a low mitogenic effect. The truncated (I117A/L148A) HB-EGF protein retained high DT binding affinity, as confirmed by using surface plasmon resonance. Our results suggest that the truncated (I117A/L148A) HB-EGF protein could be an effective, safe antidote for human diphtheria.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/IAI.70.5.2344-2350.2002",""

Indeed, the production of ROS was significantly higher in cells treated with oleate. Furthermore, the presence of antioxidants and ROS scavengers did not attenuate the induction of apoptosis by palmitate. Variations in the fatty acid-to-albumin ratio from 2:1 to 7:1 had no effect on the absence of ROS production or on the extent of apoptosis. No evidence was found for an increase in oxidative protein modification in palmitate-treated cells. Our results lead us to conclude that oxidative stress does not play a role in palmitate-induced apoptosis.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpheart.00726.2001",""

We describe here a strategy for developing an alternative treatment based on the human diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor/heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) precursor. Recombinant mature human HB-EGF acts as a soluble receptor analog, binding radioiodinated DT and preventing its binding to the cellular DT receptor/HB-EGF precursor. However, the possibility existed that radioiodinated DT-HB-EGF complexes associate with cells due to the binding of the heparin-binding domain of recombinant HB-EGF to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans. This possibility was confirmed by performing DT binding studies in the presence of heparin. A recombinant truncated HB-EGF (residues 106 to 149), which lacks most of the heparin-binding domain, showed an essentially heparin-independent binding of radioiodinated DT to cells. Furthermore, it was a more effective inhibitor of DT binding than was recombinant mature HB-EGF. Since mature HB-EGF is a known ligand for the EGF receptor and is thus highly mitogenic (tumorigenic), we then changed amino acid residues in the EGF-like domain of the recombinant truncated HB-EGF and demonstrated that this DT receptor analog (I117A/L148A) displayed a low mitogenic effect. The truncated (I117A/L148A) HB-EGF protein retained high DT binding affinity, as confirmed by using surface plasmon resonance. Our results suggest that the truncated (I117A/L148A) HB-EGF protein could be an effective, safe antidote for human diphtheria.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/IAI.70.5.2344-2350.2002",""

In this novel approach, 6 ×6 × 0.25 in.3 quartz photomask substrates are coated with a 60 nm indium tin oxide (ITO) charge dissipation layer and directly electron-beam written using a 100 nm film of HSQ. Direct patterning of an oxide relief layer eliminates the problems of critical dimension control associated with both chromium and oxide etches, both required processes of previous template fabrication schemes. Resolution of isolated and semidense lines of 30 nm has been demonstrated on imprinted wafers using this type of template. During this evaluation, a failure of the release layer to provide a durable nonstick surface on ITO was discovered and investigated. This problem was successfully remedied by depositing a 5 nm oxide layer over the patterned ITO/HSQ template.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-pdf/20/6/2896/10999062/2896_1_online.pdf",""

The bulk sample was prepared by a seeded-melt growth process in which a small NdBaCuO seed was used to induce domain growth of YBaCuO. The sample had cubic shape so that its edges coincided with basic crystallographic directions. The measurements were conducted in static and dynamic modes. Under static mode, the angular dependencies of the torque have been obtained in a series of zero field cooled magnetic hysteresis measurements. Between each measurement at a specific angle, the sample was warmed up above critical temperature. Under dynamic mode, the magnetic field was increased up to a certain point and then the sample was turned around its axis continuously. It was found that the static torque was a sinusoidal function of the double angle between the external field and one of basic directions of the crystal structure. It also exhibited prominent anisotropy in relation to the crystal structure of the high-temperature superconductor. The dynamic torque-angle relation is not only a result of the anisotropic structure of the superconductor but also a result of the strong intrinsic pinning of this material.

We previously identified a novel inhibitor of OCL formation that is produced by OCLs (osteoclast inhibitory peptide-1/human Sca [OIP-1/hSca]). OIP-1/hSca is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked membrane protein (16 kDa) that is cleaved from the OCL surface. Immunocytochemical staining further confirmed the expression of OIP-1/hSca in OCL formed in mouse bone marrow cultures. However, the structure/function mechanisms responsible for the inhibitory effects of OIP-1/hSca on OCL formation are unknown. Therefore, we expressed deletion mutants of OIP-1 in 293 cells and tested their effects on OCL formation. These studies indicated that the carboxy-terminal peptide (c-peptide) region is critical for OIP-1/hSca activity. A 33 amino acid OIP-1 c-peptide (10-100 ng/ml) significantly inhibited 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] induced OCL formation and pit formation capacity of OCL on dentine slices in human bone marrow cultures. Furthermore, the c-peptide (10-100 ng/ml) significantly inhibited early human OCL precursor (granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit [GM-CFU]) colony formation in methylcellulose cultures. The polyclonal antibody against the OIP-1 c-peptide neutralized the inhibitory effect of OIP-1 c-peptide on OCL formation in mouse bone marrow cultures in vitro. These results show that the OIP-1 c-peptide is the functional domain of OIP-1 and that availability of neutralizing antibody specific to the OIP-1 c-peptide should provide important mechanistic insights into OIP-1/hSca inhibition of osteoclastogenesis in the bone microenvironment.","https://academic.oup.com/jbmr/article-pdf/17/1/111/56470864/5650170113.pdf",""

Six women taking oral contraceptives underwent whole-body cooling during high-hormone (HH) and low-hormone (LH) phases of oral contraceptive use. SkBF was monitored by laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) at sites treated by intradermal injection of yohimbine-propranolol (5 mM and 1 mM; YOPR) to block the effects of norepinephrine (NE) or at saline (Sal) control sites. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was measured with the use of the Penaz method. Cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC = LDF/mean arterial pressure) was expressed as a percentage of baseline. Whole body skin temperature was decreased from 34 to 31°C in HH and LH. In both HH and LH, CVC at Sal-treated sites was reduced during cooling (CVC = 53.1 ± 8.6% and 54.4 ± 4.2%, both P < 0.05). In HH, CVC at YOPR sites was reduced during cooling (78.8 ± 3.6%, P < 0.05). In contrast, CVC at YOPR sites was not reduced significantly during cooling in LH (CVC = 95.9 ± 2.8%, P > 0.05). Across phases, CVC at YOPR sites during cooling was significantly different ( P < 0.05). After cooling, the effects of NE at YOPR sites were completely blocked.

Even though both systems are controlled by traffic signals, they primarily operate independently of one another. The integrated operations of a surface street system and a freeway system were studied with VISSIM, a microscopic simulation model. A traffic network consisting of a surface street and a freeway segment was constructed in VISSIM. The surface street and freeway are connected through a diamond interchange with on-ramps and off-ramps. The objective of the study was to develop an integrated control algorithm for both the diamond interchange signal and the ramp-metering signal. The proposed control algorithm, including an adaptive diamond interchange control and a traffic-responsive ramp-metering control were programmed with VISSIM’s vehicle-actuated programming, which serves as an external control function for the simulation model. Preliminary tests of the proposed control algorithm indicated improved operations for both the surface street system and the freeway system. Traffic operations were significantly improved compared with nonadaptive diamond control and static ramp-metering control. Although similar performance measures were found (with the particular scenarios evaluated) with no-metering control, with the existing traffic-responsive ramp-metering control, and with the proposed traffic-responsive rampmetering control, the proposed control algorithm has more flexibility and may be adapted over a broader range of traffic flow conditions.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/1811-11",""

In a porosity range from 0% to 50%, both the dielectric constant and thermal conductivity decreased with increasing porosity and no significant change was observed at the percolation point where pores became interconnected. In comparison, the stress–temperature slope also decreased with porosity, but as the porosity approached the percolation point, the slope showed a large drop of 40%, indicating a significant degradation of the thermomechanical properties due to percolation of pores. Assuming the coefficients of thermal expansion remain at 17 ppm/°C within the porosity range, the change in the stress–temperature slope corresponds to a decrease of the biaxial modulus from 7 to 5 GPa around the percolation point.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article-pdf/81/22/4180/18572295/4180_1_online.pdf",""

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine which technique provides a faster slide into the base. Study Design: Controlled field study. Methods: A total of 60 players ranging from Little League to college level was analyzed. Each athlete was evaluated three times from a standing start at first base to either a head-first or feet-first touch of second base.

To accomplish this goal, we employed a two-dimensional network of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and a recently developed model of localized ischemia-reperfusion. Washout of the ischemia-like solution resulted in tachyarrhythmic episodes lasting 15–200 s. These episodes were preceded by the appearance of multiple ectopic sources and propagation of ectopic activity along the border of the former ischemic zone. The ectopic sources exhibited a slow rise in diastolic calcium, which disappeared upon return to the original pacing pattern. Border zone propagation of ectopic activity was followed by its escape into the surrounding control network, generating arrhythmias. Together, these observations suggest that upon reperfusion, a distinct layer, which consists of ectopically active, poorly coupled cells, is formed transiently over an injured area. Despite being neighbored by a conductive and excitable tissue, this transient functional layer is capable of sustaining autonomous waves and serving as a special conductive medium through which ectopic activity can propagate before spreading into the surrounding healthy tissue.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpheart.00096.2002",""

To test the hypothesis that α-MSH would afford similar protection in the postischemic small intestine, we analyzed the effects of this peptide on intestinal transit, histology, myeloperoxidase activity, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation after 45 min of superior mesenteric artery occlusion and ≤6 h of reperfusion. Rats subjected to I/R exhibited markedly depressed intestinal transit, histological evidence of severe injury to the ileum, increased myeloperoxidase activity in ileal cytoplasmic extracts, and biphasic activation of NF-κB in ileal nuclear extracts. In contrast, rats treated with α-MSH before I/R exhibited intestinal transit and histological injury scores comparable to those of sham-operated controls. In addition, the α-MSH-treated rats demonstrated less I/R-induced activation of intestinal NF-κB and myeloperoxidase activity after prolonged (6 h) reperfusion.

The discourse forms and processes we examine are ceremonial dialogue, dialogical performance, templatic ratifying, echo speech, ceremonial greeting, ritual wailing, evidentiality, speech reporting practices, parallelism, special languages, and shamanistic language use. We hypothesize that in lowland South America, discourse is the matrix for linguistic diffusion, i.e., that linguistic areas emerge within discourse areas. What we propose then is a discourse-centered approach to language change and history, parallel to a discourse-centered approach to language structure and use. Our survey includes a plea for a careful archiving of recorded and written materials dealing with lowland South American discourse.","https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.anthro.31.032902.105935",""

Herein, we report that MKS1is a negative regulator of the RTG pathway, acting between Rtg2p, a proximal sensor of mitochondrial function, and the bHLH transcription factors Rtg1p and Rtg3p. In mks1Δcells, RTG target gene expression is constitutive, bypassing the requirement for Rtg2p, and is no longer repressible by glutamate. We show further that Mks1p is a phosphoprotein whose phosphorylation pattern parallels that of Rtg3p in response to activation of the RTG pathway, and that Mks1p is in a complex with Rtg2p. MKS1 was previously implicated in the formation of [URE3], an inactive prion form of a negative regulator of the nitrogen catabolite repression pathway, Ure2p.rtgΔ mutations induce [URE3] and can do so independently of MKS1. We find that glutamate suppresses [URE3] formation, suggesting that the Mks1p effect on the formation of [URE3] can occur indirectly via regulation of theRTG pathway.","",""

Recently, methanol has been used to remove liquid blocking around such wells and restore well productivity.

The magnitude and nature of hyperglycemia-induced insulin resistance is not known. The purpose of the present study was to determine the biochemical mechanisms responsible for increased insulin-stimulated glucose disposal after the achievement of tight glycemic control with a mixed-split regimen. We performed hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps with indirect calorimetry and vastus lateralis muscle biopsies in eight type 2 diabetic patients who had poor glycemic control (HbA1c 10.1%) and again after 3 months of intensive insulin therapy designed to produce near-normoglycemia (HbA1c 6.6%). Improved glycemic control increased insulin-stimulated glucose disposal (5.16 ± 0.32 vs. 3.69 ± 0.33 mg · kg−1 · min−1; P &lt; 0.01); nonoxidative glucose disposal, which primarily reflects glycogen synthesis (2.11 ± 0.26 vs. 0.90 ± 0.16 mg · kg−1 · min−1; P &lt; 0.01); and glycogen synthase fractional velocity (0.094 ± 0.017 vs. 0.045 ± 0.007; P &lt; 0.05).

Sheep received 2 g/kg Hb, DCLHb ( n = 6), or pRBCs ( n = 7); control group received LR alone ( n = 6). After 2 h, anesthesia was discontinued; sheep were monitored in the animal intensive care unit for 48 h. DCLHb expanded blood volume more, but increased total blood Hb less, than pRBCs. Lower Hb and increased methemoglobin resulted in lower arterial oxygen content compared with the pRBCs. DCLHb caused pulmonary hypertension (from 13 to 30 mmHg) and elevated filling pressure (from 6 to 15 mmHg). Cardiac outputs (CO) were similar for all groups during anesthesia; however, during recovery CO increased only in the LR and packed pRBCs groups.

However, the mechanisms that regulate AR during diabetes remain unknown. Herein we report that several nitric oxide (NO) donors prevent ex vivo synthesis of sorbitol in erythrocytes obtained from diabetic or nondiabetic rats. Compared with erythrocytes of nondiabetic rats, the AR activity in the erythrocytes of diabetic rats was less sensitive to inhibition by NO donors or by AR inhibitors—sorbinil or tolrestat. Treatment with NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), an inhibitor of NO synthesis, enhanced AR activity and sorbitol accumulation in tissues of nondiabetic rats. Application of transdermal nitroglycerin patches or treatment with l-arginine did not inhibit AR activity or sorbitol accumulation in the tissues of nondiabetic animals. Treatment with l-NAME increased, whereas treatment with l-arginine or nitroglycerine patches decreased AR activity and sorbitol content in tissues of diabetic rats. These observations suggest that NO maintains AR in an inactive state and that this repression is relieved in diabetic tissues. Thus, increasing NO availability may be a useful strategy for inhibiting the polyol pathway and preventing the development of diabetes complications.","https://journals.org/diabetes/diabetes/article-pdf/51/10/3095/369288/db1002003095.pdf",""

Results are based on data with long‐term trends removed. The fact that the results do not have secular trends is an artifact of the analysis and should not be interpreted as an indication that sea level is not rising. The EOF reconstruction technique is discussed, and the resulting GMSL time series is compared to GMSL time series from Geosat and T/P altimetry and proxy GMSL time series estimated from global sea surface temperature data. The error assessment suggests the accuracy of the GMSL time series reconstructed from the tide gauge data is 2–4 mm RMS for a 1 year running mean smoothing and about 1 mm for a 5 year running mean smoothing. Several El Niño/La Niña events are evident in the GMSL, as well as significant low‐frequency variability at a 10–12 year period.

The patient was a 66-year-old female with hypertension, ischemic cardiomyopathy and dysrhythmias, who had evidence of an anterior wall myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure and angina. During coronary artery bypass surgery, antegrade cardioplegia was initially administered, but aortic insufficiency prevented adequate myocardial cooling. RCP was then administered and the heart cooled appropriately. After approximately 300 ml of blood cardioplegic solution had been given, the CS pressure suddenly dropped from 30 mmHg to zero. RCP administration was stopped, and the surgeon palpated a hematoma over the area of the CS, which later ruptured upon rotation of the heart. A primary repair could not be performed, so a pericardial patch was placed over the area of disruption, which appeared to provide adequate hemostasis. The patient was weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), but began to bleed freely from the CS distal to the pericardial patch. The patient was placed back on CPB to allow further repair of the CS, but the tissues were thin and friable and the ventricle disassociated from the ventricular septum. The situation was deemed not salvageable and further attempts at repair were stopped. The perfusionist should monitor infusion pressures and the CS waveform during RCP delivery. Changes in the waveform may indicate cannula malposition, loss of balloon seal, or, more rarely, CS rupture; such changes should prompt immediate cessation of RCP delivery.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1191/0267659102pf534cr",""

The disease has been monitored by collaborators through field surveys and in disease nurseries throughout the United States. In the year 2000, stripe rust occurred in more than 20 states throughout the country, which was the most widespread occurrence in recorded history. Although fungicide applications in many states reduced yield losses, the disease caused multimillion dollar losses in the United States, especially in Arkansas and California. One of the prevalent cultivars, RSI 5, had a yield loss of about 50% in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta region of California. In the Pacific Northwest, wheat losses due to stripe rust were minimal because cultivars with durable resistance were widely grown and the weather in May 2000 was not favorable for the disease. To identify races of the pathogen, stripe rust collections from 20 states across the United States were analyzed on 20 wheat differential cultivars, including Clement (Yr9, YrCle), Compair (Yr8, Yr19), and the Yr8 and Yr9 near-isogenic lines. In 2000, 21 previously identified races and 21 new races were identified. Of the 21 new races, 8 were pathotypes with combinations of virulences previously known to exist in the United States, and 13 had virulences to one or more of the lines Yr8, Yr9, Clement, or Compair. This is the first report of virulence to Yr8 and Yr9 in the United States. Most of the new races were also virulent on Express. Races that are virulent on Express have been identified in California since 1998. The races virulent on Yr8, Yr9, and Express were widely distributed in California and states east of the Rocky Mountains in 2000. The epidemic in 2000 demonstrates that increased efforts to breed for stripe rust resistance are needed in California, the south-central states, and some other states in the Great Plains. Diversification of resistance genes and use of durable resistance should prevent large-scale and severe epidemics.","https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/pdf/10.1094/PDIS.2002.86.1.39",""

We also show that lowering adenosine levels with ADA enzyme therapy has striking effects on gene expression that may be associated with resolution of pulmonary eosinophilia. In addition, we confirmed the nucleic acid and protein expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and monocyte chemoattractant protein-3, two candidate genes that may be regulated by adenosine. In conclusion, high-throughput profiling of gene expression by cDNA array hybridization has provided an overview of critical regulatory genes involved in airway inflammation in ADA-deficient mice.

The experimentally observed ultralow-noise behavior of a center-well avalanche photodiode is successfully reproduced in the model. It is found that the arrangement of different materials in the intrinsic region can modulate the positional dependence of impact ionization events, and hence the gain distribution. Consequently, the noise is sensitive to the structural parameters such as well thickness. Hot and energetic electrons are distinguished by their distribution in k space. This distinction is used to explain why the noise behavior is sensitive to the initial carrier excess energy from photogeneration but relatively insensitive to carrier energy gained from the electric field.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/92/8/4791/10621348/4791_1_online.pdf",""

Short–term studies have revealed varying recurrence rates based on therapy; however, little is currently known about the long–term natural history of the disease. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to address the question of long–term outcomes in AFS patients and make observations about the natural history of the disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients with follow–up ranging from 46 to 138 months were examined and interviewed, and their charts were reviewed. A quality–of–life survey was completed, and blood was drawn to measure immunoglobulin levels. RESULTS: All patients initially underwent treatment with a combination of surgery, systemic and/or topical corticosteroids, and immunotherapy to pertinent fungal and nonfungal antigens. Normalization of sinonasal mucosa (Kupferberg stage 0) was seen in 5 (29%) of 17 patients, whereas 76% demonstrated either normal or slight mucosal edema (Kupferberg stage 0 or 1). Serologic testing revealed fungus‐specific IgE significantly elevated in all 17 patients. CONCLUSION: The initial choice of therapy did not appear to affect the long–term outcome, and patients tended to be doing well overall. These results suggest that after successful initial treatment and control of AFS, many patients can achieve a quiescent disease state.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1067/mhn.2002.129806",""

They then empirically examine the extent to which environmental cues influence consumers' assessments of a store on various store choice criteria and how those assessments, in turn, influence patronage intentions. The results of two different studies provide support for the model.

Though electrically much more resistive, these Al-substituted films are all of orthorhombic structure and epitaxial quality on various oxide substrates, much like YBa2Cu3O7 and PrBa2Cu3O7 grown under similar conditions. The samples appeared to be shiny and dark as observed with the naked eye, but their electrical resistivity, ρ(T), ranged from ∼1 Ω cm at room temperature to about six orders of magnitude higher at T∼30 K. From the ρ(T) functional for both the target and the films, which, by and large, follows Mott’s T−1/4 law with their own relevant material constants, we believe that the mechanism of electrical conduction was mainly through variable range hopping. This suggests that the substitution of Al has caused extensive localization of charge carriers.

The shape of symmetric spikes is approximated by the function cosh−2. In order to explain this spike shape microscopically, which is our main concern, we observe that an electrode surface consists of many small crystals. A voltammogram spike is then interpreted as an averaged result of the finite-size effects occurring in each of these crystals. This view also allows us to comment on asymmetry in the voltammogram spikes. Our analysis is based on the rigorous statistical mechanical techniques of the Pirogov–Sinai theory. For the sake of simplicity, we model the deposition process by the one-component lattice gas. We apply the results to the underpotential deposition of Cu on Pt(111) in a sulfuric acid medium, and find very good agreement with experiment.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/117/6/2914/19039081/2914_1_online.pdf",""

Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated that the two-factor solution fit the data, and correlations with other psychological and eating disorder measures supported the factor's construct and concurrent validity. Further, the two factors were unrelated to a measure of acculturation and to generational level living in the U.

Low or no Rb expression is seen most commonly in high-grade breast adenocarcinomas, suggesting that a relationship may exist between loss of Rb and a less differentiated state, high proliferation rate, and high metastatic potential. In this study, we compared Rb function in two established breast adenocarcinoma cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, and in an established immortalized mammary epithelial cell line, MCF10A. Cells were synchronized in G0/G1 and were released for several durations, at which time total Rb protein, mRNA, and Rb/E2F/DNA complex formation were evaluated. Rb protein was significantly higher in the tumor cells than in MCF10A cells. However, Rb function was high for a longer duration in MCF10A cells as compared with MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Our data support the general conclusion that Rb function, but not necessarily Rb protein, is lower in highly malignant breast adenocarcinoma cells as compared with lower grade tumor cells. These results emphasize the relevance of assessing Rb function over Rb protein. This is particularly important if Rb is to be used as a prognostic indicator for breast adenocarcinoma.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/153537020222700508",""

This results from the fact that spontaneous phonon emission dominates carrier scattering in the 0 K limit.

We attempted to identify loci influencing the factors of IRS-related phenotypes using phenotypic data from 261 nondiabetic subjects distributed across 27 low-income Mexican-American extended families. Principal component factor analyses were performed using eight IRS-related phenotypes: fasting glucose (FG), fasting specific insulin (FSI), BMI, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), HDL cholesterol, ln triglycerides (ln TGs), and leptin (LEP). The factor analysis yielded three factors: factor 1 (BMI, LEP, and FSI), factor 2 (DBP and SBP), and factor 3 (HDL and ln TG). We conducted multipoint variance components linkage analyses on these factors with the program SOLAR using a 10–15 cM map. We found significant evidence for linkage of factor 1 to two regions on chromosome 6 near markers D6S403 (logarithm of odds [LOD] = 4.2) and D6S264 (LOD = 4.9).

However, total myocardial ATP was not significantly different in wild-type and mutant mice. Myocardial performance was examined using the isolated working heart preparation. As left atrial filling pressure increased, hearts from mutant mice were unable to generate equivalent stroke work compared with hearts from wild-type mice. Direct measurement of left ventricular end-diastolic volume using magnetic resonance imaging revealed that cardiac dysfunction was a consequence of impaired ventricular filling or diastolic dysfunction.

Activation of MAPKs was evident by 6 h postinfection. However, UV-irradiated MHV failed to activate MAPKs, which demonstrated that MHV replication was necessary for their activation. Several other MHV-permissive cell lines also showed activation of both p38 MAPK and JNK, which indicated that the MHV-induced stress-kinase activation was not restricted to any particular cell type. The upstream kinase responsible for activating MHV-induced p38 MAPK was the MAPK kinase 3. Experiments with a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, SB 203580, demonstrated that MHV-induced p38 MAPK activation resulted in the accumulation of interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNAs and an increase in the production of IL-6, regardless of MHV-induced general host protein synthesis inhibition. Furthermore, MHV production was suppressed in SB 203580-treated cells, demonstrating that activated p38 MAPK played a role in MHV replication. The reduced MHV production in SB 203580-treated cells was, at least in part, due to a decrease in virus-specific protein synthesis and virus-specific mRNA accumulation. Interestingly, there was a transient increase in the amount of phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) in infected cells, and this eIF4E phosphorylation was p38 MAPK dependent; it is known that phosphorylated eIF4E enhances translation rates of cap-containing mRNAs. Furthermore, the upstream kinase responsible for eIF4E phosphorylation, MAPK-interacting kinase 1, was also phosphorylated and activated in response to MHV infection. Our data suggested that host cells, in response to MHV replication, activated p38 MAPK, which subsequently phosphorylated eIF4E to efficiently translate certain host proteins, including IL-6, during virus-induced severe host protein synthesis inhibition. MHV utilized this p38 MAPK-dependent increase in eIF4E phosphorylation to promote virus-specific protein synthesis and subsequent progeny virus production. Enhancement of virus-specific protein synthesis through virus-induced eIF4E activation has not been reported in any other viruses.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.76.12.5937-5948.2002",""

In nondiabetic dogs, arterial plasma glucose concentration increased from 4.8 ± 0.3 to 21.5 ± 2.2 mmol/l 1 week after alloxan injection. In nondiabetic dogs, exercise increased myocardial oxygen consumption (MVo2) 3.4-fold, myocardial O2 delivery 3.0-fold, and heart rate 2.4-fold.

Different from previous works that utilized a thermal sensor fabricated on a scanning probe to obtain surface thermal images, the current approach employs a tunneling thermocouple made of a metal tip and an ultra-thin metal film deposited on the sample surface. The metal tip has a negligible Seebeck coefficient; while the metal film can be Bi2Te3 or a semiconducting polymer that has very high Seebeck coefficient and low thermal conductivity. Unlike the probe with a built-in thermal sensor, the measured thermoelectric voltage by the tunneling thermocouple is not affected by the tip-sample contact thermal resistance and air conduction, allowing quantitative temperature measurement with a spatial resolution limited by the metal film thickness, which can be 10–20 nm. We have tested the new approach using Ir or Pt-Ir -coated atomic force microscope (AFM) tips to obtain the surface temperature profiles of interconnect structures coated with a thin Cr film. The measured surface temperature gradient is larger and the maximum measured temperature is 60% higher than the corresponding values obtained by a thermal probe with a built-in thermocouple fabricated at the tip end. The two thermal imaging methods are currently being used to measure temperature distribution on the cross section of a 130 nm-technology silicon-on-insulator field-effect transistor.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2002-32112/2581719/23_1.pdf",""

The measured uncertainties were then incorporated into a simple Monte Carlo calculation for evaluation of various margin and fraction combinations. Satisfactory CTV dosimetric criteria were selected to be a minimum CTV dose of 95% of the PTV dose and at least 95% of the CTV receiving 100% of the PTV dose. The measured uncertainties were assumed to be Gaussian distributions. Systematic errors were added linearly and random errors were added in quadrature assuming no correlation to arrive at the total combined error. The Monte Carlo simulation written for this work examined the distribution of cumulative dose volume histograms for a large patient population using various margin and fraction combinations to determine the smallest margin required to meet the established criteria. The program examined 5 and 30 fraction treatments, since those are the only fractionation schemes currently used at our institution. The fractionation schemes were evaluated using no margin, a margin of just the systematic component of the total uncertainty, and a margin of the systematic component plus one standard deviation of the total uncertainty. It was concluded that (i) a margin of the systematic error plus one standard deviation of the total uncertainty is the smallest PTV margin necessary to achieve the established CTV dose criteria, and (ii) it is necessary to determine the uncertainties introduced by the specific equipment and procedures used at each institution since the uncertainties may vary among locations.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1120%2Fjacmp.v3i3.2561",""

The affected residues in these two mutant classes cluster differently when mapped to the 3-D structure of the spinach ortholog of Ilv5p. a−D+ mutations map to conserved internal domains known to be important for substrate and cofactor binding, whereas the a+D− mutations map to a C-terminal region on the surface of the protein.

Expression of telomerase is usually required for cell immortalization and long-term tumor growth. In humans, telomerase activity is tightly regulated during development and oncogenesis. The modulation of telomerase activity may therefore have important implications in antiaging and anticancer therapy. This review describes the currently known components of the telomerase complex and attempts to provide an update on the molecular mechanisms of human telomerase regulation.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/MMBR.66.3.407-425.2002",""

Binding of ligand is inhibited by increased extracellular potassium. This implies functional coordination because inhibition of the sodium pump would be counterproductive when extracellular potassium is elevated. The interesting biology of the CS binding site continues to stimulate investigations into the identity of endogenous ligands, their role as pump regulators at the cellular level, and as mediators of body fluid balance and blood pressure regulation. In addition to inhibition of sodium and potassium transport, there is considerable recent evidence suggesting that the sodium pump may act as a cell signaling receptor activated by CS binding and responding by coordination of intracellular signaling pathways that can be dependent on and also independent of the reduction in transmembrane ion flux resulting directly from pump inhibition. This signaling may influence cell survival, growth, and differentiation. Recent insight into the biology of pump regulation by CS is reviewed.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/153537020222700803",""

Although traditional speed enforcement has been shown to reduce speeds through the work area, enforcement under these conditions can be dangerous to both the motoring public and enforcement officers. The work zone layout often limits the locations at which an officer can set up to enforce the speed limit and the locations at which violators can be stopped. Automated speed enforcement technology could help eliminate the need to stop violators in a work zone, but it is not currently a popular concept in the United States because of concerns about motorist privacy. Researchers hypothesized that this technology could be useful for work zone enforcement if adapted to a more real-time operation. The initial testing of the concept of remote speed enforcement is summarized. An automated speed enforcement system (consisting of digital video and lidar technology) was meshed with a wireless communications system. The unit determined when vehicles exceeded a certain speed threshold. If a vehicle was detected as exceeding the threshold, a digital photograph was taken of the violator. This photograph was then transmitted to an observer stationed downstream of the site. The technical feasibility of the system was assessed through field tests. Focus groups of law enforcement personnel were used to determine potential acceptance of the system in the law enforcement community. Recommendations for future improvements and possible applications of the system are made.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/1818-04",""

The dynamical behavior of PBNs, which are probabilistic generalizations of Boolean networks, can be studied using Markov chain theory. In particular, the steady-state or long-run behavior of PBNs may reflect the phenotype or functional state of the cell. Approaches to alter the steady-state behavior in a specific prescribed manner, in cases of aberrant cellular states, such as tumorigenesis, would be highly beneficial. This paper develops a methodology for altering the steady-state probabilities of certain states or sets of states with minimal modifications to the underlying rule-based structure. This approach is framed as an optimization problem that we propose to solve using genetic algorithms, which are well suited for capturing the underlying structure of PBNs and are able to locate the optimal solution in a highly efficient manner. Several computer simulation experiments support the proposed methodology.","https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S0218339002000706",""

Pseudostiffness can be used to monitor microdamage and healing during the fatigue test. Pseudostiffness decreases consistently with an increasing number of loading cycles, which indicates that the microdamage occurs during the fatigue test. The significant recovery of pseudostiffness after rest periods indicates that there is a strong healing due to rest periods. The effects of hydrated lime on fatigue microdamage and healing have also been evaluated based on pseudostiffness recovery. The impact of healing during rest periods is evident and substantial. The degree of healing is mixture dependent. The ability of a mixture to heal is largely related to binder properties. Adding hydrated lime to the mixtures tested generally improved the healing potential of the mixtures. In general, stiffer mixtures have better healing and longer rest periods result in greater healing. The mechanism of healing is evaluated by two theories. The initial healing rate is governed by nonpolar surface energy, and the final healing rate is governed by polar surface energy.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/1789-08",""

SGU was estimated by the OGL insulin clamp method: subjects received a 7-h euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (insulin infusion rate = 100 mU · m−2 · min−1), and a 75-g OGL was ingested 3 h after starting the insulin clamp. After glucose ingestion, the steady-state glucose infusion rate during the insulin clamp was decreased appropriately to maintain euglycemia. SGU was calculated by subtracting the integrated decrease in glucose infusion rate during the 4-h period after glucose ingestion from the ingested glucose load (75 g). 3-[3H]glucose was infused during the 3-h insulin clamp before glucose ingestion to determine the rates of endogenous glucose production and glucose disappearance (Rd).

The objective of this study was to review the cause and management of CSF rhinorrhea arising from the sphenoid sinus. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: This is a retrospective chart review of 12 cases of CSF rhinorrhea arising from the sphenoid sinus that occurred in 11 patients. All patients were treated at a single institution between 1994 and 1999. RESULTS: All patients were managed surgically with sphenoid sinus fat obliteration using an endoscopic sublabial, transseptal approach. This approach was successful for all 12 cases, with median duration of follow‐up of 18 months. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopically assisted transseptal repair of CSF fistulas that originate within the sphenoid sinus offers an alternate approach to previously described methods of repair in this region. Advantages include wide access to the entire sphenoid sinus, improved access to laterally pneumatized regions within the sphenoid sinus, and rostral mucosal closure over the repair within the sinus.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1067/mhn.2002.122183",""

The irradiation were carried out at 77 K with 217 keV Ar+ ions to various doses between 3×1013 and 6×1015 Ar+/cm2. Postannealing was performed in dry O2 ambient at temperatures from 648 to 823 K, which are below Curie temperature (878 K). The optical measurement showed that the as-irradiated samples are as transparent as the unirradiated sample, indicating that the radiation-induced point defects are highly mobile even at 77 K. However, the long-range migration of oxygen interstitials were suppressed at 77 K. Volumetric expansion occurred when irradiation doses exceeded 1.25×1014 Ar+/cm2. Collective lattice distortion was observed in the sample that had received a dose of 1.5×1014 Ar+/cm2. This study shows that both disorder overlapping and the disorder-induced strain energy play important roles in the amorphization process. The regrowth of the amorphized layers depends on the microstructure of the damage. The activation energy for the regrowth of the amorphized layer that received more irradiation (6×1015 Ar+/cm2) is 0.74 eV, lower than the activation energy of the amorphized layer (1.20 eV) that received less irradiation (6×1014 Ar+/cm2).","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/91/6/3562/19136783/3562_1_online.pdf",""

The model enables the dynamic instability of sheet rolling to be correlated with work roll stiffness, rolling speed, inter-stand tension, roll-bite entry and exit thickness, and the sheet force resulted from the interactive action of the work roll with the plastic deformation of the rolled strip. It is found that roll-bit elastic-plastic deformation sheet force is nonlinearly coupled with the rollstack stiffness and also plays a dominant role in affecting rolling instability. In addition, whenever the frequency spectrum of the normal sheet forces containing spectral components that match the fundamental modes of the roll stand, resonance-like beating would occur. This highly linear physical phenomenon, which is accompanied by large vibration amplitudes in the active work rolls, is recognized as chatter. Although many different dynamic modes of instability including mode excitation and beating are induced in response to sheet forces of nonlinear and non-stationary in nature, however, the rolling system never responds chaotically.","https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S0219455402000609",""

The use of a multichannel approach and correlated targets not only enables us to obtain results in good agreement with experimental data, but also leads to a better understanding of electron correlation effects in these photoionization processes. In addition to numerous Rydberg-type autoionization states that have been identified in the multichannel study, substantial effects of the open-channel coupling have also been found in almost every channel. These effects are evidences of the strong electron correlation in the photoionization dynamics of this system. The most significant interchannel coupling effect exists in the photoionization to the 3σg−1 channels, in which a complete failure of the single-channel photoionization description is found in the shape resonance process. In contrast to earlier theoretical studies, we found only one shape resonance in the photoionization to the 3σg−1 channels instead of two separated multiplet-specific shape resonances. A full description of the resonant state requires the inclusion of coupling to other valence photoionization channels. The photoelectron angular distributions have also been computed and compared to the existing experimental data. Good agreement between experiment and theory has been achieved. In this study, we also calculated molecular orientation parameters under the fixed-nuclei approximation, which contain symmetry information about the resonances and outgoing waves and which can be used to characterize the dynamics of the photoionization.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/116/20/8863/19199856/8863_1_online.pdf",""

It is found that this arises because an adiabatic description of phase space structures at zero collisionality does not necessarily lead to continual adiabatic frequency sweeping.

RESULTS: Fifty‐two patients were included in the study. β2‐Transferrin analysis of collected specimen was the most efficacious means of confirming a CSF leak. High‐resolution computed tomography was the most informative radiographic study, yielding a sensitivity and an accuracy of 87%. Magnetic resonance cisternography, yielding a sensitivity and an accuracy of 78%, was instrumental in localizing the site of leak for a few cases but was most commonly corroborative. Using a graduated diagnostic approach, successful repair was attained in 88% of cases after 1 attempt and 98% after 1 or 2 attempts. CONCLUSION: For patients with skull base CSF fistulas, a graduated diagnostic approach with emphasis on confirmation of leak by β2‐transferrin analysis and precise localization by high‐resolution computed tomography is both efficacious and cost effective.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1067/mhn.2002.125755",""

Since burn trauma increases circulating catecholamine levels, which in turn modulate inflammatory cytokine production, we hypothesized that increased sympathetic activity after major burn trauma may trigger postburn cardiac p38 MAPK activation via an adrenergic receptor-mediated phenomenon. We examined adrenergic receptor populations involved in burn-activated cardiac stress signaling. Sprague Dawley rats were divided into six groups: 1) control, 2) control plus α1-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (2 μg/kg, intravenous), 3) control plus β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (1 μg/kg, intravenous), 4) burn (fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's 4 ml/kg/% burn), 5) burn plus α1-adrenergic antagonist prazosin (1 mg/kg, by mouth), and 6) burn plus β-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (3.3 mg/kg, by mouth). Phenylephrine, but not isoproterenol, increased cardiac p38 MAPK/JNK/NF-κB activation. Burn trauma activated p38 MAPK, JNK, and NF-κB, and this stress response was blocked by either prazosin or propranolol. Thus, stimulation of the adrenergic pathway may constitute one upstream activator of stress response in burn.","https://academic.oup.com/jbcr/article-pdf/23/3/172/24047506/00004630-200205000-00006.pdf",""

However, adaptive mutations in the NS3, NS5A, and/or NS5B proteins are required for efficient replication of these RNAs and increase by orders of magnitude the numbers of G418-resistant colonies selected following transfection of Huh7 cells. Here, we demonstrate that a subgenomic replicon (NNeo/3-5B) derived from an infectious molecular clone of a second genotype 1b virus, HCV-N (Beard et al., Hepatology 30:316-324, 1999) is also capable of efficient replication in Huh7 cells. G418-resistant cells selected following transfection with NNeo/3-5B RNA contained abundant NS5A antigen and HCV RNA detectable by Northern analysis. Replicon RNA in one of three clonally isolated cell lines contained no mutations in the NS3-NS5B polyprotein, confirming that adaptive mutations are not required for efficient replication in these cells. However, the deletion of a unique 4-amino-acid insertion that is present within the interferon sensitivity-determining region (ISDR) of the NS5A protein in wild-type HCV-N drastically decreased the number of G418-resistant colonies obtained following transfection of Huh7 cells. This effect could be reversed by inclusion of a previously described Con1 cell culture-adaptive mutation (S2005→I), confirming that this natural insertion has a controlling role in determining the replication capacity of wild-type HCV-N RNA in Huh7 cells. Additional selectable, dicistronic RNAs encoding NS2-NS5B, E1-NS5B, or the full-length HCV polyprotein were also capable of replication and gave rise to G418-resistant cell clones following transfection of Huh7 cells. We conclude that RNA derived from this documented infectious molecular clone has a unique capacity for replication in Huh7 cells in the absence of additional cell culture-adaptive mutations.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.76.6.2997-3006.2002",""

The survey was also an attempt to identify areas of improvement and innovative practices worthy of further development. State law enforcement agencies from 20 states were contacted by telephone to determine how work zones were enforced in their respective states. Officers were asked questions regarding funding for work zone enforcement; techniques used by law enforcement at work zones; locations in or near work zones where officers are typically stationed; the level of coordination between law enforcement, the state highway authority, and the construction contractor; and initiatives that helped maximize the effectiveness of law enforcement in work zones. A strategy identified in this research was the formation of specialized units to patrol work zones and to train other officers to effectively patrol work zones.

In this work we have investigated the increasing importance of molecular level effects, especially in terms of the contributions of the exposure and postexposure bake (PEB) steps to spatial variations in film composition. A mesoscale simulation of the PEB was used to model the discrete mass transport and reaction events that create the changes in film composition responsible for resist function. Local irregularities in resist composition are generated during the PEB, the magnitude of which can be related to the local concentration of acid. This study is focused on the establishment of an understanding of the effects of process and composition variables on the reaction product distribution. The reaction product distribution was calculated for an APEX®-like resist under a variety of exposure and bake conditions. These process variables have a profound influence on spatial irregularities in the composition gradient. Ultimately, it is the interaction of this reaction product distribution with the development process that will determine line edge roughness.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-pdf/20/1/185/8205587/185_1_online.pdf",""

The optimal clock period for floating-point benchmarks is 6 FO4. We find these optimal points to be insensitive to latch and clock skew overheads. Our study indicates that further pipelining can at best improve performance of integer programs by a factor of 2 over current designs.

Prolonged elevations of FFA levels reportedly impair GSIS, but no one has previously compared GSIS after prolonged exposure to saturated or unsaturated fat. Rats received a low-fat diet (Low-Fat) or one enriched with either saturated (Lard) or unsaturated fat (Soy) for 4 weeks. Insulin responses during hyperglycemic clamps were augmented by saturated but not unsaturated fat (580 ± 25, 325 ± 30, and 380 ± 50 pmol · l−1 · min−1 in Lard, Soy, and Low-Fat groups, respectively). Despite hyperinsulinemia, the amount of glucose infused was lower in the Lard compared with the Low-Fat group. Separate studies measured GSIS from the perfused pancreas. Without fatty acids in the perfusate, insulin output in the Lard group (135 ± 22 ng/30 min) matched that of Low-Fat rats (115 ± 13 ng/30 min), but exceeded that of Soy rats (80 ± 7 ng/30 min). When FFAs in the perfusate mimicked the quantity and composition of plasma FFAs in intact animals, in vivo insulin secretory patterns were restored. Because the GSIS of rats consuming Lard diets consistently exceeded that of the Soy group, we also assessed responses after 48-h infusions of lard or soy oil. Again, lard oil exhibited greater insulinotropic potency. These data indicate that prolonged exposure to saturated fat enhances GSIS (but this does not entirely compensate for insulin resistance), whereas unsaturated fat, given in the diet or by infusion, impairs GSIS. Inferences regarding the impact of fatty acids on GSIS that are based on models using unsaturated fat may not reflect the effects of saturated fat.","https://journals.org/diabetes/diabetes/article-pdf/51/6/1825/651147/db0602001825.pdf",""

An attenuated Pichinde virus variant (P2) and a virulent variant (P18) are being used to delineate pathogenic mechanisms that culminate in shock. In guinea pigs, the infection has been shown to begin in peritoneal macrophages following intraperitoneal inoculation and then spreads to the spleen and other reticuloendothelial organs. We show here that infection of the murine monocytic cell line P388D1 with either Pichinde virus variant resulted in the induction of inflammatory cytokines and effectors, including interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha. Since these genes are regulated in part by the cellular transcription factors NF-κB and RBP-Jκ, we compared the activities of NF-κB and RBP-Jκ in P388D1 cells following infection with Pichinde virus. The attenuated P2 virus inhibited NF-κB activation and caused a shift in the size of the RBP-Jκ complex. The virulent P18 virus showed less inhibition of NF-κB and failed to alter the size of the RBP-Jκ complex. Peritoneal cells from P2-infected guinea pigs showed induction of NF-κB RelA/p50 heterodimer and p50/p50 homodimer and manifested an increase in the size of RBP-Jκ. By contrast, P18 induced large amounts of the NF-κB p50/p50 dimer but failed to induce RelA/p50 or to cause an increase in the RBP-Jκ size. Taken together, these changes suggest that the attenuated viral strain induces an “activation” of macrophages, while the virulent form of the virus does not.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.76.3.1154-1162.2002",""

Evidence has been reported for a mechanism involving HIV binding to (and signaling) resting CD4 lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues, resulting in up-regulation of lymph node homing receptors and enhanced homing after these cells enter the blood, and induction of apoptosis in many of these cells during the homing process, caused by secondary signaling through homing receptors. Supportive evidence for this as a major pathogenic mechanism requires demonstration that CD4 lymphocytes in HIV+ individuals do migrate to lymph nodes at enhanced rates. Studies herein show that freshly isolated CD4 lymphocytes labeled with 111Indium and intravenously reinfused back into HIV+ human donors do home to peripheral lymph nodes at rates two times faster than normal. They also home at enhanced rates to iliac and vertebral bone marrow. In contrast, two hepatitis B virus-infected subjects displayed less than normal rates of blood CD4 lymphocyte migration to peripheral lymph nodes and bone marrow. Furthermore, the increased CD4 lymphocyte homing rates in HIV+ subjects returned to normal levels after effective, highly active antiretroviral therapy treatment, showing that the enhanced homing correlated with active HIV replication. This is the first direct demonstration of where and how fast CD4 lymphocytes in the blood traffic to tissues in normal and HIV-infected humans. The results support the theory that the disappearance of CD4 lymphocytes from the blood of HIV+ patients is a result of their enhanced migration out of the blood (homing) and dying in extravascular tissues.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1189/jlb.72.2.271",""

Multiple cytological and biochemical tests verified that caveolin-1-GFP was a reliable marker for endogenous caveolin-1. At steady state, most caveolin-1-GFP was either at the cell surface associated with invaginated caveolae or near the centrosome in caveosomes. Live cell fluorescence imaging indicated that while much of the caveolin-1-GFP in caveolae at the cell surface was relatively sessile, numerous, highly motile caveolin-1-GFP-positive vesicles were present within the cell interior. These vesicles moved at speeds ranging from 0.3-2 μm/second and movement was abolished when microtubules were depolymerized with nocodazole. In the absence of microtubules, cell surface invaginated caveolae increased more than twofold and they became organized into linear arrays. Complete depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton with latrunculin A, by contrast, triggered rapid and massive movements of caveolin-positive structures towards the centrosomal region of the cell. The caveolar membrane system of CHO cells therefore appears to be comprised of three caveolin-1-containing compartments. These include caveolae that are confined to the cell surface by cortical actin filaments, the peri-centrosomal caveosomes and caveolar vesicles, which we call `cavicles', that move constitutively and bi-directionally along microtubules between the cell surface and caveosomes. The behavior of cavicles suggests that they function as transport intermediates between caveolae and caveosomes.","http://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article-pdf/115/22/4327/1483344/4327.pdf",""

The soil line concept is used to develop predictive relationships between the amount of OM within the surface horizon of the soil profile and intensity in the red and near‐infrared bands. The soil line Euclidean distance (SLED) technique is based on relating a pixel's Euclidean distance of the red and near‐infrared intensity value to the red and near‐infrared intensity value for the bottom‐most point on the soil line. The technique is evaluated for two fields in the U.S. Midwest.

Traditional cache architectures assume that each level in the cache hierarchy has a single, uniform access time. Increases in on-chip communication delays will make the hit time of large on-chip caches a function of a line's physical location within the cache. Consequently, cache access times will become a continuum of latencies rather than a single discrete latency. This non-uniformity can be exploited to provide faster access to cache lines in the portions of the cache that reside closer to the processor. In this paper, we evaluate a series of cache designs that provides fast hits to multi-megabyte cache memories. We first propose physical designs for these Non-Uniform Cache Architectures (NUCAs). We extend these physical designs with logical policies that allow important data to migrate toward the processor within the same level of the cache. We show that, for multi-megabyte level-two caches, an adaptive, dynamic NUCA design achieves 1.5 times the IPC of a Uniform Cache Architecture of any size, outperforms the best static NUCA scheme by 11%, outperforms the best three-level hierarchy--while using less silicon area--by 13%, and comes within 13% of an ideal minimal hit latency solution.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/605432.605420",""

We propose a novel process based decomposition approach for distributed processing of such large-scale simulation problems. The proposed method splits up the large-scale problem based on the physics or computational units of the problem and distributes the computational load over a LAN. This method allows the problem to be solved in parallel in a distributed framework in a computationally efficient manner. The greatest advantage of this approach is that this method allows performance enhancement at little extra cost by better utilizing existing computational resources (CPU cycles). Based on the complexity of the decomposition, we categorize large-scale simulation processes into three classes. We present a distributed processor (OPTIMA) that enables application programs to be run in a distributed framework. Examples that demonstrate the efficacy of this method are presented. Results show that running the simulations in parallel on a distributed platform speeds up the process considerably with small hardware or software costs.","https://onepetro.org/SPEATCE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/77721-MS/2919731/spe-77721-ms.pdf",""

The exchange rate studies indicate that the rate of this reaction is dominantly sensitive to the O+O2 entrance channel characteristics of the potential energy surface. A detailed consideration of the dynamics of the intermediate ozone complex reveals three important classes. In one class, the complex adopts an ozonelike geometry, largely undergoing asymmetric stretchinglike motion until it dissociates. In a second class, the oxygen atom and molecule never visit the ozonelike geometry but rather remain separated by relatively large distances trapped near the angular momentum barrier in the entrance channel of a pseudo-effective potential. These complexes, which cannot undergo exchange, are, nevertheless, found to contribute significantly to ozone formation at high density of the third body suggesting that the association of the high-density effective formation rate constant with twice the exchange rate may not be valid. The third class can be considered a hybrid of the first two, spending some time as an ozonelike complex and some time as a large atom-diatomic complex. This third class provides a mechanism for rearranging atom locations in the complex (e.g., end and middle position swapping) and, consequently, would not be well accounted for by statistical treatments of the ozone complex based on a single ozonelike reference geometry. In general, the survival time distributions of the complexes are found to be nonexponential. However, when the detailed survival time distributions are coupled with a Lennard-Jones collision model for the stabilization step, the experimental ozone formation rate can be adequately modeled over a broad range of temperature and density.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/117/16/7603/19316968/7603_1_online.pdf",""

Furthermore, immunocytochemical studies have shown the presence of several paramyxoviral species in OCs from patients with Paget's disease.

In recent years, partitioning interwell tracer tests (PITT) have gained increasing popularity as a means to characterize NAPL saturation distribution in situ. In this method a suite of conservative and partitioning tracers are injected into the contaminated site. The chromatographic separation between the conservative and the partitioning tracers can be used to infer NAPL saturation distribution. The conventional approach to the analysis of the tracer response uses a first‐order method of moments to compute average NAPL saturation in the tracer swept regions and cannot provide detailed spatial distribution of the NAPL. We propose a computationally efficient streamline‐based inverse method for analyzing partitioning interwell tracer tests to estimate three dimensional spatial variation of NAPL saturation in the subsurface. Our approach is based on an analogy between streamlines and seismic ray tracing and relies on an analytic sensitivity computation method that yields sensitivities of the partitioning tracer response to subsurface parameters such as porosity, hydraulic conductivity, and NAPL saturation in a single streamline simulation. The inversion of tracer response is carried out in a manner analogous to seismic waveform inversion whereby we first match the “first arrival” followed by matching the “amplitudes” of the tracer response. The power and utility of the method is illustrated using synthetic and field applications. The field example is from the Hill Airforce Base, Utah, where partitioning tracer tests were conducted in an isolated test cell with 4 injection wells, 3 extraction wells, and 12 multilevel samplers. Tracer responses from 51 sampling locations are analyzed to determine hydraulic conductivity variations and NAPL saturation distribution in the test cell. Finally, a performance comparison with simulated annealing shows that our proposed approach is faster by 3 orders of magnitude.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2001WR000597",""

The ability of FDPM to determine size and interaction characteristics of the particulate phase of colloidal suspensions depends largely upon the accuracy and precision of FDPM-measured optical properties. In this work, FDPM measurements at multiple modulation frequencies and multiple source-to-detector distances are systematically analyzed for obtaining accurate and precise scattering properties of colloidal suspensions. Two different data analysis methods, multifrequency (MF) nonlinear regression and multidistance (MD) linear regression, and corresponding various strategies for fitting to the optical diffusion equation are investigated. The accuracy and precision of estimated scattering coefficients by different approaches are compared. Results show that MD linear regression with simultaneous regression of average intensity and phase shift or amplitude and phase shift data provides the best data analysis method since it provides not only accurate estimated parameters but also an accurate estimation of their uncertainties. Finally, an important criterion, derived from the photon diffusion model, is proposed for checking the consistency of measurement data and optimizing experimental conditions for FDPM characterization of multiply scattering materials.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/rsi/article-pdf/73/2/383/19030333/383_1_online.pdf",""

Despite early assessments of the revolutionary nature of the Internet and the enormous transformations it would bring about, the changes have been less dramatic and more embedded in existing practices and power relations of everyday life. This review explores researchers' questions, approaches, and insights within anthropology and some relevant related fields, and it seeks to identify promising new directions for study. The general conclusion is that the technologies comprising the Internet, and all the text and media that exist within it, are in themselves cultural products. Anthropology is thus well suited to the further investigation of these new, and not so new, phenomena.","https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.anthro.31.040402.085436",""

Here, similar changes in the level and pattern of prolactin receptor (PrlR) expression were observed while screening for differentially expressed genes in C/EBPβnull mice. PR patterning was also altered in PrlRnull mice, as well as in mammary tissue transplants from both PrlRnull and signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) 5a/b-deficient mice, with concomitant defects in hormone-induced proliferation. Down-regulation of PR and activation of Stat5 phosphorylation were seen after estrogen and progesterone treatment in both C/EBPβnull and wild-type mice, indicating that these signaling pathways were functional, despite the failure of steroid hormones to induce proliferation. IGF binding protein-5, IGF-II, and insulin receptor substrate-1 all displayed altered patterns and levels of expression in C/EBPβnull mice, suggestive of a change in the IGF signaling axis. In addition, small proline-rich protein (SPRR2A), a marker of epidermal differentiation, and keratin 6 were misexpressed in the mammary epithelium of C/EBPβnull mice. Together, these data suggest that C/EBPβ is a master regulator of mammary epithelial cell fate and that the correct spatial pattern of PR and PrlR expression is a critical determinant of hormone-regulated cell proliferation.","http://academic.oup.com/mend/article-pdf/16/12/2675/8962402/mend2675.pdf",""

We show how to select the right paths, how to generate accurate predictions, and how to get this information in a timely way.

As an endothelium-derived relaxing factor, a mediator of immune responses, a neurotransmitter, a cytotoxic free radical, and a signaling molecule, NO plays crucial roles in virtually every cellular and organ function in the body. The discovery of NO synthesis has unified traditionally diverse research areas in nutrition, physiology, immunology, pathology, and neuroscience. Increasing evidence over the past decade shows that many dietary factors, including protein, amino acids, glucose, fructose, cholesterol, fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, phytoestrogens, ethanol, and polyphenols, are either beneficial to health or contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic diseases partially through modulation of NO production by inducible NOS or constitutive NOS. Although most published studies have focused on only a single nutrient and have generated new and exciting knowledge, future studies are necessary to investigate the interactions of dietary factors on NO synthesis and to define the underlying molecular mechanisms.","https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.nutr.22.110901.145329",""

The purpose of this study is to calculate with an inverse approach the power input of the chamber heating elements in order to achieve specific temperature and heat flux distributions on the design surface (wafer). Once a reasonable solution is found, the experimental confirmation takes place. The study starts with characterizing and modeling the system formed by an axisymmetric vacuum chamber designed to reproduce the major characteristics of a generic RTP process in the semiconductor industry, such as for rapid thermal annealing of wafers. A Monte Carlo model is employed for the radiative heat transmission using measured specular/diffuse reflectivities for the radiation shields, and diffuse emissivities for all other surfaces. The actual geometry of the chamber is modeled. The inverse problem is then solved by using the Conjugate Gradient Method. Using the calculated input powers of the heaters to maintain an isothermal wafer as the initial setting for the instrumented radiative chamber, experimental measurements of the steady temperature distributions on the elements of the chamber and on the wafer surface are taken. The study ends by comparing the experimental and numerical results to determine the necessary enhancement to apply to the system model with the final objective of developing an effective design tool using an inverse approach.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2002-33844/2581028/237_1.pdf",""

Here, we investigate whether PKC-mediated receptor phosphorylation is involved in the homologous or heterologous regulation of endogenous sst2 receptors in AR42J pancreatic acinar cells upon stimulation by agonist or by cholecystokinin (CCK) or bombesin (BBS). Somatostatin, PMA, CCK, and BBS all increased sst2A receptor phosphorylation 5- to 10-fold within minutes. Somatostatin binding also caused rapid internalization of the ligand-receptor complex, and PMA, CCK, and BBS all stimulated this internalization further. Additionally, sst2 receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase was desensitized by all treatments. Somatostatin, as well as peptidic (SMS201–995) and nonpeptidic (L-779,976) sst2 receptor agonists increased the EC50 for somatostatin inhibition 20-fold. In contrast, pretreatment with BBS, CCK, or PMA caused a modest 2-fold increase in the EC50 for cyclase inhibition. Whereas the PKC inhibitor GF109203X abolished sst2A receptor phosphorylation by CCK, BBS, and PMA, it did not alter the effect of somatostatin, demonstrating that these reactions were catalyzed by different kinases. Consistent with a functional role for PKC-mediated receptor phosphorylation, GF109203X prevented PMA stimulation of sst2 receptor internalization. Surprisingly, however, GF109203X did not inhibit BBS and CCK stimulation of sst2A receptor endocytosis. These results demonstrate that homologous and heterologous hormones induce sst2A receptor phosphorylation by PKC-independent and -dependent mechanisms, respectively, and produce distinct effects on receptor signaling and internalization. In addition, the heterologous hormones also modulate sst2 receptor internalization by a novel mechanism that is independent of receptor phosphorylation.","http://academic.oup.com/mend/article-pdf/16/11/2502/8962021/mend2502.pdf",""

The Ferron Sandstone of east‐central Utah is an analog for fluviodeltaic reservoirs; its excellent outcrop exposures are ideal for detailed study. Ground‐penetrating radar (GPR) data were collected in and between two cored boreholes and are used to build a 2‐D fluid permeability model in four steps. First, an anisotropic GPR propagation velocity model is obtained from traveltime tomography between two boreholes and between each borehole and the earth's surface. Second, the geometry of the sedimentological features is imaged by prestack Kirchhoff depth migration of constant‐offset GPR data acquired along a line between the two holes at the earth's surface. Third, a background permeability is assigned to each layer by interpolating the geometrical average of the measured permeabilities in each sedimentological element. Finally, the spatial distribution of flow baffles and barriers is estimated by calibrating the instantaneous amplitude and frequency of the surface GPR data associated with the mudstone layers in the boreholes via cluster analysis. The result is an integrated model that contains GPR velocity, lithology, and fluid permeability distributions. Low GPR velocities correspond to mudstones with low permeability. The main mudstone layers (potential barriers and/or baffles to fluid flow) do not appear to be continuous between the boreholes, which means that interpretations based on borehole data alone would overestimate element continuity and thereby underestimate effective permeability.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/1.1512746",""

The choice of low BTU biomass fuels may include conventional agricultural or unconventional animal based biomass fuels depending upon local availability and transportation costs. For power plants located near feedlots where cattle are fattened for slaughter, the best choice of renewable biomass fuel is feedlot manure, properly referred to as feedlot biomass (FB). Coal can be mixed with FB in a 90:10 (coal:FB) ratio by mass and fired in existing boiler burners. A 30 KW (100,000 BTU/hr) boiler burner facility was built and tested for firing coal or coal-FB blends at Texas A&M University. FB has a moisture content ranging from 20% to 40% moisture, but most of the previous data have been generated using low moisture FB (<10% moisture) due to problems processing moist manure. The current work will investigate the effect of different moisture levels using external water injection. The boiler burner was modified with an air atomizing water injector. At a fixed equivalence ratio and swirl number for the secondary inlet air stream, the effect of different moisture levels and different biomass particles on boiler performance was investigated. NOx, O2, and CO profiles along the axis of the furnace were obtained. The effect of atomizing air on the co-firing performance was also investigated. The results are summarized as follows: just with atomizing air is the wter injector, the NOx concentrations increased from 350 ppm to 650 ppm while CO decreased from 46,000 ppm to 18,000 ppm. External water injection decreased the NOx pollutant emissions from 570 ppm (zero external water) to 300 ppm (40% water in FB), but increased CO emissions from 2,500 ppm (zero external water) to 10,500 ppm (40% water in FB) due to incomplete combustion. Smaller sized particles of FB in the blended fuel produced less NOx but more CO.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/ETCE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/ETCE2002/CAE-29016/2571769/77_1.pdf",""

On the basis of regional blood flow measurements, the two muscles appear to be nonuniformly recruited at rest, but we anticipated that the two muscles would become uniformly recruited at heavy exercise to efficiently support the high energy requirements of ventilation. We used fluorescent microspheres to measure regional blood flow within the two muscles as an index of muscle recruitment from rest to heavy treadmill exercise in well-trained foxhounds. However, the heterogeneity of blood flow at rest persisted as exercise workloads were increased. Blood flow per gram of muscle remained twofold greater in ventral than dorsal regions of both muscles from rest to heavy exercise. This pattern was matched by a twofold greater regional mechanical advantage in ventral than dorsal regions of the two muscles measured anatomically. Hence blood flow was preferentially and efficiently distributed to those regions capable of generating the greatest inspiratory power independent of muscle mass. The two muscles were recruited from rest to heavy exercise as a single functional unit, not as two muscles under separate control.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/japplphysiol.00230.2002",""

In the resting cell, eIF4E is normally kept in an inactive state by binding to 4E-BP1, its binding protein. Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 results in dissociation of the eIF4E-4E-BP1 complex allowing eIF4E to initiate peptide synthesis. IGF-I stimulated protein synthesis, augmented phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and promoted the dissociation of eIF4E from 4E-BP1.

However, the higher-order neural circuitry of the visual system, consisting of cerebropleural interneurons that receive synaptic input from photoreceptors and project to pedal motor neurons that mediate visually guided behaviors, is only partially understood. In this report we have examined the central projections of two identified classes of cerebropleural interneurons that receive excitatory or inhibitory synaptic input from identified photoreceptors. The classification of the interneurons was based on both morphological and electrophysiological criteria. Type I interneurons received monosynaptic excitatory or inhibitory synaptic input from identified photoreceptors and projected to postsynaptic targets within the cerebropleural ganglion. Type II interneurons, characterized here for the first time, received polysynaptic excitatory or inhibitory synaptic input from identified photoreceptors and projected to postsynaptic targets in either the ipsilateral pedal ganglion or the contralateral cerebropleural ganglion. Type I interneurons exhibited unique intraganglionic projections to different regions of the cerebropleural ganglion, depending on whether they received excitatory or inhibitory synaptic input from identified photoreceptors. Type I interneurons that received monosynaptic excitatory input from identified B photoreceptors terminated near the cerebropleural commissure and had multiple regions of varicosities located at branches that projected from the primary axon. Type I interneurons that received monosynaptic inhibitory input from identified B photoreceptors projected to the anterior cerebropleural ganglion and exhibited varicosities localized to the terminal region of the primary axonal process. Type II interneurons that received polysynaptic inhibitory input from identified photoreceptors projected to the contralateral cerebropleural ganglion. Most type II interneurons that projected to the pedal ganglia received polysynaptic excitatory input from identified photoreceptors. These results indicate that there is at least one additional interneuron in the higher-order visual circuit between type I interneurons and pedal motor neurons responsible for the generation of phototactic locomotion in Hermissenda.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jn.00319.2001",""

Monthly three‐dimensional trajectories are calculated for 1996 and 1997 from the United Kingdom Meteorological Office assimilated data. Mass exchange shows nearly the same annual variations as previous Eulerian studies: (1) the northern net downward flux across the extratropical tropopause shows a primary maximum in late spring and early summer and secondary in winter, which is consistent with observational measurements, (2) the southern net downward flux has a peak only in winter, and (3) the extratropical and tropical air exchange across the upper boundary of the middleworld exhibits a pronounced annual variation with a wintertime maximum and summertime minimum. The occurrence of the largest downward flux over the western edges of the Pacific and Atlantic and near the Mediterranean suggests that tropopause folding and baroclinic disturbances in midlatitude storm tracks are the primary agent for the intrusion of stratospheric air into the troposphere. Tropical upward transport occurs in association with the monsoon anticyclones, and the greatest diabatic injection into the tropical stratosphere takes place over the summer hemisphere subtropics according to the seasonal variation of the Hadley circulation. Comparison of the Lagrangian flux estimate across the 100‐hPa surface with the estimate by the downward control mechanism using the residual mean meridional circulation shows reasonable correspondence.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2002JD002441",""

Feasible solutions or upper bounds are obtained with the help of greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP). A wide variety of cuts is introduced to tighten the linear programming (LP) relaxation of the original mixed-integer program. To find violated cuts, it is necessary to solve a separation problem. A substantial portion of the paper is aimed at describing the heuristics developed for this purpose. A new approach for obtaining feasible solutions from the LP relaxation is also discussed.

Skin conditions from acne to leprosy, which were once shunned by society, are now easily treated with oral antibiotics. Objective:: Antibiotics are chemicals derived from bacteria and fungi that uniquely have antibacterial action. The most notable example is penicillin, which is derived from a mold. With hundreds of antibiotics available to the practicing physician, improper use of these drugs has become widespread and expensive and has spawned resistant strains. For the dermatologist, antibiotics are vital weapons in the drug armamentarium for treating various skin conditions. Conclusion:: This review explores the newest and most common oral, parenteral, and topical antibiotics used in dermatology, their indications, adverse effects, dosage, and spectrum of activity. Furthermore, systemic antibacterial prophylaxis and vaccines pertinent to dermatology are discussed. The penicillins, cephalosporins, tetracyclines, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, sulfonamides, aminoglycosides, lincosamides, folate inhibitors, and a new synthetic class of drugs, the oxazolidinones, are reviewed.

The emissions from vehicles idling shows little compositional variation with low soot formation and elemental carbon representing between 12 and 21% of total carbon emitted. This variation is important to consider when performing source apportionment calculations as the difference in fraction carbon emitted as elemental carbon is used to separate diesel emissions from gasoline‐powered vehicle emissions and other sources. The molecular composition of the organic particulate matter was quantified for samples collected from each of the four vehicles under load plus a composite sample of all four vehicles while idling.

Computational requirements for these analyses have increased dramatically because top‐down layer‐stripping migration is needed to derive interval velocities directly instead of using rms velocities and then converting into interval velocities. We establish exact equations for 1‐D and 2‐D residual velocity analysis in the depth‐plane‐wave domain and use these in an iterative and interactive migration velocity analysis program. The new method updates interval velocities directly in a top‐down residual‐difference correction for all layers after prestack depth migration instead of top‐down layer‐stripping migration followed by residual analysis. This makes the new method a suitable tool for migration velocity analysis, especially for 3‐D surveys. We test the method on synthetic and field data. The field data results show that a reasonable velocity model is obtained and most common image gathers are correctly imaged using no more than four iterations.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/1.1500388",""

The method overcomes two essential difficulties: (1) the low accuracy in calculation of K0 because of the singularities at the nuclei where existing basis sets yield inadequate results, and (2) the lack of sufficiently accurate data on excited states (including the continuum spectrum) for calculation of Kv. This is achieved by summing up the contributions of the excited states to result in expressions with only the ground state wave function and its derivatives, and excluding the singularities by canceling mutually compensating diagonal matrix elements in K0 and Kv. After these essential changes K=K0+Kv is no longer a small difference between two large numbers, and it can be calculated with reasonable accuracy, while the separation of Kv allows one to reveal the PJT origin of the instability: the direction of distortion for which the negative Kv value overcomes the positive K0 one. A further insight into the origin of the instability is reached by estimating the relative contribution of the most active excited states for different distortions (and for the same distortions in similar compounds), since the contribution of the continuum states (the largest part of Kv) does not affect the bonding and hence the differences in Kv.

The accurate evaluation of natural fracture geometry in the subsurface is difficult because of the sampling problems inherent to wellbores and indirect investigation methods such as seismic. Because of these limitations in observational capability, predictive models are needed to provide more constraint on natural fracture characteristics. One approach is to look at the mechanics of fracture propagation in sedimentary rock as controlled by subcritical crack growth (also known as stress-corrosion cracking). We have measured the subcritical fracture properties of numerous sedimentary rocks, including core samples from petroleum reservoirs, in conjunction with detailed petrographic analysis. Our preliminary results suggest that carbonates and sandstones tend to have very different subcritical fracture properties, and the variation in sandstone properties can be linked to grain and cement mineralogy and volume fractions.","https://onepetro.org/speisrm/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/78207-MS/2932401/spe-78207-ms.pdf",""

The technique is readily applied to prefabricated electrodes with separation up to 1 μm, which can be defined using optical lithography.

Materials and Methods:: This article will describe the technique of a secondary tuck as well as provide the results of a quality evaluation study of our patients who have undergone a secondary tuck. Results:: The study revealed that more than 90% of those who had responded were satisfied with the secondary tuck and would undergo the surgery again. Respondents also stated that recovery time for the surgery was less than 1 week, and that they experienced little to no complications. Discussion:: A traditional facelift combined with a secondary tuck, performed under local anesthesia preferably 12–24 months after the original facelift, is a viable option for those seeking to maintain the youthful appearance obtained from the original facelift. The secondary tuck can be performed periodically thereafter when the patient desires further maintenance.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/074880680201900403",""

Separate ward, well-baby nursery, and ambulatory rotations were combined into a 4-month block rotation. Two parallel teams staff the inpatient ward and newborn nursery; on alternating days, the admitting team staffs an afternoon clinic, seeing ward and nursery patients in follow-up as well as regular clinic and referral patients. Two group meetings were held during each rotation for 2 years, and questionnaires were distributed to participating residents. All 90 residents who rotated through the combined service participated in at least 1 group meeting, only 26 returned questionnaires that limited evaluation of the program. The most important positive feature of the rotation was the continuity of patient care allowed by combining the venues into 1 rotation and by the longer duration of the rotation. Concerns included the challenges of time management and fluctuations in workload across the 3 patient care venues. Upper level residents reported that the rotation confirmed career decisions for primary care. These preliminary observations suggest that a vertically integrated rotation provides improvement in perceived continuity of care and introduces residents to the time management challenges of primary care pediatrics.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/000992280204100906",""

For nonvolatile materials in which nucleation occurs randomly and homogeneously throughout the sample, a slowing of surface phase change kinetics is predicted as specimen thickness decreases. This deceleration originates from a reduction in the number of grains contributing to surface transformation and the progressively more two-dimensional growth geometry of each grain as the sample becomes thinner. Sublimation increases the relative impingement velocity of subsurface nucleated grains and the interface, thus accelerating surface phase change (versus nonvolatile materials) in the absence of thickness effects. In thin films, the accelerating influence of sublimation competes with the retarding effect of finite specimen size, and thus transformation kinetics can be faster or slower than for nonvolatile materials, depending upon sample thickness. Finally, the model is fit to experimental data for the crystallization of volatile amorphous solid water films of varying thickness. Good agreement between experiment and theory is found, suggesting that our model captures the essential physics of simultaneous surface phase change and sublimation for finite specimens.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/117/17/8110/19209776/8110_1_online.pdf",""

Further work has indicated that this is at least partially mediated by an enhancement in nitric oxide (NO) production by the endothelial isoform of NO synthase (eNOS) due to increases in both eNOS expression and level of activation. The effects on eNOS abundance are primarily mediated at the level of gene transcription, and they are dependent on estrogen receptors (ERs), which classically serve as transcription factors, but they are independent of estrogen response element action. Estrogen also has potent nongenomic effects on eNOS activity mediated by a subpopulation of ERα localized to caveolae in endothelial cells, where they are coupled to eNOS in a functional signaling module. These observations, which emphasize dependence on cell surface-associated receptors, provide evidence for the existence of a steroid receptor fast-action complex, or SRFC, in caveolae. Estrogen binding to ERα on the SRFC in caveolae leads to Gαi activation, which mediates downstream events. The downstream signaling includes activation of tyrosine kinase-MAPK and Akt/protein kinase B signaling, stimulation of heat shock protein 90 binding to eNOS, and perturbation of the local calcium environment, leading to eNOS phosphorylation and calmodulin-mediated eNOS stimulation. These unique genomic and nongenomic processes are critical to the vasoprotective and atheroprotective characteristics of estrogen. In addition, they serve as excellent paradigms for further elucidation of novel mechanisms of steroid hormone action.","http://academic.oup.com/edrv/article-pdf/23/5/665/8860978/edrv0665.pdf",""

The natural fracture network is modeled as a system of intersecting fractures that form a main pathway for acid transport and dissolution. The tails of the intersected fractures increase the leakoff from the main pathway and are accounted for in the model. The fracture network acidizing model is supported by comparisons with laboratory experiments and smaller scale simulations that determined the nature of acid channeling at fracture intersections. Model results illustrate the effects of variations in fracture properties on acid propagation. Prats' model is used to calculate the skin factor of an acidized, naturally-fractured well. The model predicts deeper acid penetration (up to 5 meters) under matrix conditions than would be possible with only matrix flow. Acid-etched fractures of this length result in skin factors of -2 to -3, similar to that observed in many carbonate acidizing treatments.","https://onepetro.org/SPEIOR/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/75252-MS/2929007/spe-75252-ms.pdf",""

Correlations among the Wechsler scale subtests were lower than among those for the K-BIT, so the former may tap different cognitive functions and yield more clinically useful information than the latter.

This plus end-directed motor carries intraflagellar transport particles from the base to the tip of the organelle, where structural components of the axoneme are assembled. Here we test the idea that kinesin-II also is essential for signal transduction. When mating-type plus (mt+) and mating-type minus (mt−) gametes of the unicellular green algaChlamydomonas are mixed together, binding interactions between mt+ and mt− flagellar adhesion molecules, the agglutinins, initiate a signaling pathway that leads to increases in intracellular cAMP, gamete activation, and zygote formation. A critical question inChlamydomonas fertilization has been how agglutinin interactions are coupled to increases in intracellular cAMP. Recently,fla10 gametes with a temperature-sensitive defect in FLA10 kinesin-II were found to not form zygotes at the restrictive temperature (32°C). We found that, although the rates and extents of flagellar adhesion in fla10 gametes at 32°C are indistinguishable from wild-type gametes, the cells do not undergo gamete activation. On the other hand, fla10 gametes at 32°C regulated agglutinin location and underwent gamete fusion when the cells were incubated in dibutyryl cAMP, indicating that their capacity to respond to the cAMP signal was intact. We show that the cellular defect in the fla10 gametes at 32°C is a failure to undergo increases in cAMP during flagella adhesion. Thus, in addition to being essential for assembly and maintenance of the structural components of flagella, kinesin-II/intraflagellar transport plays a role in sensory transduction in these organelles.","",""

In the current experiments, we studied formation and maturation of cell–matrix interactions under conditions in which we could distinguish local from global matrix remodeling. Local remodeling was measured by the movement of collagen-embedded beads towards the cells. Global remodeling was measured by matrix contraction. Our observations show that no direct relationship occurs between protrusion and retraction of cell extensions and collagen matrix remodeling. As fibroblasts globally remodel the collagen matrix, however, their overall morphology changes from dendritic to stellate/bipolar, and cell–matrix interactions mature from punctate to focal adhesion organization. The less well organized sites of cell–matrix interaction are sufficient for translocating collagen fibrils, and focal adhesions only form after a high degree of global remodeling occurs in the presence of growth factors. Rho kinase activity is required for maturation of fibroblast morphology and formation of focal adhesions but not for translocation of collagen fibrils.","",""

This study examined some of the more popular microscopic traffic simulation models, CORSIM, SimTraffic, and VISSIM, and investigated the variations in the performance measures generated by these models. The study focused on the capacity and delay estimates at a signalized intersection. The effects of link length, speed, and vehicle headway generation distribution were also investigated. With regard to variations in performance measures, the study found that CORSIM yields the lowest variations, whereas SimTraffic yields the highest. The highest variation in each simulation model normally occurs when the traffic demand approaches capacity. It was also found that delays are affected by the link length and speed in simulation models. Such an impact on delays is closely related to the range of speed variations. In general, shorter links and higher link speeds result in lower delays. There is no strong evidence that the headway distribution used to generate vehicles in the simulated network has any effect on capacity and delay estimates. Multiple simulation runs are necessary to achieve an accurate estimate on the true system performance measures. With a 10% error range in estimated delay, two to five runs may be enough for under-capacity conditions, but more than 40 multiple runs may be necessary to accurately estimate delay at, near, or over capacity.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/1802-04",""

For unmodified binders, both of these procedures do a reasonable job of duplicating this aging not only with respect to physical property changes in the binder but also with respect to oxidation, as measured by changes in the infrared absorption spectrum. For modified binders, however, significant difficulties exist, among them surface skin formation and poor flow in the bottles. A new apparatus specifically designed to age modified binders as well as unmodified binders has been developed. This apparatus consists of a temperature-controlled vessel, a tube for introducing either nitrogen or air, a dispersing impeller for mixing the air and binder, and a condenser for collecting volatiles. Besides temperature, gas flow rate and mixing speed are controlled to desired values. The collection of volatiles allows a direct, rather than indirect, measure of volatiles loss. The required aging time of 30 min is less than the RTFOT’s 85 min. Tests of the process with unmodified binders achieved excellent comparisons with RTFOT aging in both physical properties (dynamic shear rheometer) and oxidative aging (Fourier-transform infrared analysis). Trials with modified binders achieved uniform aging with no complications caused by the rheology of these materials. Modified binders studied included polymer-modified styrene butadiene diblock copolymer and styrene butadiene triblock copolymer materials.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/1810-04",""

It is found that the ensemble average correlation time obtained from the single molecule experiments is the same as that obtained from bulk fluorescence anisotropy decay. Both reflect the same underlying dynamics as the mechanically measured α relaxation. Fitting α relaxation and PHB data to the Vogel–Tammann–Fulcher (VTF) equation, it is found that the two measurements follow the same temperature dependence, but with absolute times that differ by nearly four orders of magnitude. This difference is discussed in two contexts. In the first the relative ratio of the correlation and α-relaxation times depend on probe size, in which case the large difference is not unexpected given the size of the probe. In the second, the difference is attributed to specific probe/polymer interactions. In this case, a modified VTF equation that includes an activation energy term can be used to explain this phenomenon; when all parameters but the activation energy are fixed to the α-relaxation values, it is found that an activation energy of 21 KJ/mol could cause the observed slowing of the rhodamine 6G rotational correlation times.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/116/13/5850/19695549/5850_1_1.1456034.pdf",""

In this study, we have examined the effects of activation of the PKA cascade on the responses of spinothalamic tract (STT) neurons to peripheral mechanical stimuli in anesthetized and paralyzed monkeys. PKA in the spinal cord was activated by intra-spinal infusion of forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, by microdialysis. There was a consistent increase in responses to mechanical pressure and pinch stimuli in all STT cells tested when forskolin was administered. Enhanced responses remained at relatively high levels when forskolin had been washed out for 30 min. However, in most STT cells tested (65%), the responses to brushing stimuli were not obviously changed when forskolin was given. Background activity was slightly increased when forskolin was administered. An inactive isomer of forskolin,d-forskolin, did not produce significant effects on cellular activity. The sensitization of STT cells to noxious mechanical stimuli produced by forskolin could be blocked by pretreatment of the spinal cord with the PKA inhibitor, N-[2-(( p-bromocinnamyl)amino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamine (H89). The same dose of H89 did not affect the enhanced responses to mechanical stimuli produced by activation of protein kinase G by intra-spinal infusion of 8-bromo-cGMP, indicating that the effect of forskolin was selective. The present data suggest that activation of PKA can preferentially enhance the responses of STT cells to noxious mechanical stimuli without producing an increase in responses to innocuous brushing stimuli. We speculate that the PKA signal transduction cascade may contribute more to secondary mechanical hyperalgesia than to secondary mechanical allodynia.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jn.2002.88.1.214",""

Exercise has been used successfully to improve PF in other populations exhibiting a compromised PF such as in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Yet, whether exercise training will induce improvements in PF in burned children is presently unknown. We therefore evaluated if an exercise program improved PF in severely burned children (BC). Twenty healthy controls, nonburn children (NB) age 7 to &lt;18 and 31 severely burned children; ages 7 to &lt;18 years old, with greater than 40% of total body surface area burned were enrolled in the study. Burned children were randomized into two groups. One to participate in a 12-week in-hospital physical rehabilitation program supplemented with an exercise-training program (REX, n = 17) and the other nonexercising group (R, n = 14) to participate in a 12-week, home-based physical rehabilitation program without exercise. Pulmonary function tests were performed for all groups at baseline, but only the REX and R groups were tested after 12 weeks of either exercise or no exercise. Baseline PF for the NB group was normal and no differences in PF were found between the R vs REX groups. However, PF was decreased in BC compared to NB children. There was a significant improvement in PF in the REX group. In contrast, PF in the R group remained relatively unchanged. Severely burned children improve PF as a result of an exercise program and such should be a fundamental component of a multidisciplinary outpatient treatment program for victims of thermal injury.","https://academic.oup.com/jbcr/article-pdf/23/4/288/24047743/00004630-200207000-00013.pdf",""

Long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) in the perforant path projections to the dentate gyrus is well characterized. However, surprisingly few studies have addressed the mechanisms underlying LTP induction in the direct perforant path projections to the hippocampus. Here we investigate the role of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and opioid receptors in the induction of LTP in monosynaptic medial and lateral perforant path projections to the CA3 region in adult pentobarbital sodium–anesthetized rats. Similar to LTP observed at the medial perforant path–dentate gyrus synapse, medial perforant path–CA3 synapses display LTP that is blocked by both local and systemic administration of the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist (±)-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl) propyl-1-phosphonic acid [(±)-CPP]. By contrast, LTP induced at the lateral perforant path–CA3 synapses is not blocked by either local or systemic administration of this NMDA receptor antagonist. The induction of LTP at lateral perforant path–CA3 synapses, which is blocked by the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone, is also blocked by the selective mu (μ) opioid receptor antagonist Cys","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jn.00938.2000",""

Here we report such data from the protein-coding region of xanthine dehydrogenase (Xdh) in 22 species of Drosophila. Many of our samples were from closely related species, allowing us to confidently assign substitutions to individual lineages. Surprisingly, Xdh appears to be fixing more A/T mutations than G/C mutations in most lineages, leading to evolution of higher A/T content in the recent past. We found no compelling evidence for selection on protein variation, though some aspects of the data support the notion that a significant fraction of amino acid polymorphisms are slightly deleterious. Finally, we found no convincing evidence that levels of silent heterozygosity are associated with rates of protein evolution.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/162/4/1725/42049001/genetics1725.pdf",""

A 152-kb bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone from sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) encoding phytochrome A (PHYA) was fully sequenced, revealing 16 open reading frames with a gene density similar to many regions of the rice (Oryza sativa) genome. The sequences of genes in the orthologous region of the maize (Zea mays) and rice genomes were obtained using the gene-island sequencing method. BAC clones containing the orthologous maize and ricePHYA genes were identified, sheared, subcloned, and probed with the sorghum PHYA-containing BAC DNA. Sequence analysis revealed that approximately 75% of the cross-hybridizing subclones contained sequences orthologous to those within the sorghum PHYA BAC and less than 25% contained repetitive and/or BAC vector DNA sequences. The complete sequence of four genes, including up to 1 kb of their promoter regions, was identified in the maize PHYA BAC. Nine orthologous gene sequences were identified in the rice PHYA BAC. Sequence comparison of the orthologous sorghum and maize genes aided in the identification of exons and conserved regulatory sequences flanking each open reading frame. Within genomic regions where micro-colinearity of genes is absolutely conserved, gene-island sequencing is a particularly useful tool for comparative analysis of genomes between related species.","http://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-pdf/130/4/1614/38692109/plphys_v130_4_1614.pdf",""

Furthermore, we propose a simple model that helps to clarify the variety of inconsistent results obtained by optical absorption measurements. When the results of photoluminescence and photoreflectance are inserted into this model, we obtain good agreement with our measured optical absorption results.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/91/3/1219/19198158/1219_1_online.pdf",""

Our goal was to determine the role of Src-family kinases (Src) in neutrophil-mediated venular hyperpermeability and possible interactions between Src and endothelial barrier components. We found that inhibition of Src abolished the increases in albumin permeability caused by C5a-activated neutrophils in intact, perfused coronary venules, as well as in cultured endothelial monolayers. Activated neutrophils increased Src phosphorylation at Tyr416, which is located in the catalytic domain, and decreased phosphorylation at Tyr527 near the carboxyl terminus, events consistent with reports that phosphorylating and transforming activities of Src are upregulated by Tyr416 phosphorylation and negatively regulated by Tyr527 phosphorylation. Furthermore, neutrophil stimulation resulted in association of Src with the endothelial junction protein β-catenin and β-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation. These phenomena were abolished by blockage of Src activity. Taken together, our studies link for the first time neutrophil-induced hyperpermeability to a pathway involving Src kinase activation, Src/β-catenin association, and β-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation in the microvascular endothelium.","https://journals.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpcell.00230.2002",""
