In this article, results are presented for a new type of calixarene molecule to be used as an electron beam resist. The molecule differs from previous calixarene resists through the use of bridging groups to limit its conformational mobility and by having only a partial functionalization of the available phenol units with allyl groups to enhance the resist sensitivity. Both the sensitivity and contrast of the calixarene were measured. The measured contrast was found to be 4, while the sensitivity was 3.6mC∕cm2 which is comparable to other fully functionalized calix[6]arene resists. A closer comparison of this calixarene with similar calixarenes indicates that the measured sensitivity is better than would be expected for this partially functionalized molecule and that full functionalization might not be necessary to obtain a significant benefit from the functional groups.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-pdf/23/5/1998/16101302/1998_1_online.pdf",""

In general, the objective of this laboratory study was to investigate the process of initiation, detection, and recovery of inadvertent slips and falls. We examined the initiation of and recovery from foot slips among three age groups utilizing biomechanical parameters, muscle strength, and sensory measurements. Forty-two young, middle-age, and older participants walked around a walking track at a comfortable pace. Slippery floor surfaces were placed on the track over force platforms at random intervals without the participants' awareness. Results indicated that younger participants slipped as often as the older participants, suggesting that the likelihood of slip initiation is similar across all age groups; however, older individuals? recovery process was much slower and less effective. The ability to successfully recover from a slip (thus preventing a fall) is believed to be affected by lower extremity muscle strength and sensory degradation among older individuals. Results from this research can help pinpoint possible intervention strategies for improving dynamic equilibrium among older adults.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1518/001872005775571014",""

Peason Ridge is part of the Fort Polk military training facility. We used multivariate analyses to test the effects of physical variables (i.e., current velocity, depth, and substrate), time (seasonal variability), drainage basin, and military training activities on assemblage structure. Tributaries of the Red River had the highest gradient and were predominated by shallow, swift‐flowing runs with sandy substrates. Southern tributaries of the Calcasieu and Sabine rivers were of lower stream gradient and contained deep, sluggish runs and pools with large amounts of woody debris and silt. Fish assemblages were structured primarily by military training and drainage basin. Faunal differences among drainage basins probably reflect differences in stream gradient. Fish assemblages in tributaries of the Sabine River were less diverse and showed evidence of historical degradation. Macroinvertebrate assemblages also were structured primarily by military training but had a strong seasonal component related to their short life cycles and high seasonal turnover. In contrast to fishes, macroinvertebrate assemblages were similar among drainages. Because military training was most intense in the Red River basin, its significance in these models probably represents differences in stream gradient among the basins because we found no negative effect on stream biota resulting from current training activities. Rather, historical logging and the resultant siltation coupled with isolation of populations by reservoirs are probable explanations for the changes in fish assemblages in tributaries of the Sabine River.","https://afspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1577/FT03-106.1",""

These changes were measured as the negative deflector plate voltage varied from 0 to −800V. The largest ion flux resulted with a −100V setting, while the greatest ion energies occurred with −200V. Deflector plate voltages more negative than −300V resulted in a significant reduction in both the ion flux and ion energy. The damage caused by these ions was determined by measuring the pre- and postanneal photoluminescence properties of Ga0.8In0.2N0.01As0.99 quantum wells. Comparable optical properties were possible with various combinations of ion fluxes and ion energies, which demonstrate how the ion flux and ion energy each impart an individual effect on the sample’s optical properties.

To develop the weight of part features and retrieve a similar part design, the research proposes using Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to learn the optimum feature weight and employing nearest-neighbor technique to measure the similarity of assembly part design.

Meta-analytic estimates of attitude-behavior correlations served to quantify these moderating effects. The present results indicated that the mean attitude-behavior correlation was .41 when people experienced a mean level of social pressure to perform a behavior of mean difficulty.

Spectra are acquired over the photon energy range of 18⩽hν⩽55eV. There are three single-channel resonances in this range, two in the 7σ→kσ channel and one in the 7σ→kπ channel. Vibrational branching ratio curves are determined by measuring vibrationally resolved photoelectron spectra as a function of photon energy, and theoretical branching ratio curves are generated via Schwinger variational scattering calculations. In the region 30⩽hν⩽40eV, there are two shape resonances (kσ and kπ). The kσ ionization resonance is clearly visible in vibrationally resolved measurements at hν=35eV, even though the total cross section in this channel is dwarfed by the cross section in the degenerate, more slowly varying 7σ→kπ channel. This kσ resonance is manifested in non-Franck–Condon behavior in the approximately antisymmetric ν3 stretching mode, but it is not visible in the branching ratio curve for the approximately symmetric ν1 stretch. The behavior of the 35-eV kσ resonance is compared to a previously studied N2O 7σ→kσ shape resonance at lower energy. The mode sensitivity of the 35-eV kσ resonance is the opposite of what was observed for the lower-energy resonance. The contrasting mode-specific behavior observed for the high- and low-energy 7σ→kσ resonances can be explained on the basis of the “approximate” symmetry of the quasibound photoelectron resonant wave function, and the contrasting behavior reflects differences in the continuum electron trapping. An examination of the geometry dependence of the photoelectron dipole matrix elements shows that the kσ resonances have qualitatively different dependences on the individual bond lengths. The low-energy resonance is influenced only by changes in the end-to-end length of the molecule, whereas the higher-energy resonance depends on the individual N–N and N–O bond lengths. Branching ratios are determined for several vibrational levels, including the symmetry-forbidden bending mode, and all of the observed behavior is explained in the context of an independent particle, Born–Oppenheimer framework.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.1946738/15369307/014307_1_online.pdf",""

However, current research has failed to explore how self-confidence with using the Internet impacts a consumer’s willingness to provide personal information online. Therefore, this chapter reports findings from an online consumer panel survey designed to investigate how perceived Internet confidence influences consumer attitudes toward divulging personal information and their willingness to comply with data requests online (n=500). The results largely support the notion that enhancing Internet confidence can lead to more favorable attitudes toward information requests and increased willingness to provide information.","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=4775",""

This article provides a review of major findings from two recent nonmetropolitan studies using survey data from 1,125 citizens nested in 31 nonmetropolitan residential units (RUs) located in the state of Michigan. Hierarchical linear modeling results provide empirical evidence that the differential ability of nonmetropolitan Michigan residents to realize mutual trust and solidarity (i.e., social cohesion) is a major source of RU variation in citizens’ perceived incivility and burglary. Toward this end, several policy recommendations are endorsed in nonmetropolitan communities, whereby resources of social capital can help facilitate collective efficacy for the purpose of social control and improvement of citizen quality of life. Using a social capital framework is likely to benefit rural researchers and policy makers alike.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0887403404271247",""

The natural conformability of biaxial braided tubes makes it the ideal preform for three-dimensional complex components. Braid tube fits on complex components with ease just like pulling socks on feet. Thus cutting, stitching, or manipulation of fiber placement is not needed, as in the use of woven fabrics. Biaxial braided composites find applications in aerospace, automotive, construction, medical, and recreational industry. Some of the products are automobile cross beams, lamp and utility poles, prosthetic limbs, hockey sticks, baseball bats, and bicycle components. Vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) is a low-cost manufacturing process with the capability of manufacturing complex parts with higher fiber volume fractions than those from hand lay-up. To utilize the braided composites to the fullest advantage (and hence to avoid underutilization), it is necessary to understand their behavior under flexural, impact, and fatigue loading. Flexural loading is dominant in the above-mentioned applications of braided composites. This research addresses the effect of braid angle on flexural behavior and failure mechanisms of biaxial braided composites manufactured using VARTM.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2005-81324/2637426/125_1.pdf",""

Elastic fibers in the dermis of animals with single, primary hair follicles are derived from cells lining the hair follicle or from the ends of the pili muscle, which anchors the muscle to the matrix or to the hair follicle. Each follicle is interconnected with elastic fibers. Follicles of animals with primary and secondary (wool) hair follicles are also interconnected by elastic fibers, yet only the elastic fibers derived from the primary follicle are connected to each primary follicle. Only the primary hair follicles are connected to the pili muscle. Human skin, but not the skin of other primates, is significantly different from other animals with respect to elastic fiber organization and probably cell of origin.

Tribological characteristics and mechanical properties of as-electrodeposited Ni microbearings, annealed Ni microbearings at 800°C, and W–C:H coated microbearings were investigated.

Couples described two thematic processes of resilience that helped thwart the effects of cultural marginalization. Relational resiliency, which served to safeguard and protect couples against stressors, consisted of the subthemes of mutuality, relational balance, and interdependence. Couple resilience, processes that facilitated couples overcoming and rebounding from adversity, included subthemes of couple unification, determination, perspective, and external buffers.

Previous genetic studies suggest that mutations in the E2 envelope glycoprotein allow relatively viremia-incompetent, enzootic subtype ID strains to adapt for equine replication, leading to VEE emergence. To test this hypothesis directly, chimeric VEEV strains containing the genetic backbone of enzootic subtype ID strains and the partial envelope glycoprotein genes of epizootic subtype IC and IAB strains, as well as reciprocal chimeras, were used for experimental infections of horses. Insertion of envelope genes from two different, closely related enzootic subtype ID strains into the epizootic backbones resulted in attenuation, demonstrating that the epizootic envelope genes are necessary for the equine-virulent and viremia-competent phenotypes. The partial epizootic envelope genes introduced into an enzootic ID backbone were sufficient to generate the virulent, viremia-competent equine phenotype. These results indicate that a small number of envelope gene mutations can generate an equine amplification-competent, epizootic VEEV from an enzootic progenitor and underscore the limitations of small animal models for evaluating and predicting the epizootic phenotype.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.79.14.9128-9133.2005",""

Understanding the patterns of the spatial association between crime locations and their corresponding crime-related locations (for example, the residence location of an offender or that of a victim) can enhance our capability to explain and predict crime patterns. GIS technologies coupled with spatial statistics have been widely used to model areas of high crime (that is, crime hot spot). But very limited effort has been spent to investigate the spatial association between crime locations from a crime hot spot and the corresponding crime-related locations. This chapter introduces the concept of “hot link” to describe the spatial autocorrelation of the one-to-one relationship between a crime location and a crime-related location. It develops an approach for the hot link analysis problem. Related techniques are applied to the hot link analysis between auto theft and recovery locations in the city of Buffalo, New York. Identifying the patterns of hot links from auto theft locations to recovery locations is important for understanding auto thieves’ travel behavior. Related findings can contribute to the law enforcement’s effort to fight against auto theft. The hot link analysis method can be easily extended to analyzing spatial patterns of other types of crime and crime-related locations.","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=18828",""

Neither mechanism is likely to occur at regular locations on the bed. Measured step spacing was found to follow a Poisson distribution, supporting the conclusion that steps do not develop in preferred or regular locations. This contrasts with previous arguments that regular step spacing develops in response to deposition forced at regular locations beneath water surface waves.

These films possess advantages such as excellent magnetic properties, good corrosion resistance and high chemical stability. Hence, it is imperative that their structural and magnetic properties be characterized so that they can be tailored for specific applications. The present study aims towards the development and characterization of Platinum (Pt)/Cobalt (Co) multilayer films for magnetic and structural properties. Pt/Co multilayered films were deposited on Silicon (Si) substrate using dual electron beam co-evaporation. Four layers of each Pt and Co were deposited on a Si substrate, forming a multilayer film. Controlled deposition rates were used in order to attain the desired thickness of Co and Pt layers. The films were characterized using scanning and transmission electron microscopy and surface profilometry. Magnetic property measurements were conducted on these films in both perpendicular and parallel orientations, in order to understand the correlation between structure of various constituent elements of the film and their magnetic behavior. Results are analyzed and compared with those obtained from previous studies on similar multilayer films, to gain a better understanding of the effect of various parameters on properties of the film.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2005-82348/4555483/497_1.pdf",""

In the model, contextual ethical beliefs represent the mechanism through which individuals' general ethical beliefs impact tax compliance behavior. The model is tested using participants' ethical orientations as measures of their general ethical beliefs and using participants' ethical evaluations of others' tax compliance decisions as measures of their contextual ethical beliefs. Tax compliance behavior is inferred from participants' estimates of the likelihood that they would evade. Overall, the findings from our study support the proposed model. Ethical orientations are directly related to ethical evaluations; ethical evaluations directly predict tax compliance behavior; and finally, ethical orientations are indirectly related to tax compliance behavior. That is, ethical orientations influence tax compliance behavior, but only through their influence on ethical evaluations. We believe that the proposed model provides an important contribution by providing a framework that outlines the routes through which ethical beliefs impact tax compliance.","https://publications.aaahq.org/jata/article-pdf/27/1/39/66418/jata_2005_27_1_39.pdf",""

The portion of SR-20 within the park was constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in the mid-1930s. As part of this work, the CCC built a stone masonry bollard and log rail system to delineate the edge of the road and prevent early-model vehicles from leaving the roadway. Because of their age, quality of workmanship, and importance to the surroundings, the park's bridges and log rail are eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. Previous attempts to replace this rail with a crashworthy system were unsuccessful because of the concern that the aesthetic and historic integrity of the park be preserved. A new approach adopted by the Washington State Department of Transportation began with understanding the context of the highway and the concerns of the other stakeholders. In addition, the stakeholders were educated on the safety issues. As a result, a solution was developed and was acceptable to all. The primary solution involved the development of a new barrier that replicated the appearance of the original log rail. This barrier was crash tested in accordance with NCHRP Report 350 TL-2 criteria and is available for use at other locations at which an aesthetic barrier is desired.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0361198105190400106",""

Wheat leaves with various levels of rust and tan-spot were scanned on a flatbed scanner as TIFF images with a resolution of 8.4 million pixels per image. These images were then progressively reduced in resolution down to 858 pixels per image. The TIFF images were then converted to JPEG images with quality settings of 100, 75, 50, and 25 percent. The percentage of necrotic leaf area was then measured for each image, and correlated with the percentage of necrotic leaf area of the original 8.4 million pixel TIFF images. Image format had little effect on the results and image resolution did not affect results until the image resolution had dropped below the level at which it was difficult to discern lesions by eye. This suggests that low-resolution digital cameras with high JPEG compression levels are suitable for plant disease measurement using image analysis.","https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/pdf/10.1094/PHP-2005-0516-01-RS",""

Benefits from ES use are claimed to be significant and multidimensional, ranging from operational improvements through decision-making enhancement to support for strategic goals (Shang &amp; Seddon, 2002). However, studies (Hanseth &amp; Braa, 2001; Rao, 2000; Robey, Ross, &amp; Boudreau, 2002) of the deployment of ES in private sector organizations show that the ideal is difficult to accomplish. This paper reports a case in which a major university system in the US attempted to develop an in-house enterprise system. The system is currently used by more than 4,000 individual users in almost 20 universities and state agencies. This case offers a historical analysis of the design, implementation and use of the system from its inception in the mid 1980s to the present. This case indicates that ES design and implementation in higher education are quite challenging and complex due to unique factors in the public sector — including state mandates/requirements, IT leadership/resources, value systems, and decentralized organizational structure among other things — that must be taken into account in planning, designing and implementing ES (Ernst, Katz, &amp; Sack, 1994; Lerner, 1999; McCredie, 2000). This case highlights (1) the challenges and issues in the rationale behind “one system for everyone” and (2) some differences as well as similarities in IT management between the private and public sectors. It offers some unique opportunities to discuss issues, challenges and potential solutions for the deployment of ES in the public arena, particularly in higher education.</p>","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=3149",""

This electronic channel is forbidden owing to inversion symmetry selection rules, but it can be accessed when a nonsymmetric vibration is excited, such as bending or antisymmetric stretching. Photoelectron spectra are acquired for photon energies 17⩽hν⩽72eV, and it is observed that the forbidden vibrational transitions are selectively enhanced in the region of a symmetry-forbidden continuum shape resonance centered at hν≈42eV. Schwinger variational calculations are performed to analyze the data, and the theoretical analysis demonstrates that the observed forbidden transitions are due to photoelectron-mediated vibronic coupling, rather than interchannel Herzberg–Teller mixing. We observe and explain the counterintuitive result that some vibrational branching ratios vary strongly with energy in the region of the resonance, even though the resonance position and width are not appreciably influenced by geometry changes that correspond to the affected vibrations. In addition, we find that another resonant channel, 5σu→kπg, influences the symmetric stretch branching ratio.

The objectives of this paper are (1) to develop a trip-distribution model disaggregating journey-to-work data according to type of occupation in order to estimate actual commutes; (2) to develop a disaggregated version of a linear program to measure theoretical minimum and maximum commutes; and, (3) to verify variations in excess commuting and jobs–housing balance according to type of occupation. Results of actual trip-length distributions for each occupation vary from 3.72 to 5 miles for Boise, Idaho, and from 4.27 to 7.78 miles for Wichita, Kansas. Minimum commutes vary from 0.95 to 3.58 miles and from 1.5 to 3.79 miles for Boise and Wichita, respectively. These results imply nonuniform levels of excess commuting and jobs/workers ratios. The proposed models are expected to have a wide range of uses in measurement and assessment of empirical patterns of commuting. The scope of the disaggregation can be extended to other targets, such as different types of industry, household structure, income level, ethnic background, education level, transportation mode, and gender.

Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were measured from 2 groups of school-aged (8–10 years) children. One group consisted of 10 children with LLI, and the other group (control) consisted of 10 children with normally developing language. The ABR was elicited with a brief tone burst presented either alone (no-masking condition) or immediately followed by a longer duration noise burst (backward-masking condition). The primary dependent variable was the latency of wave V of the ABR. The mean latencies were not significantly different for the 2 groups in the no-masking condition. However, in the backward-masking condition, the mean latency for the LLI group was significantly increased relative to the mean latency for the control group. Thus, the presence of successive sounds delay the neural response in children with LLI. The explanation for this delay at the level of the brainstem is not known, but it may be due to disruption of synchrony, activation of alternate (less direct) pathways, increased inhibition, or some combination of these (or other) factors.","http://pubs.asha.org/doi/pdf/10.1044/1092-4388%282005/014%29",""

The spectra are observed in both samples at temperatures between 8K and room temperature. The detailed splitting of individual multiplet manifolds, LJ2S+1, Er3+(4f11), by the crystalline electric field is similar in both the ceramic sample and the single-crystal laser rod. With few exceptions, there is little shift in energy (few wave numbers) of individual Stark levels within a manifold, between dilute and concentrated Er3+ samples. This is not too surprising since Y3Al5O12 and Er3Al5O12 form a solid solution with the majority of Er3+ ions occupying cation sites having D2 symmetry in the garnet lattice over the entire solid solution range. As a check on the observed manifold splittings of Er3+ in ceramic YAG, we compared the present results to the calculated splitting that several of us reported earlier for Er3+ in single-crystal YAG. To within the standard deviation reported earlier, the present results agree with that calculation. Thus, one set of atomic and crystal-field parameters describes the splitting of the Er3+ energy levels in either the ceramic or single-crystal host for Er3+ in D2 sites.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.1861148/14946664/063519_1_online.pdf",""

Since the heat loads of data processing equipment continues to increase at a rapid rate, it is a challenge to maintain the temperature within the requirements as stated for all the racks within the data center. A facility manager has discretion in deciding the data center room layout, but a wrong decision will eventually lead to equipment failure. There are many complex decisions to be made early in the design as the data center evolves. Challenges occur such as optimizing the raised floor plenum, floor tile placement, minimizing the data center local hot spots etc. These adjustments in configuration affects rack inlet air temperatures which is one of the important key to effective thermal management. In this paper, a raised floor data center with 4.5 kW racks is considered. There are four rows of racks with alternating hot and cold aisle arrangement. Each row has six racks installed. Two CRAC units supply chilled air to the data center through the pressurized plenum. Effect of plenum depth, floor tile placement and ceiling height on the rack inlet air temperature is discussed. Plots will be presented over the defined range. Now a multi-variable approach to optimize data center room layout to minimize the rack inlet air temperature is proposed. Significant improvement over the initial model is shown by using multi-variable design optimization approach. The results of multi-variable design optimization are used to present guidelines for optimal data center performance.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/InterPACK/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IPACK2005-73027/4532319/33_1.pdf",""

For this purpose, a two-dimensional cohesive-layer constitutive model with a prescribed traction-separation law is constructed from fundamental principles of continuum mechanics and thermodynamics, taking into account strain-dependent, non-Fickian hygrothermal effects as well as diffusion-induced degradation in the cohesive layer. In the interest of solution tractability, a simplified approach is employed where the rate-dependent behavior in the cohesive layer is implemented through the characterization of rate dependence of the maximum stresses and maximum strains in the cohesive layer, rather than through the use of convolution integrals in the free-energy definition. The remainder of the polymeric adhesive outside the cohesive layer is modeled as a nonlinear viscoelastic continuum with time-dependent constitutive behavior. The influence of temperature and moisture concentration on the work-of-separation and on crack growth is derived from first principles. The model is implemented in a test-bed finite element code. Results predicted by the computational model are benchmarked through comparison to experimental data from mixed-mode fracture experiments performed using a moving wedge test.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/materialstechnology/article-pdf/128/1/11/6732568/11_1.pdf",""

The process focuses on the hunting behavior of the offender within the context of the crime sites and their spatial relationships. Rather than pinpointing a single location, it provides an optimal search strategy by making inferences from the locations and geometry of the connected crime sites. Geographic profiling can therefore be thought of as a spatially based information management tool for serial crime investigation. Tools based on geographic information systems (GIS), such as the Rigel geographic profiling system, allow the rapid computation and visualization of the geographic profile as a three-dimensional probability surface, which can then be combined with other geographically based information to narrow the offender search parameters for the criminal investigator.","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=18819",""

As-deposited SiCF film composition was analyzed by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Surface modification of SiCF films utilizing n-lithiodiaminoethane wet chemical treatment is discussed. Sessile water-drop contact angle changed from 95°±2° before treatment to 32°±2° after treatment, indicating a change in the film surface characteristics from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. For x-ray irradiation on the SiCF film with a dose of 27.4kJ∕cm3, the contact angle of the sessile water drop changed from 95°±2° before radiation to 39°±3° after x-ray exposure. The effect of x-ray exposure on chemical bond structure of SiCF films is studied using Fourier transform infrared measurements. Electroless Cu deposition was performed to test the applicability of the surface modified films.

The motivation is to borrow strength across clinical studies in which the same measurements are collected at different frequencies. Key features of the data are heterogeneous populations and an unbalanced design across three studies of interest. The first two studies are phase I studies with very detailed observations on a relatively small number of patients. The third study is a large phase III study with over 1500 enrolled patients, but with relatively few measurements on each patient. Patients receive different doses of several drugs in the studies, with the phase III study containing significantly less toxic treatments. Thus, the main challenges for the analysis are to accommodate heterogeneous population distributions and to formalize borrowing strength across the studies and across the various treatment levels. We describe a hierarchical extension over suitable semiparametric longitudinal data models to achieve the inferential goal. A nonparametric random-effects model accommodates the heterogeneity of the population of patients. A hierarchical extension allows borrowing strength across different studies and different levels of treatment by introducing dependence across these nonparametric random-effects distributions. Dependence is introduced by building an analysis of variance (ANOVA) like structure over the random-effects distributions for different studies and treatment combinations. Model structure and parameter interpretation are similar to standard ANOVA models. Instead of the unknown normal means as in standard ANOVA models, however, the basic objects of inference are random distributions, namely the unknown population distributions under each study. The analysis is based on a mixture of Dirichlet processes model as the underlying semiparametric model.","https://academic.oup.com/jrsssc/article-pdf/54/3/611/50016845/jrsssc_54_3_611.pdf",""

Propositions are developed concerning how these cultural dimensions would be expected to influence leadership perception processes.

This study evaluated acceptability, impact on satisfaction with care and on quality of life (QOL) of a brief (5–7 minute) semi-structured exploration of spiritual/religious concerns. Patients and Methods:: 118 consecutive patients of four oncologist-hematologists (95% recruitment; 55.1% female, 91.5% Caucasian, 81.3% Christian) with mixed diagnoses, duration (51.7% diagnosed within 2 years) and prognosis (54.2% in active treatment) were alternately assigned to receive the intervention or usual care during an office visit. Assessment occurred just prior to the visit, immediately after, and after 3 weeks. Measures included the FACT-G QOL and FACIT-Sp (Spiritual Well-Being) Scales; BSI Depression Scale; the PCAS Interpersonal and Communication scales; and ratings of acceptability. Results:: Oncologists rated themselves as comfortable during the inquiry with 85% of patients. Of patients, 76% felt the inquiry was “somewhat” to “very” useful. At 3 weeks, the intervention group had greater reductions in depressive symptoms ( F = 7.57, p < .01), more improvement in QOL ( F = 4.04, p < .05), and an improved sense of interpersonal caring from their physician ( F = 4.79, p < .05) relative to control patients. Effects on QOL remained after adjusting for other variables, including relationship to physician. Improvement on Functional Well-being was accounted for primarily by patients lower on baseline spiritual well-being (beta = .293, p < .001). Conclusions:: This study supports the acceptability of a semi-structured inquiry into spiritual concerns related to coping with cancer; furthermore, the inquiry appears to have a positive impact on perception of care and well-being.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2190/8AE4-F01C-60M0-85C8",""

It also evaluates the effects of firm size and information environment on such relationship. By employing a firm-specific abnormal accrual estimation design to measure accounting flexibility/discretion used to adjust abnormal accruals in financial reporting, the study documents that institutional stock ownership is inversely related to such accounting discretion exercised to manage abnormal current accruals. This inverse relationship is, however, found to be dependent on firm size and richness of information environment. Specifically, the inverse relationship strongly holds for smaller firms that are deemed to have an impoverished information environment compared with larger firms having information-rich environment. Furthermore, by using a two-stage least-squares approach, the study addresses the endogeneity-driven ambiguity which is inherent in the simple identification of a negative relation between institutional stock ownership and accrual management. The analysis demonstrates that the overall negative relationship is partly attributed to institutional shareholder monitoring that constrains management's ability to opportunistically manage abnormal accruals. The evidence is consistent with the view that active monitoring of institutional shareholders mitigates opportunistic reporting behavior of corporate managers and improves the quality of governance in the financial reporting process.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0148558X0502000304",""

Some research has shown that MLE and EAP perform equally well under certain conditions in polytomous CAT systems, such that they match the actual latent trait distribution. However, little research has compared these methods when prior estimates of. distributions are extremely poor. In general, it appears that MLE, EAP, and WLE procedures perform equally well when using an optimal item pool.

Direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the fully developed turbulent channel flow was performed at Reynolds number of 200 based on the wall-shear velocity and the channel half-width by using spectral methods. For the first objective, four different grids were applied to the same computational domain and the biggest impact was observed on the logarithmic law of mean velocity profiles and on the amount of drag reduction with 28.3% for the coarsest mesh and 35.4% for the finest mesh. Other turbulence features such as RMS velocity fluctuations, RMS vorticity fluctuations, and bursting events were either overpredicted or underpredicted through coarse grids. For the second objective, two different minimal channels and one natural full channel were studied and 3% drag reduction difference was observed between the smallest minimal channel of 39.1% and the natural full channel of 36.2%. In the near-wall region, however, the minimal channel flow did not exhibit significant difference in the mean velocity profiles and other lower-order statistics. Finally, from this systematical study, it showed that the accuracy of DNS depends more on the spanwise resolution, and it also confirmed that a minimal channel model is able to catch key structures of turbulence in the near-wall region but is much less expensive.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/FEDSM/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/FEDSM2005-77231/2627786/223_1.pdf",""

Pharmacologic inhibition and genetic deletion studies showed a marked reduction of tumor development in colon and skin. COX-2 has also been strongly implicated in urinary bladder cancer primarily by studies with nonselective COX- and COX-2-selective inhibitors. We now show that forced expression of COX-2, under the control of a keratin 5 promoter, is sufficient to cause transitional cell hyperplasia (TCH) in 17% and 75% of the heterozygous and homozygous transgenic lines, respectively, in an age-dependent manner. TCH was strongly associated with inflammation, primarily nodules of B lymphocytes; some T cells and macrophage infiltration were also observed. Additionally, transitional cell carcinoma was observed in ∼10% of the K5.COX-2 transgenic mice; no TCH or transitional cell carcinoma was observed in wild-type bladders. Immunohistochemistry for vascular proliferation and vascular endothelial growth factor showed significant increases above that in wild-type urinary bladders. Our results suggest that overexpression of COX-2 is sufficient to cause hyperplasia and carcinomas in the urinary bladder. Therefore, inhibition of COX-2 should continue to be pursued as a potential chemopreventive and therapeutic strategy.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/65/5/1808/2542445/1808-1813.pdf",""

Individual wavebands from the radiometer, as well as vegetative indices calculated from the individual wavebands, were compared with visual disease estimates from two raters at each of two research sites. Visual assessments and radiometric measurements were partially repeated immediately after the first assessment at each site. Precision, as measured by reduced coefficients of variation, was improved for all vegetative indices and individual waveband radiometric measures compared with visual assessments. Visual assessments, near-infrared singlewaveband reflectance values, and four of the six vegetative indices had high treatment F values, suggesting greater sensitivity at discriminating disease severity levels. Reproducibility, as measured by a test-retest method, was high for visual assessments, single-waveband reflectance at 810 nm, and several of the vegetative indices.

We measure S(t), the fraction of nonreacted chains, for polymerizations ranging from Z=5 to Z=800 and capture distances ranging from a=0.1b to a=8b where b is the bond length. Comparison is made with two theoretical approaches. The first is a decoupling approximation used by Wilemski and Fixman to close the relevant master equation [J. Chem. Phys. 58, 4009 (1973); 60, 866 (1974)]. The second approach is the renormalization group arguments of Friedman and O’Shaughnessy [Phys. Rev. Lett 60, 64 (1988); J. Phys. II 1, 471 (1991)]. We find that at long times S(t) decays as a single exponential with rate k∞. The scaled decay rate K=k∞τR appears to approach a constant value independent of the capture distance for very large chains consistent with the predictions of both the renormalization group (RG) and Wilemski–Fixman closure approximation. We extract K*, the long chain limit of K, from the fixed point a=a* where K is independent of Z. K* is larger than both the RG and closure predictions but much closer to the RG result. More convincing evidence for the RG analysis is obtained by comparing the short-time decay of S(t) to long-time results. The RG analysis predicts that dS∕dt should decay as a power law at early times and that the exponent in the power law is related to K by a simple expression with no free parameters. Our simulations find remarkable agreement with this parameter-free prediction even for relatively short chains. We discuss possible experimental consequences of our result.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.1924412/15368431/214909_1_online.pdf",""

Rather than theorizing a linear relationship between economic development and state behavior in militarized conflicts, this article hypothesizes a non-linear relationship where both extreme poverty and prosperity reduce this risk. This occurs because states at an intermediate level of development have both the opportunity and willingness to pursue territorial claims, which makes them most prone to militarized interstate conflicts. The changing orientation of economies from agricultural and extractive activities eventually to service-based economies alters the cost–benefit calculations concerning territorial acquisition. Developed states, more reliant on services for their economic growth, are less likely to push territorial claims, decreasing their involvement in interstate conflict. Meanwhile, the poorest states, although they have more to gain through territorial expansion, have a decreased ability to pursue their objectives through military force. The authors examine all states between 1870 and 1992 at the monadic level of analysis. In general, the statistical analysis confirms the hypotheses. States at an intermediate level of development are most prone to initiate and participate in militarized conflicts, including those over the issue of territory and those that result in battlefield deaths. High levels of economic development mitigate the effects of military power and population growth that increase the risk of interstate violence. This project helps explain why past studies have linked development to both war and peace, as well as suggesting possible flashpoints in the future. Finally, the results also suggest that other models in the literature theorizing linear functions for economic development and conflict are misspecified.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0022343305049664",""

The temperature dependence of both reaction completion rates and photoluminescence redshift rates followed Arrhenius behavior governed by activation energies that increased with solvent molecular weight, in this limited case. In stearic acid and in trioctylphosphine oxide, the typical activation energies were 0.6±0.1 and 0.92±0.26eV∕molecule, respectively.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.1921347/14331247/171915_1_online.pdf",""

Spatial methods are extremely data-intensive, often pulling together information from disparate sources that have been collected for other purposes, such as research, business practice, governmental policy, and law enforcement. Although initially more demanding in regard to data manipulation compared to typical population level methods, the ability to compile and compare data in a spatial framework provides much additional information about human populations that lies beyond typical survey or census research.

These proteins are up-regulated in a number of pathological conditions, including cancers, and may function as transporters of essential factors. Although previous publications have suggested that 24p3 has pro-apoptotic functions, other data are more suggestive of a survival function. The current study was designed to determine whether NGAL is pro- or anti-apoptotic. Apoptosis induced in human adenocarcinoma A549 cells by the 5-lipoxygenase-activating-protein inhibitor MK886, or several celecoxib-derived PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1) inhibitors that are devoid of cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitory activity, was accompanied by a dose- and time-dependent increase of NGAL mRNA levels, as was reported previously with 24p3. A similar induction of NGAL mRNA was observed in human breast cancer MCF7 cells treated with MK886, indicating this was not a cell-specific effect. Treatment of A549 cells with up to 150 μg/106 cells of purified recombinant NGAL protein had no effect on viability, whereas antisera against the full-length NGAL protein induced apoptosis in these cells. The stable overexpression of NGAL in A549 cells had no effect on proliferation or viability. However, the cell death induced by a PDK1 inhibitor was reduced by 50% in NGAL-overexpressing cells. Decreasing NGAL mRNA and protein expression with siRNA (small interfering RNA) in A549 cells increased the toxicity of a PDK1 inhibitor by approx. 45%. These data indicate that, although the induction of NGAL correlates with apoptosis, this induction represents a survival response. Because NGAL is a secreted protein, it may play an extracellular role in cell defence against toxicants and/or facilitate the survival of the remaining cells.","https://portlandpress.com/biochemj/article-pdf/391/2/441/641003/bj3910441.pdf",""

Although the general features of the signal transmission along the cascade are reasonably defined, the mechanisms underlying Raf activation remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that Raf-1 dephosphorylation, primarily at epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced sites, abolishes Raf-1 kinase activity. Using mass spectrometry, we identified five novel in vivo Raf-1 phosphorylation sites, one of which, S471, is located in subdomain VIB of Raf-1 kinase domain. Mutational analyses demonstrated that Raf-1 S471 is critical for Raf-1 kinase activity and for its interaction with mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK). Similarly, mutation of the corresponding B-Raf site, S578, resulted in an inactive kinase, suggesting that the same Raf-1 and B-Raf phosphorylation is needed for Raf kinase activation. Importantly, the naturally occurring, cancer-associated B-Raf activating mutation V599E suppressed the S578A mutation, suggesting that introducing a charged residue at this region eliminates the need for an activating phosphorylation. Our results demonstrate an essential role of specific EGF-induced Raf-1 phosphorylation sites in Raf-1 activation, identify Raf-1 S471 as a novel phosphorylation site critical for Raf-1 and B-Raf kinase activities, and point to the possibility that the V599E mutation activates B-Raf by mimicking a phosphorylation at the S578 site.","",""

In a subset of non-p53 patients with LFS, CHEK2 in chromosome 22q11 has been identified as another predisposing locus. Studying a series of non-p53 LFS kindred, we have shown that there is additional genetic heterogeneity in LFS kindred with inherited predisposition at loci other than p53 or CHEK2. Using a genome-wide scan for linkage with complementing parametric and nonparametric analysis methods, we identified linkage to a region of approximately 4 cM in chromosome 1q23, a genomic region not previously implicated in this disease. Identification ofa third predisposing gene and its underlying mutation(s) should provide insight into other genetic events that predispose to the genesis of the diverse tumor types associated with LFS and its variants.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/65/2/427/2535468/427-431.pdf",""

The overwhelming majority of VHF lightning sources occurred within the leading convective line in a bimodal pattern in the vertical. Assuming that VHF source density maxima were most likely associated with positive charge, then the LDAR II observations suggest that the gross charge structure of the convective region of the MCS was characterized by a tripole with net positive charge centered at 4.5 km AGL (3°C) and 9.5 km AGL (−35°C) and net negative charge centered roughly in the relative minimum of the VHF source density maximum at 7 km AGL (−17°C). A persistent lightning pathway and inferred positive charge zone sloped rearward (by 40–50 km) and downward (by 4–5 km) from the upper VHF source maximum in the convective line, through the transition zone, and into the radar bright band of the stratiform region. In the stratiform region, VHF lightning sources and inferred positive charge were concentrated in three layers centered at 4.5, 6, and 9 km AGL (2°C, −11°C, and −31°C, respectively), consistent with past electric field studies of symmetric LLTS MCSs. Positive cloud‐to‐ground lightning flashes in the stratiform region were initiated in the convective line and followed the slanting pathway from the top of convective cores to the stratiform precipitation, where they were horizontally extensive, layered, and highly branched. The sloping lightning pathway was identical to hypothetical trajectories taken by snow particles. These observations provide further support for the advection of charge on snow along the sloping pathway and the in situ generation of charge in the horizontal lightning layers as primary contributors to electrification and positive lightning production rearward of the convective line.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2003JD004371",""

In order to gain insight into potential mechansims of factor IXa selectivity and its modulation by heparin we undertook an examination of the reactivity of factor IXa with several other Kunitz-type inhibitors: the Kunitz-type inhibitor domain of protease nexin-2 (PN2KPI) and the first two Kunitz-type inhibitor domains of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI K1 and TFPI K2). As expected, factor IXa exhibited remarkable specificity towards these highly-homologous inhibitors and expressed the following order of reactivity: PN2KPI > TFPI K1/K2 > BPTI. Surprisingly, the enhancing effect of heparin (enoxaparin) was limited to factor IXa reactivity with BPTI and was not observed with PN2KPI or TFPI inhibitory domains. This effect of heparin was not due to a simple template or bridging mechanism between factor IXa and BPTI since progressively smaller oligosaccharides (H14, H10, H6) retained function. We performed molecular modeling and molecular dynamic simulation studies that suggested that BPTI residue R39 may sterically clash with the 99 loop region of factor IXa (specifically residue K98). In contrast, the corresponding position in PN2KPI (G39) does not appear to clash with factor IXa residue K98 in modeling studies. In addition, the 99 loop region of factor IXa is in close proximity to the heparin binding site. Thus, based on these observations we hypothesized that factor IXa residue K98 could be restricting occupation of the factor IXa active site, and that this steric hindrance could be partly alleviated by heparin binding. We therefore examined a mutant of factor IXa in which residue K98 was mutated to A. The fIXK98A mutant was expressed as a zymogen in human 293 cells and purified by a combination of ion exchange and heparin affinity chromatography. The fIXK98A mutant exhibited identical procoagulant activity compared to wild-type factor IXa in a standard clotting assay. In addition, upon activation with RVV-X the fIXaK98A enzyme showed similar activity as wild-type factor IXa towards the small peptide substrate CBS 31.39. In sharp contrast, however, examination of the inhibition of fIXaK98A by BPTI showed a dramatic enhancement in inhibition compared to the wild-type enzyme: Ki = 20 μM in the absence of heparin and Ki = 10 μM in the presence of heparin for fIXaK98A; and Ki > 500 μM in the absence of heparin and Ki = 40 μM in the presence of heparin for wild-type factor IXa. We conclude from this that factor IX residue K98 limits access of specific molecules into the active site of factor IXa and protects it from inhibition by BPTI. It would seem that some or all of this interference is alleviated upon heparin binding to factor IXa. The smaller effect of heparin on the mutant enzyme (2-fold) compared to the wild-type enzyme (>10-fold) further supports the supposition that heparin binding to factor IXa may in part be facilitating movement of the 99 loop of factor IXa to enhance access to the active site. This may have implications in the selectivity and reactivity of factor IXa with other inhibitors as well as certain substrates and provides some important insight into factor IXa function.","https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/106/11/1942/137856/Insight-into-Factor-IXa-Selectivity-and-Reactivity",""

A central challenge is development of policies that efficiently and equitably allocate the basin's water resources among competing uses across political and institutional jurisdictions. A basin‐wide, nonlinear programming model optimizes resource allocations and water use levels for the upper part of the Rio Grande Basin to test whether institutional adjustments can reduce damages caused by drought. Compared to existing institutions, we find that future drought damages could be reduced by 20 and 33% per year through intracompact and interstate water markets, respectively, that would allow water transfers across water management jurisdictions.

Life thrived on Earth but may have been severely restricted on Mars. There it could be present today in liquid water in or beneath ice sheets or glaciers, in subterranean aqueous reservoirs, especially in regions of elevated heat flow, or in protected habitats such as lava tubes, caves, or cracks and fissures. The potential for life is enhanced in regions where elevated heat flow may occur, such as in parts of the Tharsis and Elysium volcanic provinces. Possible organisms would be chemoautotrophic psychrophiles adapted to a nutrient‐poor environment or photoautotrophic life in selected near‐surface habitats. Alternatively, life may have evolved alternating cycles between active and dormant forms, in which case microbes could be present in dormant forms close to the surface and in active forms in protected environments.

Forests of Quercus, Ulmus, Corylus and Carpinus existed in the Heraklean Peninsula between 12 ka and 11 ka. The subsequent reduction of arboreal pollen and the expansion of Artemisia and Knautia, in conjunction with chernozem soil development, indicate prevailing steppe conditions between 11 ka and 7.5 ka. An increase in arboreal pollen, dominated by sub-Mediterranean and Mediterranean taxa, and the development of brown cinnamonic (calfersic) soil suggest higher temperatures and summer drought between 7.5 ka and 5 ka. An increase in arboreal pollen and the development of a meadow cinnamonic soil suggest an increase in moisture between 5.4 ka and 4.6 ka. A subsequent decrease in AP and the development of calcic horizons in cinnamonic soils indicate that a dry phase occurred between 4.2 ka and 3.5 ka. Woodland expansion occurred again after 3.2 ka, only to be interrupted by the establishment of Greek farms in the fifth century BC. An increase in AP on or after the first century BC was the result of climatic amelioration in conjunction with farm abandonment prompted by political crisis and steppe warrior raids. Although Holocene pollen and soil records from the Ukrainian steppes present climate trends similar to the Heraklean Peninsula, differences in plant taxa and soil response to climatic changes exist due to their different position with respect to marine influences.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1191/0959683605hl791rp",""

Mice lacking RIM1α and Rab3A have a defect in PKA-dependent and NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-independent presynaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) at hippocampal mossy-fiber and cerebellar parallel-fiber synapses. In contrast, the NMDAR-dependent and PKA-independent early phase of LTP at hippocampal CA3–CA1 synapses does not require these presynaptic proteins. Here, we ask whether Rab3A and RIM1α participate in forms of LTP that require both PKA and NMDAR activation. We find that Rab3A is necessary for corticoamygdala LTP and late-phase LTP at CA3–CA1 synapses, two forms of LTP that require NMDAR and PKA activation. The latter form of LTP also requires RIM1α. These results provide genetic evidence that presynaptic proteins are required in LTP induced through the postsynaptic activation of NMDARs. Thus Rab3A and its effectors are general modules for four distinct types of PKA-dependent LTP in the brain.","https://pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.0503777102",""

It is shown that this local change in the contrast (magnitude) of the piezoresponse from grain to grain can be attributed to the crystallographic orientation within each grain. PFM-based relaxation experiments show that the rate of relaxation is different for each grain, furthermore it is strongly dependent on the tilt of individual crystallographic orientation with respect to the polar axis. Strongly tilted away nonpolar axis grains show a much stronger decay of the polarization compared to polar axis-oriented grains. Therefore, for an ensemble of grains under a common top electrode, the relaxation events would first take place in grains, which are nonpolar axis oriented.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.1977183/13183271/262910_1_online.pdf",""

Perceptual modality preferences are the preferred means by which information is obtained through the senses. Research indicates that perceptual modality preferences are influenced by cultural differences in family socialization, language, educational experiences, traditions, values, and beliefs. Students from South Korea (n = 151), Swaziland (n = 116) and the United States (n = 184) completed the Perceptual Modality Preferences Survey (PMPS).

This hypothesis is tested by examining variability in an atmospheric general circulation model coupled to an ocean mixed layer model subjected to the orbital forcing of the past 165 000 yr. During Northern Hemisphere summer, the model’s response conforms to Milankovitch’s hypothesis, with high (low) insolation generating warm (cold) temperatures throughout the hemisphere. However, during Northern Hemisphere winter, the climate variations stemming from orbital forcing cannot be solely understood as a local thermodynamic response to radiation anomalies. Instead, orbital forcing perturbs the atmospheric circulation in a pattern bearing a striking resemblance to the northern annular mode, the primary mode of simulated and observed unforced atmospheric variability. The hypothesized reason for this similarity is that the circulation response to orbital forcing reflects the same dynamics generating unforced variability. These circulation anomalies are in turn responsible for significant fluctuations in other climate variables: Most of the simulated orbital signatures in wintertime surface air temperature over midlatitude continents are directly traceable not to local radiative forcing, but to orbital excitation of the northern annular mode. This has paleoclimate implications: during the point of the model integration corresponding to the last interglacial (Eemian) period, the orbital excitation of this mode generates a 1°–2°C warm surface air temperature anomaly over Europe, providing an explanation for the warm anomaly of comparable magnitude implied by the paleoclimate proxy record. The results imply that interpretations of the paleoclimate record must account for changes in surface temperature driven not only by changes in insolation, but also by perturbations in atmospheric dynamics.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jcli/article-pdf/18/9/1315/3927674/jcli3327_1.pdf",""

Here, we demonstrate that mitofilin, a previously identified mitochondrial protein of unknown function, controls mitochondrial cristae morphology. Mitofilin is enriched in the narrow space between the inner boundary and the outer membranes, where it forms a homotypic interaction and assembles into a large multimeric protein complex. Down-regulation of mitofilin in HeLa cells by using specific small interfering RNA lead to decreased cellular proliferation and increased apoptosis, suggesting abnormal mitochondrial function. Although gross mitochondrial fission and fusion seemed normal, ultrastructural studies revealed disorganized mitochondrial inner membrane. Inner membranes failed to form tubular or vesicular cristae and showed as closely packed stacks of membrane sheets that fused intermittently, resulting in a complex maze of membranous network. Electron microscopic tomography estimated a substantial increase in inner:outer membrane ratio, whereas no cristae junctions were detected. In addition, mitochondria subsequently exhibited increased reactive oxygen species production and membrane potential. Although metabolic flux increased due to mitofilin deficiency, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation was not increased accordingly. We propose that mitofilin is a critical organizer of the mitochondrial cristae morphology and thus indispensable for normal mitochondrial function.","",""

This reflects recognition of the geomorphic significance of step pools in high-gradient channels, and a growing interest in rivers in mountainous regions in general. This paper synthesizes the recent literature on step pools, with particular reference to theory construction and progress made over the past decade and a half. Four groups of contributions are identified. The first focuses on understanding morphological relations in order to seek causal mechanisms. The second emphasizes processes that result from the step-pool configuration. The third is a group of integrative studies that seek broader explanations for step-pool sequences. The fourth and growing body of literature applies what has been learned about step pools toward managing and restoring steep channels. We conclude by highlighting some future possible research directions toward gaining a complete explanation for step pools in stream channels.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1191/0309133305pp449ra",""

Total FA content was highest or increased during elongation and was lower or decreased thereafter, likely reflecting the assembly of the expanding cell membranes during elongation and the shift to membrane maintenance (and increase in secondary cell wall content) in maturing fibers. Analysis of lipid extracts by electrospray ionization and tandem MS (ESI‐MS/MS) revealed that in elongating fiber cells (7–10 d post‐anthesis), the polar lipids—PC, PE, PI, PA, phosphatidylglycerol, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, digalactosyldiacylglycerol, and phosphatidyl‐glycerol—were most abundant. These same glycerolipids were found in similar proportions in maturing fiber cells (21 dpa). Detailed molecular species profiles were determined by ESI‐MS/MS for all glycerolipid classes, and ESI‐MS/MS results were consistent with lipid profiles determined by HPLC and ELSD. The predominant molecular species of PC, PE, PI, and PA was 34∶3 (16∶0, 18∶3), but 36∶6 (18∶3, 18∶3) also was prevalent. Total FA analysis of cotton lipids confirmed that indeed linolenic (18∶3) and palmitic (16∶0) acids were the most abundant FA in these cell types. Bioinformatics data were mined from cotton fiber expressed sequence tag databases in an attempt to reconcile expression of lipid metabolic enzymes with lipid metabolite data. Together, these data form a foundation for future studies of the functional contribution of lipid metabolism to the development of this unusual and economically important cell type.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1007/s11745-005-1439-4",""

In this study, we found that the introduction of wild-type galectin-3 into nontumorigenic, galectin-3-null BT549 human breast epithelial cells conferred tumorigenicity and metastatic potential in nude mice, and that galectin-3 expressed by the cells was phosphorylated. In contrast, BT549 cells expressing galectin-3 incapable of being phosphorylated (Ser6→Glu Ser6→Ala) were nontumorigenic. A microarray analysis of 10,000 human genes, comparing BT549 transfectants expressing wild-type and those expressing phosphomutant galectin-3, identified 188 genes that were differentially expressed (&gt;2.5-fold). Genes affected by introduction of wild-type phosphorylated but not phosphomutant galectin-3 included those involved in oxidative stress, a novel noncaspase lysosomal apoptotic pathway, cell cycle regulation, transcriptional activation, cytoskeleton remodeling, cell adhesion, and tumor invasion. The reliability of the microarray data was validated by real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and by Western blot analysis, and clinical relevance was evaluated by real-time RT-PCR screening of a panel of matched pairs of breast tumors. Differentially regulated genes in breast cancers that are also predicted to be associated with phospho-galectin-3 in transformed BT549 cells include C-type lectin 2, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 5, cathepsins L2, and cyclin D1. These data show the functional diversity of galectin-3 and suggest that phosphorylation of the protein is necessary for regulation (directly or indirectly) of unique sets of genes that play a role in malignant transformation.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/65/23/10767/2538332/10767-10775.pdf",""

The geochemical maps presented here are based on the graphic representation of spatial variations in geochemical proxies for the principal mantle and subduction components. The focus is on three elements with high and similar partition coefficients but different behavior in subduction systems, namely, Ba, Th, and Nb. Two elements with different partition coefficients, Ta and Yb, are used as normalizing factors. Ratio maps (Ta/Yb, Nb/Ta, Th/Ta, Ba/Ta, Ba/Th) provide the simplest petrogenetic insights, subduction zone addition maps based on deviations from a MORB array provide more quantitative insights, and component maps represent an attempt to isolate the different subduction components. The maps shown here indicate the presence of a variably depleted asthenosphere and three added components: a Nb‐Th‐Ba component, a Th‐Ba deep‐subduction component, and a Ba‐only shallow‐subduction component. The asthenosphere entering the system is enriched relative to N‐MORB and appears to be focused at three sites within the Mariana Trough. The Nb‐Th‐Ba component is present mainly in the north of the arc (the Northern Seamount province and northern Central Island Province), the northern edge of the Mariana Trough, and two locations within the Southern Seamount Province. It has a distinctively high Nb/Ta ratio and a moderate enrichment in Th and Ba relative to Nb. Its composition and distribution indicate that it may not be part of the present subduction system but instead originates in mantle lithosphere previously enriched above the subduction zone by addition of small‐degree, subduction‐modified mantle melts. The Th‐Ba component is present throughout the arc and, in minor amounts, in parts of the back‐arc basin. The Ba‐only component is mainly present in the central part of the arc and at the edges of the back‐arc basin. Overall, the geochemical maps provide a new perspective on the geochemical processes that accompany the evolution of an arc basin system from prerifting lithospheric enrichment, through arc‐rifting to arc volcanism and back‐arc spreading.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2004GC000895",""

Time-course studies established that severe fibrosis was present 7 d after initiation of a continuous sc PTH infusion (40 μg/kg·d). To ascertain cell proliferation, rats were coinfused for 1 wk with PTH (treated) or vehicle (control) and [3H]thymidine (1.5 mCi/rat). Groups of control and treated rats were killed immediately (d 0) and 1 wk (d 7) later. Few osteoblasts (Obs) and osteocytes in treated and control groups were radiolabeled on d 0. Peritrabecular cells expressing a fibroblastic (Fb) phenotype and surrounded by an extracellular matrix were not present in controls on either d 0 or d 7. Multiple cell layers of Fbs lined most (70%) of the bone surface on d 0 in treated rats and nearly all (85%) of the Fbs were radiolabeled. Fbs had entirely disappeared from bone surfaces on d 7. Eighty-five percent of the Obs on and 73% of the osteocytes within the active remodeling sites were radiolabeled. Immunohistochemistry revealed that Fbs induced by PTH treatment produced osteocalcin, osteonectin, and core binding factor-α1. These data provide compelling evidence that Fbs recruited to bone surfaces in response to a continuous PTH infusion undergo extensive proliferation, express osteoblast-specific proteins, and produce an extracellular matrix that is similar to osteoid. After restoration of normal PTH levels, Fbs differentiated to Obs, providing further evidence that Fbs are preosteoblasts.","http://academic.oup.com/endo/article-pdf/146/9/4074/10790680/endo4074.pdf",""

Retrospective radiosurgery (RS) reports found no survival difference when compared with WBRT. Before RS alone was evaluated with delayed WBRT in a phase III trial, the feasibility of RS alone was tested prospectively. Patients and Methods: Patients with renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, or sarcoma; one to three brain metastases; and performance status of 0 to 2 were enrolled. Exclusion criteria were leptomeningeal disease; metastases in medulla, pons, or midbrain; or liver metastases. On the basis of tumor size, patients received 24, 18, or 15 Gy RS. At recurrence, management was discretionary. The primary end point was 3- and 6-month intracranial progression. Results: Between July 1998 and August 2003, 36 patients were accrued; 31 were eligible. Median follow-up was 32.7 months and the median survival was 8.3 months (95% CI, 7.4 to 12.2). Three- and 6-month intracranial failure with RS alone was 25.8% and 48.3%. Failure within and outside the RS volume, when in-field and distant intracranial failures were scored independently, was 19.3% and 16.2% (3 months) and 32.2% and 32.2% (6 months), respectively. Approximately 38% of patients experienced death attributable to neurologic cause. There were three grade 3 toxicities related to RS. Conclusion: Intracranial failure rates without WBRT were 25.8% and 48.3% at 3 and 6 months, respectively. Delaying WBRT may be appropriate for some subgroups of patients with radioresistant tumors, but routine avoidance of WBRT should be approached judiciously.","https://ascopubs.org/doi/pdfdirect/10.1200/JCO.2005.01.8747",""

These deployment types are respectively less genetically variable and less well buffered against environmental stress, but provide respectively greater genetic gains from higher selection intensity. Currently, bulked seed orchard mixes are deployed by all state organizations and many smaller companies, but about half the 1.1 billion loblolly and slash pines deployed annually are planted in half-sib family blocks. The most aggressive landowners plant virtually all of their land with a small number of half-sib families. Full-sib families and/or clones are currently planted on a small fraction of the total area regenerated, but research and development seeks to make the deployment of full-sib families and clones economical to increase the genetic gains from applied tree improvement programs. Resistance to fusiform rust currently being deployed is likely due to resistance based on both major genes and genes of small, cumulative effects. However, major genes for resistance to fusiform rust have been discovered using molecular genetic techniques, and deployment strategies are currently being developed. “Boom and bust” cycles of pathogens on other crops when major genes were deployed against them create concerns that these same problems might arise when deploying major genes for resistance against fusiform rust. We assessed the risk that fusiform rust might overcome one to few major genes for resistance if they are deployed widely and strategies to mitigate the risk that this will occur. We concluded that the deployment strategies currently in widest use (bulked seed orchard seedlings and half-sib family blocks) robustly resist fusiform rust infection. Plantations are probably sufficiently genetically buffered to present little risk of cataclysmic failure, as current resistance is likely to be based on both major and minor genes. Furthermore, these same deployment strategies are likely to provide robust protection against risk factors other than fusiform rust. We concluded that deploying pine cultivars with known genes for major resistance to fusiform rust in regions where their associated virulence genes are absent or in low frequencies is a practical near term strategy and that deploying a mosaic of different resistance genes may mitigate the presumed greater risk of deploying full-sib family blocks or clones.

The single urban category in the existing 24-category U.S. Geological Survey land cover classification used in MM5 was divided into three classes to account for heterogeneity of urban land cover. Updated land cover data were derived from 1998 Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite images. The composition of the urban land use classes in terms of typical fractions of vegetation and anthropogenic surfaces was determined from ground-truth information, allowing a variety of moisture availability for evaporation by land cover class. Bulk approaches for characteristics of the urban surface energy budget, such as heat storage, the production of anthropogenic heat, and radiation trapping, were introduced in MM5’s Medium Range Forecast boundary layer scheme and slab land surface model. A 72-h simulation was performed with MM5 on a 2 km × 2 km grid during June 1998. The new land cover classification had a significant impact on the turbulent heat fluxes and the evolution of the boundary layer and improved the capability of MM5 to simulate the daytime part of the diurnal temperature cycle in the urban area. The nighttime near-surface air temperatures were improved significantly by adding radiation trapping, heat storage, and anthropogenic heating to the model.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jamc/article-pdf/44/9/1281/3296938/jam2286_1.pdf",""

This notion was formalized in Stahl (1989, “Oligopolistic pricing with sequential consumer search,” American Economic Review, Vol. 79, No. 4, pp. 700–712) in a model of static firm competition. In this paper, we show that these standard welfare conclusions may be neutralized or reversed in a dynamic environment. We focus on self-enforcing collusion by firms and characterize the conditions under which collusive equilibria exist. We show that less costly consumer search can facilitate firms' abilities to collude, resulting in higher prices and reduced consumer welfare, even with imperfect or no monitoring by sellers of each other's prices. If the same technology that eases consumer search also allows firms to monitor each other's prices more easily, then firms can more easily detect cheating on a collusive price arrangement, allowing an even greater scope for collusion. This raises antitrust concerns with respect to the electronic marketplace and suggests that at least some of the anticipated competitive gains from electronic market systems may be difficult to realize.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0327",""

Following discussion of the model's contents, we describe its potential value for researchers and those engaging in corporate entrepreneurship.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1540-6520.2005.00104.x",""

However, few studies have focused on students’ opinions of dental school. The purpose of this study was to determine students’ perceptions of the learning environment, intellectual climate, and teacher‐student relationships in dental school. This report describes how the “dental version” of the Medical Student Learning Environment Survey (MSLES) was used to identify students’ perceptions of their dental education. Freshman and junior dental students’ perceptions were measured with the Dental Student Learning Environment Survey (DSLES), which evaluates learning environment, intellectual climate, and relationships among students and teachers in seven areas: flexibility, student‐to‐student interaction, emotional climate, supportiveness, meaningful experience, organization, and breadth of interest. The DSLES was mailed to twenty‐three dental schools in North America with eighteen of the schools distributing the inventory. A total of 619 dental students responded. Results were differentiated between freshman and junior dental students. Both freshman and junior students provided the highest (most positive) ratings for the DSLES subscales of “breadth of interest” (interest in dentistry and outside interests are encouraged) and “meaningful learning experience” (significance of courses to dentistry). Freshman students provided the lowest (least positive) ratings for “emotional climate” (students’ responses to the way their courses were conducted and stress levels), and junior students provided the least positive ratings for “faculty supportiveness” (extent of faculty support and encouragement provided to students). The DSLES identified students’ perceptions of their educational experience and localized areas for improvement. By addressing these areas of concern, faculty can increase student satisfaction with their dental education.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fj.0022-0337.2005.69.10.tb04015.x",""

Traditionally, southern APGR elements have been correlated with those of the northern Appalachians on the basis of gross geological similarities. Most palaeogeographical reconstructions of the APGR are based on data from the northern Appalachians; consequently in these reconstructions, southern APGR elements are viewed commonly either as being affiliated spatially with those of the north or ignored. However, emerging data from two southern Appalachian crustal blocks give new insights into the palaeogeography of the APGR. The Smith River allochthon may be a part of the APGR on the basis of recently obtained U-Pb monazite and staurolite ages that are apparently incompatible with a Laurentian origin. The allochthon and possibly adjacent terranes, appear to have followed a palaeogeographical track independent of other APGR elements. The Carolina zone is recognized as peri-Gondwanan in origin on the basis of its (i) gross geological evolution, (ii) fossil fauna and (iii) tectonic history. Mid-Palaeozoic regional kinematic patterns suggest that Carolina and its commonly held northern counterpart, the Avalon zone, travelled together on the same lithospheric plate, but their contrasting tectonic histories suggest that they formed along different margins of this plate. These interpretations lead to a new model for middle Palaeozoic interactions of the APGR with Laurentia.","https://www.lyellcollection.org/doi/pdf/10.1144/GSL.SP.2005.246.01.03",""

We found that nests attended by male Wood Thrushes had higher success rates (i.e., lower predation rates) than unattended nests in Illinois where Blue Jays were a dominant nest predator. In contrast, there was no significant difference in nest success between attended and unattended nests in New York where rodents (mice and chipmunks) and raptors, such as the Sharp-shinned Hawk, were important predators on nests and adults, respectively. Despite differences in risk to adults and nests between the two sites, the frequency of observing attendant males did not differ between sites.

Ultrastructural and developmental analyses have demonstrated that this biomineralization process is not a simple random physical-chemical precipitation of endogenously synthesized oxalic acid a strong and the simplest dicarboxylic acid, often thought of as a toxin or end product of metabolism, but which is also synthesized when calcium oxalate crystals are induced to form in plants and environmentally derived Ca. Instead, crystals are formed in specific shapes and sizes. Genetic regulation of CaOx formation is indicated by constancy of crystal morphology within species, cell specialization, and the remarkable coordination of crystal growth and cell expansion. Using a variety of approaches, researchers have begun to unravel the exquisite control mechanisms exerted by cells specialized for CaOx formation that include the machinery for uptake and accumulation of Ca, oxalic acid biosynthetic pathways, and regulation of crystal growth.","https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.arplant.56.032604.144106",""

Proline-, glutamic acid–, and leucine-rich protein-1 (PELP1) is a novel coregulator that plays a role in both the genomic and extranuclear actions of estrogen receptors (ER) in hormonally responsive tissues. In this study using breast tumor arrays, we found that PELP1 was localized only in the cytoplasm in 58% of the PELP1-positive breast tumors. To help explain the significance of the cytoplasmic localization of PELP1 in human breast tumors, we created a mutant protein that was expressed only in the cytoplasm (PELP1-cyto) and then generated a model system wherein MCF-7 breast cancer cells were engineered to specifically express this mutant. We found that PELP1-cyto cells were hypersensitive to estrogen but resistant to tamoxifen. PELP1-cyto cells, but not parental MCF-7 cells, formed xenograft tumors in nude mice. In addition, PELP1-cyto cells exhibited increased association of PELP1 with Src, enhanced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, and constitutive activation of AKT. The altered localization of PELP1 was sufficient to trigger the interaction of PELP1 with the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), leading to PI3K activation. In addition, PELP1 interacted with epidermal growth factor receptors and participated in growth factor–mediated ER transactivation functions. Our results suggest that the altered localization of PELP1 modulates sensitivity to antiestrogens, potentiates tumorigenicity, presumably via the stimulation of extranuclear estrogen responses, such as the activation of MAPK and AKT, and also enhance cross-regulation of ER transactivation activity by growth factors.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/65/17/7724/2536483/7724-7732.pdf",""

We previously reported the potential of genistein to augment chemotherapeutic response of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. In the present study, we investigated whether genistein pretreatment could be used as a novel strategy for gemcitabine-induced killing in vitro and enhanced antitumor activity in vivo using an orthotopic tumor model. We conducted our studies using paired isogenic human pancreatic cancer cell line with differences in metastatic behavior (COLO 357 and L3.6pl). In vitro studies were done to measure growth inhibition and degree of apoptotic cell death induced by either genistein alone, gemcitabine alone, or genistein followed by gemcitabine. Our results show that pretreatment of cells with genistein for 24 hours followed by gemcitabine resulted in 60% to 80% growth inhibition compared with 25% to 30% when gemcitabine was used alone. The overall growth inhibition was directly correlated with apoptotic cell death irrespective of the metastatic potential of cells. Several genes that are known to inhibit apoptosis and contribute to chemoresistance such as nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and Akt were assessed to investigate the basis for the observed chemosensitizing effects of genistein. Genistein potentiated the gemcitabine-induced killing by down-regulation of NF-κB and Akt. In contrast, Akt and NF-κB were found to be up-regulated when pancreatic cancer cells were exposed to gemcitabine alone, suggesting the potential mechanism of acquired chemoresistance. In addition to in vitro results, we show here for the first time, that genistein in combination with gemcitabine is much more effective as an antitumor agent compared with either agent alone in our orthotopic tumor model. But most importantly, our data also showed that a specific target, such as NF-κB, was inactivated in genistein-treated animal tumors and that gemcitabine-induced activation of NF-κB was completely inhibited in animal tumors treated with genistein and gemcitabine. These results provide strong molecular in vivo evidence in support of our hypothesis that inactivation of NF-κB signaling pathway by genistein could also abrogate gemcitabine-induced activation of NF-κB resulting in the chemosensitization of pancreatic tumors to gemcitabine, which is likely to be an important and novel strategy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/65/19/9064/2533604/9064-9072.pdf",""

Sun, P. de Sainte Claire, O. Meroueh, and W. L Hase, J. Chem. Phys. 114, 535 (2001)], a classical trajectory simulation was reported of CH4 desorption from Ni{111} by Ar-atom collisions. At an incident angle θi of 60° (with respect to the surface normal), the calculated collision-induced desorption (CID) cross sections are in excellent agreement with experiment. However, for smaller incident angles the calculated cross sections are larger than the experimental values and for normal collisions, θi=0°, the calculated cross sections are approximately a factor of 2 larger. This trajectory study used an analytic function for the Ar+Ni(s) intermolecular potential which gives an Ar–Ni{111} potential energy minimum which is an order of magnitude too deep. In the work reported here, the previous trajectory study is repeated with an Ar+Ni(s) analytic intermolecular potential which gives an accurate Ar–Ni{111} potential energy minimum and also has a different surface corrugation than the previous potential. Though there are significant differences between the two Ar+Ni(s) analytic potentials, they have no important effects on the CID dynamics and the cross sections reported here are nearly identical to the previous values. Zero-point energy motions of the surface and the CH4–Ni(s) intermolecular modes are considered in the simulation and they are found to have a negligible effect on the CID cross sections. Calculations of the intermolecular potential between CH4 and a Ni atom, at various levels of theory, suggest that there are substantial approximations in the ab initio calculation used to develop the CH4+Ni{111} potential. The implication is that the differences between the trajectory and experimental CID cross sections may arise from an inaccurate CH4+Ni{111} potential used in the trajectory simulation.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.1829993/10877170/044704_1_online.pdf",""

A model is required to be able to connect models together in the interface; however, creating such models is time-consuming. This article addresses this deficiency by studying specific ways in which models can be interconnected within the same 3D space through effective ontology construction and human interaction techniques. The authors have developed a method for automatically constructing a human-computer interface model (i.e., which is termed an interaction model) from an ontology for an example physical environment. The work to date has resulted in an environment based on a 3D modeling and animation package, permitting users to explore dynamic model structure through interactions with geometric scene structure.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0037549705064359",""

Specifically, predictive designs may produce results different from those of postdictive designs (which are more commonly used). Furthermore, self-report data appear to include a broader range of incidents (more crashes and tickets), and thus researchers should consider using self-report data when they are interested in including lower threshold crashes and tickets that may not be reported on state records (e.g., because of the completion of a defensive driving course)","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1518/0018720054679416",""

We observe that the effect is consistent with microstructure formation characteristic of directional solidification. The results contribute to increased understanding of SHS combustion mechanisms in thin Ni/Al films, in particular that the combustion temperature exceeds the melting point of all reactants and reaction products, and that the mechanism for formation of reaction products is solidification from a fully molten zone.

To further improve the split cache organization, we augment the scalar cache with a small victim cache and the array cache with a small stream buffer.

These data supported a correlated three-factor model consisting of place identity, place dependence, and social bonding. Multigroup confirmatory factor analysis was used to cross-validate the model using two sub-samples of the data. Latent factor means were also compared. Although these analyses provided mixed evidence indicating the scale to be a valid and reliable measure of place attachment, there remains some concern about the performance of several indicators (i.e., low factor loadings, low reliability). Latent mean differences were also observed between the two groups on the place identity dimension. The analyses presented in this investigation provide an example of the utility of covariance structure analysis for testing the psychometric properties of scales and for comparing latent mean differences among groups within populations.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0013916504269654",""

The extent of penetration through Hf silicate was found to be dependent upon the thermal annealing budget for each dopant investigated as follows: B(T⩾950°C∕60s), P(T⩾1000°C∕20s), and As (T⩾1050°C∕60s). We propose that the enhanced diffusion observed for these dopants in HfSixOy, compared with that of SiO2 films, is related to grain boundary formation resulting from HfSixOy film crystallization. We also find that, as in the case of SiO2, N incorporation inhibits dopant (B, P, and As) diffusion through the Hf silicate and thus penetration into the underlying Si substrate. Only B penetration is clearly observed through HfSiON films for anneals at 1050 °C for durations of 10 s or longer.

During that time, they have been directly or indirectly responsible for much of the remarkable progress in forest productivity seen in the southeastern United States. They have also exported plant material, ideas, and trained professionals to many other parts of the world. These programs, models for collaborative research and development, are now entering a critical period fraught with both promise and peril. Extraordinary progress in both forest genetics and tree improvement is achievable during the next 10 years. Advances in physiology, genomics, and molecular biology provide tools to make rapid improvements in vegetative propagation, selection efficiencies, deployment strategies, and the possibility of creating crop trees with novel characteristics. This article discusses four main areas of concern that influence the future of tree improvement: economics, societal expectations, rate of scientific advancement, and organizational infrastructure. Key to the economic concerns are the restraints that arise from the fact that wood and fiber products are temporarily abundant in the global market. Under these conditions, tree improvement is restrained to adding value either by lowering production costs or by making qualitative changes capable of transforming the output into higher value specialty products. Key to the societal expectations is how tree improvement practitioners address the limits set by society on acceptable technology. We have a responsibility to shape public and corporate policies by helping evaluate the risks and benefits of alternative technologies. We have more control of the advancement of science and its silvicultural application. Nevertheless, advances in science occur at irregular intervals and are impossible to predict. The one area of our future that we collectively control is the infrastructure by which we organize our efforts. Criteria for successful infrastructure will be those that support continuity of effort, maximize return from limited resources, and foster cooperative research while simultaneously promoting the development of proprietary intellectual property.

During the earliest Maastrichtian, oxygen and neodymium isotope data suggest a significant contribution of relatively warm intermediate water from the North Pacific. Isotopic shifts through the early Maastrichtian suggest that this warmer water mass was gradually replaced by cooler waters originating in the Southern Ocean. Although the cooler water mass remained dominant through the remainder of the Maastrichtian, it was displaced intermittently at shallow intermediate depths by North Pacific intermediate water. The globally recognized “mid‐Maastrichtian event” ∼69 Ma, manifested by the brief appearance of abundant inoceramid bivalves over shallow portions of Shatsky Rise, is characterized by an abrupt increase (∼2°–3°C) in sea surface temperatures, a greater flux of organic matter out of the surface ocean, and warmer (∼4°C) intermediate waters.

Measured noise characteristics as well as extracted oxide trap density values are discussed for various geometries and sizes. The latter, measured to be 1.5×1019–1.6×1020cm−3eV−1, is higher than that for SiO2 MOSFETs with similar dimensions (4.1×1016–7.8×1016cm−3eV−1). This work represents an investigation of interface generated flicker noise on HfSiON gate stacks.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.1866507/13211230/082102_1_online.pdf",""

The rise is attributed to interface roughening and to constraints placed on the electron mean-free paths by the nanocrystals.

To determine whether immortalized cells derived from the rat SCN (SCN2.2) retain these intrinsic rhythm-generating properties, oscillatory behavior of the SCN2.2 transcriptome was analyzed and compared with that found in the rat SCN in vivo using rat U34A Affymetrix GeneChips. In SCN2.2 cells, 116 unique genes and 46 ESTs or genes of unknown function exhibited circadian fluctuations with a 1.5-fold or greater difference in their mRNA abundance for two cycles. Many (35%) of these rhythmically regulated genes in SCN2.2 cells also exhibited circadian profiles of mRNA expression in the rat SCN in vivo. Functional analyses and cartography indicate that a diverse set of cellular pathways are strategically regulated by the circadian clock in SCN2.2 cells and that the largest categories of rhythmic genes are those involved in cellular and systems-level communication or in metabolic processes like cellular respiration, fatty acid recycling, and steroid synthesis. Because many of the same genes or nodes within these functional categories were rhythmically expressed in both SCN2.2 cells and the rat SCN, the circadian regulation of these pathways may be important in modulating input to or output from the SCN clock mechanism. In summary, global expression and circadian regulation of the SCN2.2 transcriptome retain many SCN-like properties, suggesting that genes displaying rhythmic profiles in both experimental models may be integral to their function as both circadian oscillators and pacemakers.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/physiolgenomics.00224.2004",""

We have previously reported the linkage of type 2 diabetes and age at diabetes onset to an overlapping region on chromosome 10q in the San Antonio Family Diabetes Study (SAFADS). In this study, we investigated menangioma-expressed antigen-5 (MGEA5) as a positional candidate gene. Twenty-four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), identified by sequencing 44 SAFADS subjects, were genotyped in 436 individuals from 27 families whose data were used in the original linkage report. Association tests indicated significant association of a novel SNP with the traits diabetes (P = 0.0128, relative risk = 2.77) and age at diabetes onset (P = 0.0017). The associated SNP is located in intron 10, which contains an alternate stop codon and may lead to decreased expression of the 130-kDa isoform, the isoform predicted to contain the O-GlcNAcase activity. We investigated whether this variant was responsible for the original linkage signal. The variance attributed to this SNP accounted for ∼25% of the logarithm of odds. These results suggest that this variant within the MGEA5 gene may increase diabetes risk in Mexican Americans.","https://journals.org/diabetes/diabetes/article-pdf/54/4/1214/658002/zdb00405001214.pdf",""

The result should facilitate MEMS development in university laboratories with a microelectronics focus, and encourage the transfer of MEMS production to aging or underutilized industrial facilities. Aluminum structures, with silicon dioxide or silicon nitride dielectric layers, are built upon a silicon or glass wafer substrate. Shipley SC1827 photoresist provides a 2.7 μm thick sacrificial layer. The release etch is the critical fabrication step. This must be a dry process to avoid stiction, should be isotropic to minimize the etch time, and should be capable of large undercut distances to minimize the need for etch holes. Finally, the etch must be sufficiently selective to allow for the necessary release etch time without significantly impacting non-sacrificial structures. An O2/CHF3 plasma etch has been developed to meet these requirements. Using this process we have designed, fabricated and tested structures with moveable mirrors suspended over multiple drive and sense electrodes.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2005-82704/2636393/183_1.pdf",""

The class of devices under study consists of a movable, rigid, grounded electrode, with a variety of allowable rotational and/or translational degrees of freedom, and a set of multiple, fixed, independently-addressable, drive electrodes. Previous work has placed the general electrostatic forces and the electrical system in a framework suitable for passivity-based control. This paper generalizes this result further by allowing the electrical part of the model to incorporate current leakage between electrodes. With respect to this model a stabilizing dynamic feedback control laws is derived in terms of coordinate-independent geometric formulas. To obtain controllers for a specific device it is then necessary only to evaluate these formulas. Appropriate approximations may be applied to make the computations more tractable. Performance may be improved using dynamic output feedback, but additional information is needed, typically in the form of a model relating electrode capacitances to the system configuration. We demonstrate the controller computations on a representative MEMS, and validate performance using ANSYS simulations.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2005-80458/2634210/1307_1.pdf",""

We focused on three questions: Does a driver's response to a lead car's deceleration occur when the car's optical size, expansion rate, or tau reaches a “critical” value? Does effective information differ for near and far lead cars? Is a driver's response affected by discrete warnings (brake lights and auditory warnings) that occur independently of optical flow information? Results suggested that responses were not based on a critical value of the optical parameters considered here, and were affected by discrete warnings. Further, effective information varied with the distance and deceleration rate of the lead car. Results were consistent with prior proposals that advanced brake warning systems and collision-avoidance warning systems can reduce the incidence of rear-end collisions.

Each surface station measures up to 15 meteorological and 10 agricultural parameters over an observation period of 5 and 15 min, respectively. The mesonet uses a combination of radio, cell phone, landline phone, and serial server (Internet) communication systems to relay data back to the base station at Reese Technology Center (formerly Reese Air Force Base), Texas. Data are transmitted through the radio network every 5 min for most meteorological data and every 15 min for agricultural data. For stations located outside of the radio network, phone systems transmit data every 30–60 min. The archive includes data received through the various communication systems, as well as data downloaded in the field from each station during regularly scheduled maintenance visits. Quality assurance/control (QA/QC) tests effectively flag data for manual review from a decision maker. The QA/QC flags and review decisions are then added to the database.

Variations in MTHFR functions likely play roles in the etiology of lung cancer. The MTHFR gene has three nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (i.e., C677T, A1298C, and G1793A) that have a minor allele frequency of &gt;5%. We investigated the associations between the frequencies of MTHFR variant genotypes and risk of lung cancer in a hospital-based case-control study of 1,051 lung cancer patients and 1,141 cancer-free controls in a non-Hispanic White population. We found that compared with the MTHFR 1298AA genotype, the 1298CC genotype was associated with a significantly increased risk of lung cancer in women [(odds ratio (OR), 2.09; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.32-3.29)] but not in men (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.62-1.45). The MTHFR 677TT genotype was associated with a significantly decreased risk of lung cancer in women (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.40-0.92) but not in men. No association was found between the MTHFR G1793A polymorphism and risk of lung cancer. Further analysis suggested evidence of gene-dietary interactions between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and dietary intake of vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and methionine in women and evidence of gene-environment interactions between the MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms and tobacco smoking in men. In conclusion, the polymorphisms of MTHFR may contribute to the risk of lung cancer in non-Hispanic Whites and modify the risk associated with the dietary and environmental exposure in a sex-specific manner.","https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article-pdf/14/6/1477/1744854/1477-1484.pdf",""

The tube works as a diaphragm, which transfers the pumping motion from the silicon electrothermal actuators to fluid. In order to guide the design of the pump, FEM simulation was performed for structural analysis on Parylene tube and evaluation of the electrothermal actuator. Parylene was conformally deposited on the nickel coated DRIE processed silicon mold, and peeled off and two Parylene layers were bonded together to form a tube.

Our previous studies showed that IL-12 inhibited tumor growth in human osteosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma animal model. Decreased Fas expression in osteosarcoma increased the lung metastatic potential. In this study, we further examined the mechanism of IL-12 antitumor activity and showed that IL-12 significantly increased Fas expression in both human osteosarcoma cells LM7 and Ewing's sarcoma cells TC71. Up-regulation of Fas expression increased their sensitivity to Fas-induced cell apoptosis. Constructs of the Fas promoter linked to a luciferase reporter gene were used to determine the promoter activity. IL-12 increased Fas promoter activity 4.2- and 4.9-fold in TC71 and LM7 cells, respectively. Time course studies have shown that recombinant IL-12 stimulated Fas promoter activity at 2 hours, reached the peak level at 4 hours, and then declined at 24 hours. To investigate whether IL-12 specifically enhanced Fas promoter activity, we determined whether another gene (E1A) was able to stimulate Fas promoter activity. We also evaluated effect of IL-12 on the topoisomerase IIα promoter. The results indicated that E1A but not IL-12 stimulated topoisomerase IIα promoter activity. E1A failed to increase Fas promoter activity. We also found that κB-Sp1 element at position −295 to −286 in Fas promoter was essential for IL-12-induced activation, and nuclear factor-κB transcription factor was activated after IL-12 treatment in TC71 cells. These results indicate that IL-12 up-regulates Fas expression in human osteosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma by enhancing Fas promoter activity. Understanding this mechanism may lead to new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of sarcoma involving the use of IL-12.

Despite the evidence linking mGluR to learning mechanisms, their role in mossy fiber-CA3 long-term potentiation (LTP) is not yet clear. To explain the involvement of mGluR-I in memory mechanisms, we examined the function of the mGluR-I antagonist 1-aminoindan-1, 5-dicarboxylic acid (AIDA) on the induction of mossy fiber-CA3 LTP in vivo in male Sprague Dawley and Fischer 344 (F344) rats. Acute extracellular mossy fiber (MF) responses were evoked by stimulation of the MF bundle and recorded in the stratum lucidum of CA3. The excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) magnitude was measured by using the initial slope of the field EPSP slope measured 2–3 ms after response onset. After collection of baseline MF-CA3 responses at 0.05 Hz, animals received either ((±))-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid ( N-methyl-d-aspartate-R antagonist, 10 mg/kg ip), naloxone (opioid-R antagonist, 10 mg/kg ip), or AIDA (mGluR antagonist, 1 mg/kg ip or 37.5 nmol ic).

Over tropical land masses the rainfall peaks in the afternoon and evening hours. The relative amplitude of the diurnal harmonic over land is larger than over the ocean, often exceeding 50% of the mean rain rate.

We therefore investigated the effect of targeted ablation of two folate transport genes, folate binding protein 1 (Folbp1) and reduced folate carrier 1 (RFC1), on folate homeostasis to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of folate action on colonocyte cell proliferation, gene expression, and colon carcinogenesis. Targeted deletion of Folbp1 (Folbp1+/− and Folbp1−/−) significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.05) colonic Folbp1 mRNA, colonic mucosa, and plasma folate concentration. In contrast, subtle changes in folate homeostasis resulted from targeted deletion of RFC1 (RFC1+/−). These animals had reduced (P &lt; 0.05) colonic RFC1 mRNA and exhibited a 2-fold reduction in the plasma S-adenosylmethionine/S-adenosylhomocysteine. Folbp1+/− and Folbp1−/− mice had larger crypts expressed as greater (P &lt; 0.05) numbers of cells per crypt column relative to Folbp1+/+ mice. Colonic cell proliferation was increased in RFC1+/− mice relative to RFC1+/+ mice. Microarray analysis of colonic mucosa showed distinct changes in gene expression specific to Folbp1 or RFC1 ablation. The effect of folate transporter gene ablation on colon carcinogenesis was evaluated 8 and 38 weeks post-azoxymethane injection in wild-type and heterozygous mice. Relative to RFC1+/+ mice, RFC1+/− mice developed increased (P &lt; 0.05) numbers of aberrant crypt foci at 8 weeks. At 38 weeks, RFC1+/− mice developed local inflammatory lesions with or without epithelial dysplasia as well as adenocarcinomas, which were larger relative to RFC1+/+ mice. In contrast, Folbp1+/− mice developed 4-fold (P &lt; 0.05) more lesions relative to Folbp1+/+ mice. In conclusion, Folbp1 and RFC1 genetically modified mice exhibit distinct changes in colonocyte phenotype and therefore have utility as models to examine the role of folate homeostasis in colon cancer development.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/65/3/887/2539058/887-897.pdf",""

Our previous studies showed that IL-12 inhibited tumor growth in human osteosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma animal model. Decreased Fas expression in osteosarcoma increased the lung metastatic potential. In this study, we further examined the mechanism of IL-12 antitumor activity and showed that IL-12 significantly increased Fas expression in both human osteosarcoma cells LM7 and Ewing's sarcoma cells TC71. Up-regulation of Fas expression increased their sensitivity to Fas-induced cell apoptosis. Constructs of the Fas promoter linked to a luciferase reporter gene were used to determine the promoter activity. IL-12 increased Fas promoter activity 4.2- and 4.9-fold in TC71 and LM7 cells, respectively. Time course studies have shown that recombinant IL-12 stimulated Fas promoter activity at 2 hours, reached the peak level at 4 hours, and then declined at 24 hours. To investigate whether IL-12 specifically enhanced Fas promoter activity, we determined whether another gene (E1A) was able to stimulate Fas promoter activity. We also evaluated effect of IL-12 on the topoisomerase IIα promoter. The results indicated that E1A but not IL-12 stimulated topoisomerase IIα promoter activity. E1A failed to increase Fas promoter activity. We also found that κB-Sp1 element at position −295 to −286 in Fas promoter was essential for IL-12-induced activation, and nuclear factor-κB transcription factor was activated after IL-12 treatment in TC71 cells. These results indicate that IL-12 up-regulates Fas expression in human osteosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma by enhancing Fas promoter activity. Understanding this mechanism may lead to new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of sarcoma involving the use of IL-12.

Hispanic female farmworkers (N = 716) who were 50 years of age and older living in communities in Texas, New Mexico, and California were interviewed at their homes. Data collection was conducted from November 2001 to February 2002. Logistic regression models showed no significant effect for acculturation for the entire sample. Post hoc stratified analysis found that bicultural study participants in California were 3 times more likely to be adherent to screening compared to those with low acculturation. Study findings suggest that distinct differences might exist for Hispanic women living in farmworker communities in California, and perhaps other communities not on the United States-Mexico border.

Despite the evidence linking mGluR to learning mechanisms, their role in mossy fiber-CA3 long-term potentiation (LTP) is not yet clear. To explain the involvement of mGluR-I in memory mechanisms, we examined the function of the mGluR-I antagonist 1-aminoindan-1, 5-dicarboxylic acid (AIDA) on the induction of mossy fiber-CA3 LTP in vivo in male Sprague Dawley and Fischer 344 (F344) rats. Acute extracellular mossy fiber (MF) responses were evoked by stimulation of the MF bundle and recorded in the stratum lucidum of CA3. The excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) magnitude was measured by using the initial slope of the field EPSP slope measured 2–3 ms after response onset. After collection of baseline MF-CA3 responses at 0.05 Hz, animals received either ((±))-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid ( N-methyl-d-aspartate-R antagonist, 10 mg/kg ip), naloxone (opioid-R antagonist, 10 mg/kg ip), or AIDA (mGluR antagonist, 1 mg/kg ip or 37.5 nmol ic). LTP was induced by two 100-Hz trains at the intensity sufficient to evoke 50% of the maximal response. Responses were collected for an additional 1 h.

Several chromosomes have been labeled as “players” in the development of prostate cancer, among them chromosome 1 and X chromosome have been reported to harbor prostate cancer susceptibility loci. However, there is little information regarding the background levels of chromosome instability in these patients. In this pilot study, we examined spontaneous chromosome instability in short-term lymphocyte cultures from 126 study subjects, 61 prostate cancer patients, and 65 healthy controls. We evaluated chromosomal instability using a fluorescence in situ hybridization assay using two probes targeting specific regions on X chromosome and chromosome 1. Our results showed a significantly higher mean level of spontaneous breaks involving the X chromosome in patients compared with controls (mean ± SE, 2.41 ± 0.26 and 0.62 ± 0.08, respectively; P &lt; 0.001). Similarly, chromosome 1 spontaneous breaks were significantly higher among cases compared with controls (mean ± SE, 1.95 ± 0.24 and 1.09 ± 0.16, respectively; P &lt; 0.001). Using the median number of breaks in the controls as the cutoff value, we observed an odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 15.53 (5.74 - 42.03; P &lt; 0.001) for spontaneous X chromosome breaks and 3.71 (1.60 - 8.63; P &lt; 0.001) for chromosome 1 breaks and risk of development of prostate cancer. In conclusion, our preliminary results show that spontaneous chromosome instability could be a risk factor for prostate cancer.","https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article-pdf/14/3/748/2262840/748-752.pdf",""

More than 900 of them (29%) show a significant change between any of the five time points analyzed, and these have been annotated based on their sequence similarity with the Arabidopsis proteome.

Multi-BAC probe cocktails were constructed for each chromosome from the landed BACs, which were also preevaluated for FISH signal quality, relative position, and collective chromosome coverage. Comparison to the corresponding linkage map revealed full concordance of locus order between cytological and prior segregation analyses. The pericentromeric heterochromatin constituted a large quasi-uniform block in each bivalent and was especially large in the bivalent corresponding to LG-08. Centromere positions in LG-02 and LG-08 were progressively delimited using FISH to identify landed BACs for which the FISH signals visibly flanked the centromere. Alignment of linkage and cytological maps revealed that pericentromeric heterochromatin of these sorghum chromosomes is largely devoid of recombination, which is mostly relegated to the more distal regions, which are largely euchromatic. This suggests that the sorghum genome is thus even more amenable to physical mapping of genes and positional cloning than the C-value alone might suggest. As a prelude to positional cloning of the fertility restorer, Rf1, FISH of BAC clones flanking the Rf1 locus was used to delimit the chromosomal position of the gene. FISH of BACs that contain the most proximal linkage markers enabled localization of Rf1 to a ∼0.4-Mbp euchromatic region of LG-08. Cytogenetic analyses of Rf1 and other trait loci will aid in assessing the feasibility of positional cloning and help formulate strategies required for cloning this and other agriculturally critical genes.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/169/2/955/42216190/genetics0955.pdf",""

The imposed organization appeared to be coded in a relatively abstract way, as evidenced by effector transfer that was as good as that on the retention test. In Experiment 2 the 16-element sequence was studied after more extensive practice. By the end of 4 days of practice the participants produced relatively seamless responses void of obvious transitions between subsequences, but the control of the movement was less effector independent than observed earlier in practice.

Implant oxide was etched to varying degrees on different samples resulting in screen oxide thickness from 0 to 50Å. On samples where the screen oxide was completely etched away, cap oxide was deposited with thickness varying from 0 to 50Å. The implanted wafers were then spike annealed at 1050°C. We found that the thicker the oxide during annealing, the deeper the B diffusion profile. A model of the Si–SiO2 system based on the interactions of B dopant atoms and silicon interstitials with SiO2 films is proposed to explain the experimental observations. The model takes into account the segregation of Si interstitials at the Si∕SiO2 interface and the diffusion of that Si in the oxide.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.1884246/10655531/073520_1_online.pdf",""

Yet, relatively little is known about the distribution of the fitness effects of beneficial mutations in populations. Recent work of Gillespie and Orr suggested some of the first generalizations for the distributions of beneficial fitness effects and, surprisingly, they depend only weakly on biological details. In particular, the theory suggests that beneficial mutations obey an exponential distribution of fitness effects, with the same exponential parameter across different regions of genotype space, provided only that few possible beneficial mutations are available to that genotype. Here we tested this hypothesis with a quasi-empirical model of RNA evolution in which fitness is based on the secondary structures of molecules and their thermodynamic stabilities. The fitnesses of randomly selected genotypes appeared to follow a Gumbel-type distribution and thus conform to a basic assumption of adaptation theory. However, the observed distributions of beneficial fitness effects conflict with specific predictions of the theory. In particular, the distributions of beneficial fitness effects appeared exponential only when the vast majority of small-effect beneficial mutations were ignored. Additionally, the distribution of beneficial fitness effects varied with the fitness of the parent genotype. We believe that correlation of the fitness values among similar genotypes is likely the cause of the departure from the predictions of recent adaptation theory. Although in conflict with the current theory, these results suggest that more complex statistical generalizations about beneficial mutations may be possible.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/170/4/1449/42062059/genetics1449.pdf",""

An assessment and risk-ranking methodology is proposed that incorporates moment–shear interaction. From analyses of vehicle loads on indeterminate bridge models, maximum moment and maximum shear are not coincident at intermediate support locations. Determining the critical combination of shear and moment requires evaluation of envelope values from shear–moment load histories for comparison with capacity curves. Capacity of the sections is determined by using AASHTO modified compression field theory, and statistical understrength is based on experimental test results. Comparison of the load effects and capacity is demonstrated for an in-service bridge to determine the reliability index (measure of relative risk) at sections along a girder. The reliability index can be used to establish rational load restrictions on the basis of a target reliability index for the inventory. The index can also be used for comparison between components and populations of conventionally reinforced concrete bridges for risk ranking. Ranking based on relative reliability indexes permits bridge engineers and managers to prioritize the bridges for repair or replacement.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0361198105192800112",""

Regarding the interaction potential, the model assumes the presence of an activated state, intermediate between physisorption and chemisorption, and includes second-order recombination-desorption processes important in the modeling of high-temperature growth. It is shown that the formation energy of epitaxial GaN, Ef, depends on the growth conditions as the activation energy and surface diffusion energy barriers increase or decrease with the change in the impinging fluxes and surface density of precursors.

Using density functional theory calculations within the generalized gradient approximation, we have examined the structure, stability and diffusion of As–Sii pairs. For the negatively charged As–Sii pair, we find a minimum energy structure in which the As atom bridges two approximate lattice Si atoms, while for the neutral and positively charged As–Sii we find the lowest energy structure is comprised of an As and Sii pair that is aligned in the [110] direction while sharing a lattice site. Our results suggest that in n-type extrinsic regions the diffusion of −1 charged As–Sii pairs will be prevailing with an overall activation energy of 3.1–3.4eV, while under intrinsic conditions the neutral and −1 charged pairs will both contribute to arsenic diffusion. The predicted activation energies are similar to experimental observations for As diffusion and previous calculations for As-vacancy complex diffusion. These results clearly support that interstitials can contribute significantly to As transient enhanced diffusion, particularly in the region where interstitials exist in excess.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.2130398/14650788/231905_1_online.pdf",""

Recently, vinorelbine and cisplatin combination chemotherapy has been shown for the first time to confer a significant survival advantage in early-stage lung cancer after surgical therapy. The biological mechanisms underlying the differential response of NSCLC to cytocidal activity of vinorelbine have yet to be elucidated. Our recent findings indicate a role of RLIP76, a non–ATP binding cassette transport protein, in catalyzing the ATP-dependent efflux of structurally and functionally unrelated chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin and vinblastine in NSCLC. Present studies were conducted to assess whether RLIP76 mediates vinorelbine transport and resistance. Here we show that RLIP76 catalyzes the transport of vinorelbine in a saturable manner with respect to vinorelbine (Km 75 nmol/L) and ATP (Km = 3.4 mmol/L). Three-fold overexpression of RLIP76 in NSCLC and SCLC confers increased resistance to cytotoxicity. RLIP76 overexpression causes a sustained intracellular decrease in vinorelbine concentration because of increased efflux, and anti-RLIP76 antibodies sensitize lung cancer cells to vinorelbine by inhibiting its efflux. These studies for the first time show that RLIP76 mediates vinorelbine transport and is capable of conferring drug accumulation defect and resistance to lung cancer cells.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/65/3/991/2538775/991-998.pdf",""

We posit that the oxygen that remained after the low-temperature anneals was chemisorbed on the Si surface at defects in the Se passivation layer. The Se passivation layer was stable up to an annealing temperature of ∼800°C before desorbing from the surface.

Benefiting from the large energy density of mica capacitors, four mica capacitors were utilized in parallel per stage, keeping the parasitic inductance per stage low. Including the spark-gap switches, a stage inductance of 55 nH was measured, which translates with 100 nF capacitance per stage to ∼18.5Ω characteristic Marx impedance. Using solely inductors, ∼1mH each, as charging elements instead of resistors enabled charging the Marx within less than 100 ms with little charging losses. The pulse width of the Marx into a matched resistive load is about 200 ns with 50 ns rise time. Repetitive HPM generation with the Marx directly driving a small virtual cathode oscilator (Vircator) has been verified. The Marx is fitted into a tube with 30 cm diameter and a total length of 0.7 m.

The self-bias dc voltage, densities of gaseous species, fluorocarbon film thickness on Si substrate, as well as etch rates of SiO2 and Si were measured during plasma processing as functions of the pressure, CF4 gas flow rate, rf source power, platen bias power, and source-platen gap. The gaseous molecules and radicals monitored included CF4, CF3, CF2, SiF4, and COF2, among which CF4 and SiF4 were found to be the two dominant species, combining for about 80% of the total concentration. The density ratio of SiF4 and COF2 was about 2:1 with no bias on the substrate and increased up to ∼8:1 when Si substrate etching took place. Specifically, as the Si etch rate increased, the COF2 density dropped, likely due to suppressed etching of the quartz source window, while the density of SiF4 increased. Comparisons between the gas phase data and etch rate results of Si and SiO2 indicate that the gas phase chemistry is strongly influenced by surface reactions on the substrate, wall, and quartz source window.

About 58 per cent of patients in the United States and 49 per cent in México rated the products as “excellent” in treating their conditions. Ninety-two percent of U.S, and 93 per cent of Mexican patients did not inform their physician of their herbal use. Preoperative assessment of patients did not include inquiries about herbal products in either hospital. With the growing use of herbal products and because most users do not inform their physician, there is increasing concern related to the possible occurrence of herbal-related adverse events during and after surgery. The fact that health care personnel did not inquire about herbal product use before surgery is an added concern.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/000313480507100114",""

Dramatically different expression levels of DOC-2/DAB2 mRNA and protein are observed among several human transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) cell lines, suggesting that transcriptional regulation may play a role in these cells. In this study, we have shown that the histone acetylation status associated with the 5′ upstream regulatory sequence of DOC-2/DAB2 gene is one of the key determinants for its gene expression. In addition, GATA6 but not other GATA family members, such as GATA2 and GATA4, can specifically induce DOC-2/DAB2 promoter activity, although GATA transcription factors share a very similar DNA-binding sequence. We also show that increased histone acetylation and the presence of GATA6 have a synergistic effect on DOC-2/DAB2 promoter activity, which results in the elevation of DOC-2/DAB2 protein expression. Thus, we conclude that transcriptional regulation of DOC-2/DAB2 gene in human TCC is determined by histone acetylation and a specific transcription factor (i.e., GATA6), which underlie the reduced DOC-2/DAB2 protein expression in TCC cells.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/65/14/6089/2532421/6089-6096.pdf",""

Additional testing is in progress. A pump with large plunger/barrel clearance will cause high fluid slippage. A pump with smaller clearance will cause less fluid slippage, but a tighter fit will tend to increase rod buckling at the pump to a greater degree and may lead to advanced pump and rod wear rates. Therefore, it is important to be able to predict pump slippage and also related forces at the downhole pump. Considerations for pump leakage and example calculations are presented using the older and the new pump slippage relationships. A derivation to account for the pump velocity effects on slippage is also presented. The effect of pump clearances on possible rod buckling above the pump is also studied. Further additional possible causes of rod buckling are presented, discussed, and compared. The results will help the reader to decide on sizing pump clearances to provide leakage for pump lubrication without losing too much on pump efficiency. Several ideas on the sources of rod buckling, such as flow through the travelling valve, and the plunger-barrel interaction are presented and compared. A review of methods to combat rod buckling above the pump is presented.","http://onepetro.org/JCPT/article-pdf/doi/10.2118/05-05-05/2174920/petsoc-05-05-05.pdf",""

Despite the inherent continuum assumption in our models, reasonably close qualitative and quantitative agreement with existing atomistic simulations is obtained. The latter lends credence to the belief that continuum formulations, with correct incorporation of the relevant physics, can be a powerful and yet simple tool for exploring nanoscale phenomena in carbon nanotubes.

Avicins induce apoptosis in Jurkat T leukemia cells by targeting mitochondria and release of cytochrome c that occurs in a p53-independent manner. However, postmitochondrial antiapoptotic barriers, such as increased expression of heat shock proteins (Hsp) and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (XIAP), frequently exist in cancer cells and often account for resistance to chemotherapy and a poor prognosis. In this article, we show the role of avicins in the activation of stress-regulated ubiquitination and degradation of Hsp70 and XIAP. This is the first report showing the regulation of Hsp70 via the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. We also show the induction of E3α ubiquitin ligase in avicin-treated Jurkat T leukemia cells, and its involvement in the degradation of XIAP. Avicin-mediated suppression of Hsp70 and XIAP was further confirmed in other leukemic/lymphoma cell lines and freshly isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes from Sezary syndrome patients. No change in the Hsp70 and XIAP proteins was observed in peripheral blood lymphocytes from normal donors. We propose that the ability of avicins to induce ubiquitination and regulate the degradation of Hsp70 and XIAP in leukemia cells could have important implications in the treatment of drug-resistant neoplasia and inflammatory disorders.","https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article-pdf/11/5/1953/1961972/1953-1962.pdf",""

Bioactive prostaglandins produced by prostaglandin synthases and secreted by the prostate into seminal plasma are thought to support reproduction, but their endogenous effects on cancer formation remain unresolved. No studies to date have examined prostaglandin enzyme production or prostaglandin metabolism in normal prostate stromal cells. Our results show that lipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase (L-PGDS) and prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) metabolites produced by normal prostate stromal cells inhibited tumor cell growth through a peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ (PPARγ)–dependent mechanism. Enzymatic products of stromal cell L-PGDS included high levels of PGD2 and 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGD2 but low levels of 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2. These PGD2 metabolites activated the PPARγ ligand-binding domain and the peroxisome proliferator response element reporter systems. Thus, growth suppression of PPARγ-expressing tumor cells by PGD2 metabolites in the prostate microenvironment is likely to be an endogenous mechanism involved in tumor suppression that potentially contributes to the indolence and long latency period of this disease.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/65/14/6189/2535018/6189-6198.pdf",""

Various approaches can facilitate interdisciplinary interactions, but we submit that there is a critical need for a new educational paradigm for the way that we train biomedical engineers, life scientists, and mathematicians. We cannot continue to train graduate students in isolation within single disciplines, nor can we ask any one individual to learn all the essentials of biology, engineering, and mathematics. We must transform how students are trained and incorporate how real-world research and development are done–in diverse, interdisciplinary teams. Our fundamental vision is to create an innovative paradigm for graduate research and training that yields a new generation of biomedical engineers, life scientists, and mathematicians that is more diverse and that embraces and actively pursues a truly interdisciplinary, team-based approach to research based on a known benefit and mutual respect. In this paper, we describe our attempt to accomplish this via focused training in biomechanics, biomedical optics, mathematics, mechanobiology, and physiology. The overall approach is applicable, however, to most areas of biomedical research.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/advan.00053.2004",""

In the U.S., stem cells found in the umbilical cord are routinely placed into bio-hazardous waste after birth. Here, stem cells derived from human umbilical cord Wharton's Jelly, called umbilical cord matrix stem (UCMS) cells, are characterized. UCMS cells have several properties that make them of interest as a source of cells for therapeutic use. For example, they 1) can be isolated in large numbers, 2) are negative for CD34 and CD45, 3) grow robustly and can be frozen/thawed, 4) can be clonally expanded, and 5) can easily be engineered to express exogenous proteins. UCMS cells have genetic and surface markers of mesenchymal stem cells (positive for CD10, CD13, CD29, CD44, and CD90 and negative for CD14, CD33, CD56, CD31, CD34, CD45, and HLA-DR) and appear to be stable in terms of their surface marker expression in early passage (passages 4–8). Unlike traditional mesenchymal stem cells derived from adult bone marrow stromal cells, small populations of UCMS cells express endoglin (SH2, CD105) and CD49e at passage 8. UCMS cells express growth factors and angiogenic factors, suggesting that they may be used to treat neurodegenerative disease. To test the therapeutic value of UCMS cells, undifferentiated human UCMS cells were transplanted into the brains of hemiparkinsonian rats that were not immune-suppressed. UCMS cells ameliorated apomorphine-induced rotations in the pilot test. UCMS cells transplanted into normal rats did not produce brain tumors, rotational behavior, or a frank host immune rejection response. In summary, the umbilical cord matrix appears to be a rich, noncontroversial, and inexhaustible source of primitive mesenchymal stem cells.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1634/stemcells.2005-0330",""

Trehalulose contents ranged from 0.002% to 0.034% of the fiber weight (corresponding to 1.8% and 16.8% of the total sugars), while melezitose contents ranged from 0.023% to 0.071% (corresponding to 10.5% and 22.5% of the total sugars). High-speed stickiness detector (H2SD) readings of the card slivers ranged from 2.0 to15.7. At these relatively low levels of contamination there was no correlation between ends-down in spinning and H2SD readings. Results showed that in the short term, less than 12 H2SD spots within a mix of cotton does not seem to influence spinning productivity on either ring (Saco-Lowell SF-3H) or rotor (Rieter R20) systems. A slight, but significant, negative effect on the ring-spun yarn quality was found even at low levels of stickiness. In the long term, it appears likely that even very small amounts of trehalulose slowly contaminate the equipment.

Echoes from a general interface consist of both specularly reflected and diffusely scattered contributions. Specular reflection results from smooth uniform interfaces, whereas diffuse scattering results from rough nonuniform interfaces and inhomogeneous media. This article discusses how these phenomena are important to the acquisition and analysis of coherent radar sounding data. Reflection results are presented from airborne surveys conducted in 1987 over the downstream portions of Whillans Ice Stream and Ice Stream C, West Antarctica. Additionally, reflection and scattering analyses along with new results are presented for repeat profiles flown in 2001 over Ice Stream C. Analysis methods include using echo amplitudes to compute reflection coefficients which are used for inferring the dielectric properties of the subglacial material. Echo phase analysis provides the locations of dominant scattering centers which relate to reflection or scattering from the interface as well as provide interface roughness estimates. Comparison of low‐ and high‐resolution imaging obtained from synthetic aperture radar techniques indicates a reflecting and/or scattering interface. Combining the results from these independent analyses provides classification of the subglacial environment. Classified regions include smooth seawater, smooth saturated sediments, accreted marine ice, rough bottom crevasses, mixed conditions with partial subglacial water, and dry frozen conditions.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2004JB003222",""

Class II MHC and Ii expression was believed to be restricted to classical antigen-presenting cells (APC); however, during inflammation, other cell types, including mucosal epithelial cells, have also been reported to express class II MHC molecules. Given the importance of Ii in the biology of class II MHC, we sought to examine the expression of Ii by gastric epithelial cells (GEC) to determine whether class II MHC molecules in these nonconventional APC cells were under the control of Ii and to further support the role that these cells may play in local immune and inflammatory responses during Helicobacter pylori infection. Thus we examined the expression of Ii on GEC from human biopsy samples and then confirmed this observation using independent methods on several GEC lines. The mRNA for Ii was detected by RT-PCR, and the various protein isoforms were also detected. Interestingly, these cells have a high level expression of surface Ii, which is polarized to the apical surface.

Therefore, controversy exists over the proper extent of thyroidectomy and regional lymph node dissection in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) and medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). The modest disease-specific mortality makes it unlikely that the extent of surgery will ever be the subject of a prospective randomized trial. Although more extensive cervical surgery may have only a limited effect on the duration of survival in patients with DTC, it may significantly improve quality of life by minimizing cervical recurrence. The high rates of cervical recurrence in patients with DTC and MTC have alerted physicians to the importance of fine-needle aspiration biopsy and ultrasonography for the diagnosis, preoperative staging, and follow-up of thyroid cancer. In patients with MTC, death caused by disease is uncommon in the absence of radiographically evident distant metastasis at the time of thyroidectomy. Cervical recurrence is even more common with MTC, and the need for compartment-oriented lymphadenectomy is accepted as standard surgical treatment to minimize disease recurrence. Postoperatively, calcitonin (CT) levels can be used to guide clinical management, but basal CT levels should not be used to direct the timing of prophylactic thyroidectomy in affected high-risk patients with familial MTC.","https://jnccn.org/view/journals/jnccn/3/3/article-p458.xml",""

Cysteine-rich 61 (CCN1) is a matricellular protein of which expression is up-regulated in cancer and various vascular diseases. The present study was undertaken to investigate whether plasmin liberates CCN1 from the ECM and whether the released growth factor modulates endothelial cell migration. Treatment of breast carcinoma cells (MDA-MB-231) with plasmin released a truncated form of CCN1 (28 kDa) into the overlying medium. Experiments with recombinant CCN1 confirmed that plasmin effectively cleaves CCN1. Thrombin and other clotting/fibrinolytic proteases are ineffective in cleaving CCN1. Further studies revealed that the conditioned medium of plasmin-treated carcinoma cells supports endothelial cell migration and that antibodies specific to CCN1 blocked this enhancing effect. These data were the first to show that plasmin can liberate a pluripotent matrix signaling protein, CCN1, from the ECM. Because both CCN1 and the components of the plasmin generation system are present in tumor cells and a variety of other cells, the proteolysis of CCN1 by plasmin may play a role in many pathophysiologic processes, including tumor cell–mediated angiogenesis.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/65/21/9705/2865750/9705-9711.pdf",""

This paper focuses on frequent item sets, the identification of which forms a critical initial step in a variety of data-mining tasks. It presents an optimal approach for hiding sensitive item sets, while keeping the number of modified transactions to a minimum. The approach is particularly attractive as it easily handles databases with millions of transactions.

In particular, we have recently found that GRP and its cell surface receptor, GRP‐R, are abundantly expressed in neuroblastomas. Moreover, more advanced‐stage neuroblastomas demonstrated an increased level of GRP‐R, suggesting an important role of GRP in aggressive tumor behavior. This review describes the role of several GI hormones commonly expressed in neuroblastoma and discusses in depth the mitogenic actions of GRP in neuroblastoma. In addition, the molecular mechanisms involved in the GRP‐induced stimulation of neuroblastoma cell growth are discussed. Our study results demonstrate a role of GRP as an autocrine/paracrine growth factor and elucidate involvement of specific intracellular signaling, the phosphatidylinositol 3‐kinase pathway, in the growth regulation of neuroblastoma.","http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00268-004-7815-4.pdf",""

During August, sampling was conducted at a rural site on the Texas A&M campus in College Station, and in September, sampling was conducted at an urban site near the Houston ship channel. Measurements from both sites indicate that there are cyclical changes in the composition of the soluble fraction of the aerosol, which are not strongly linked to the local aerosol source. The observations show that as temperature increases and RH decreases, the hysteresis loop describing the RH dependence of aerosol hygroscopic growth collapses. On the basis of results from other studies that have shown the dominant ions present in aerosols in this region to be ammonium and sulfate, it is proposed that this collapse is due to a decrease in the ammonium to sulfate ratio in the aerosol particles, which coincides with increasing temperature and decreasing RH. This cyclical change in aerosol acidity may influence secondary organic aerosol production and may exaggerate the impact of the aerosol on human health. The compositional changes also result in a daily cycle in crystallization RH that is in phase with that of the ambient RH, which reduces the probability that hygroscopic particles will crystallize in the afternoon when the ambient RH is a minimum.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2004JD005279",""

Analytical expressions to estimate the static displacement of solid spheres and gas bubbles are presented. Under a continuously applied static force, both the solid sphere and the initially spherical gas bubble are displaced, and the bubble is deformed. The transient responses of the inclusions are described using motion equations. The displacements of the inclusion in elastic incompressible lossless media are analyzed using both frequency-domain and time-domain formalism, and the equations of motion are derived for both a solid sphere and a gas bubble.

Threshold voltage instability at 1nm equivalent oxide thickness is less than 10mV after a 1000s stress at 22MVcm. ΔVTH monotonically increases with HfSiON physical thickness.

The tube is instrumented with strain gauges in hoop and in axial directions and can be used in open or closed configurations. By making measurements of the isotropic stresses as a function of temperature, the method allows determination of the thermal pressure coefficient in both the glassy and rubbery (or liquid) states. The method also can be used to measure isotropic stress development in thermosetting resins during cure and subsequent thermal cycling. Experimental results are presented for sucrose benzoate, di-2-ethylhexylsebacate, and an epoxy resin. The current report shows that the method provides reliable estimates for the thermal pressure coefficient. The thermal pressure coefficient is determined with resolution on the order of 10kPa∕K.

Therefore, we examined the effects of first MTP joint arthrodesis on activities of daily living and recreational activities. Methods: Fifty-three patients (60 feet) who had isolated arthrodesis of the first (MTP) joint using a parallel screw fixation technique were evaluated for the functional outcome after the surgery to determine the effect of the arthrodesis on the activities of daily living and on recreational sports and exercise. Results: Fusion was achieved in all patients; all but three stated that they would have the surgery again. Postoperative pain scores evaluated using the Visual Analogue Scale indicated effective pain relief. High levels of function were demonstrated in this group of patients. Conclusion: Arthrodesis of the first MTP joint is not only a successful surgical technique for relief of pain and correction of deformity but also allows a high level of function in everyday life and in recreational activities.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/107110070502600205",""

This work is motivated by high-intensity laser-cluster interaction experiments. The theory reveals that the breakdown of quasineutrality affects the cluster dynamics in a dramatic way: the laser can create a positively charged ion shell that expands due to its own space charge much faster than the central part of the cluster. The developed theory also shows a trend for the electron population to have a two-component distribution function: a cold core that responds to the laser field coherently and a hot halo that undergoes stochastic heating. The hot electrons expand together with the equal number of ions that are accelerated to supersonic velocities in a double layer at the cluster edge. This mechanism produces fast ions with energies much greater than the ponderomotive potential and it suggests that larger deuterium clusters can significantly enhance the neutron yield in future experiments.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pop/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.1871939/13508691/056706_1_online.pdf",""

Here, we present a simple fluorescence spectroscopy system to detect the presence of this contrast agent in biological models representative of living tissues in order to demonstrate the feasibility of using a spectroscopy system in conjunction with a contrast agent as a screening technique for oral cancer. The spectroscopy system was tested for the ability to detect the contrast agent in four in vitro models: multilayer tissue phantoms made of cells pre-labeled with the contrast agent, multilayer tissue phantoms labeled with the contrast agent from the surface in conjunction with a permeability-enhancing agent, fresh tissue slices from normal and abnormal oral cavity biopsies, and whole normal and abnormal oral cavity biopsies. The optical signal from samples labeled with the contrast agent was 3–32 times stronger compared to controls and was detected with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 10. These results demonstrate that an inexpensive and simple spectroscopy system can be used in biological models of living systems to detect the optical signal from a contrast agent targeted toward a cancer-related biomarker with good signal-to-noise ratios. Coupling inexpensive fluorescence spectrometers with molecular-specific contrast agents has the potential to improve the early detection of oral neoplasia by providing a low-cost screening tool.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1366/0003702055012582",""

A full understanding of how SARS-CoV would interact with lung epithelial cells will be vital for advancing our knowledge of SARS pathogenesis. However, an in vitro model of SARS-CoV infection using relevant lung epithelial cells is not yet available, making it difficult to dissect the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV in the lungs. Here, we report that SARS-CoV can productively infect human bronchial epithelial Calu-3 cells, causing cytopathic effects, a process reflective of its natural course of infection in the lungs. Indirect immunofluorescence studies revealed a preferential expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), the functional receptor of SARS-CoV, on the apical surface. Importantly, both ACE-2 and viral antigen appeared to preferentially colocalize at the apical domain of infected cells. In highly polarized Calu-3 cells grown on the membrane inserts, we found that cells exposed to virus through the apical rather than the basolateral surface showed high levels of viral replication. Progeny virus was released into the apical chamber at titers up to 5 logs higher than those recovered from the basolateral chambers of polarized cultures. Taken together, these results indicate that SARS-CoV almost exclusively entered and was released from the apical domain of polarized Calu-3 cells, which might provide important insight into the mechanism of transmission and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.79.15.9470-9479.2005",""

These mice were instrumented previously for long-term telemetric blood pressure recording. Control groups were sham-operated and given tap water. Mean arterial pressures were determined, and 3 weeks after initiation of each protocol, tissues were taken for histopathologic studies. The deoxycorticosteroid-salt protocol produced a significant 35% mean arterial pressure increase in both mouse strains. No pathological changes were observed in sections of aortas and femoral arteries from any of the groups studied. Likewise, heart and kidney sections from the hypertensive wild-type mice showed no pathological changes compared with their normotensive counterparts. In contrast, marked vasculitis was seen in the heart sections from the deoxycorticosteroid-salt–treated α-calcitonin gene-related peptide knockout mice with thickening and inflammation of the vessel walls. In addition, myocarditis and focal epicarditis with areas of myocardial necrosis were present. Kidneys of these mice exhibited prominent glomerular changes including congestion of the capillary loops, focal mesangial and crescent proliferation, and focal histocytic infiltration.

These data suggest that deletion of the α-calcitonin gene-related peptide gene makes the heart and kidneys more vulnerable to hypertension-induced end organ damage.","https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/01.HYP.0000151130.34874.fa",""

Such is the case with compliant features embedded in amputee prosthetic sockets to relieve contact pressure at the residual limb-socket interface. The purpose of this study was to present a framework for designing compliant features to be incorporated into transtibial sockets and manufacturing prototypes using selective laser sintering (SLS) and Duraform™ material. The design process included identifying optimal compliant features using topology optimization algorithms and integrating these features within the geometry of the socket model. Using this process, a compliant feature consisting of spiral beams and a supporting external structure was identified. To assess its effectiveness in reducing residual limb-socket interface pressure, a case study was conducted using SLS manufactured prototypes to quantify the difference in interface pressure while a patient walked at his self-selected pace with one noncompliant and two different compliant sockets. The pressure measurements were performed using thin pressure transducers located at the distal tibia and fibula head. The measurements revealed that the socket with the greatest compliance reduced the average and peak pressure by 22% and 45% at the anterior side distal tibia, respectively, and 19% and 23% at the lateral side of the fibula head, respectively. These results indicate that the integration of compliant features within the socket structure is an effective way to reduce potentially harmful contact pressure and increase patient comfort.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/biomechanical/article-pdf/127/6/946/5676501/946_1.pdf",""

The radar and electromagnetic induction responses lend themselves to plan‐view imaging of the subsurface, while the magnetics data reveal the presence of buried magnetic bodies in a more subtle fashion. Several intriguing geophysical signatures were discovered, including what may be the buried remains of a railway turntable, ordnance fragments in the bomb craters, a buried steel‐reinforced concrete trench, and a linear chain of machine‐gun firing positions.

The reliability of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) following chemotherapy has not been determined. This was a meta-analysis of studies that examined the results of SLNB after preoperative chemotherapy. Methods: Included articles had to meet two criteria. First, patients had to have had operable breast cancer and to have undergone SLNB after preoperative chemotherapy and, second, patients had to have undergone subsequent axillary lymph node dissection. Meta-analyses were performed in which Bayesian hierarchical models were created to estimate the identification rate (IR) and sensitivity of SLNB in this setting. Results: Twenty-one studies were identified that included a total of 1273 patients. The IRs reported ranged from 72 to 100 per cent, with a pooled estimate of 90 per cent. The sensitivity of SLNB ranged from 67 to 100 per cent, with a pooled estimate of 88 (95 per cent confidence interval 85 to 90) per cent. Meta-analyses performed using Bayesian modelling resulted in (posterior) estimates for IR and sensitivity of 91 (95 per cent credible interval 88 to 94) and 88 (95 per cent credible interval 84 to 91) per cent respectively.

Numerical solutions are obtained for the coupled diffusion problems and analytical solutions are obtained for several limiting cases. The effects of surface diffusivity and interface diffusivity on stress relaxation of polycrystalline thin films are analyzed and compared with experiments. The model predicts a transient behavior of stress relaxation and provides a quantitative correlation between stress relaxation and the kinetics of mass transport. In particular, the models can be used together with isothermal stress relaxation tests to characterize interface diffusion and to evaluate selected cap layers for improving electromigration reliability of Cu interconnects.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.1904721/14848982/103532_1_online.pdf",""

It presents a simple mathematical argument for ionospheric density observations obeying a lognormal distribution. To demonstrate the efficacy of the lognormal distribution, a sample distribution of total ion densities is presented and is compared with a lognormal distribution characterized by parameters estimated from the data. This distribution of DMSP observations fits a lognormal distribution with a probability plot correlation coefficient (PPCC) of 0.99932.

Gust factors are heavily dependent on upstream terrain conditions (roughness), but are also affected by transitional flow regimes (specifically, changes in terrain and the distance from the upstream terrain change to the measuring device), anemometer height, stability of the boundary layer, and, potentially, the presence of deep convection. Previous studies have yielded conflicting results regarding differences in gust factors that might exist between winds generated by tropical cyclones and those generated by extratropical systems. Using high-resolution wind speed data collected from both landfalling tropical cyclones and extratropical systems, two databases of wind characteristics were developed. Gust factors from tropical cyclone and extratropical winds were examined, summarized, and compared. Further analysis was conducted to examine and compare the characteristics of the associated tropical and extratropical wind speed histograms. As expected, the mean gust factor was found to increase with increasing upstream surface roughness. Some differences were observed between data from the tropical environment and the extratropical environment. Mean gust factors from the tropical regime were found to be higher than mean gust factors from the extratropical environment within each roughness regime and the wind speed histograms generated from data from the two environments indicated some differences.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jamc/article-pdf/44/2/270/3294528/jam2199_1.pdf",""

The apparatus allows the testing of specimens along a wide range of stress paths and stress levels that are not achievable in a conventional uniaxial or cylindrical apparatus. A multi-stage testing scheme can be followed by simultaneous control of the major, intermediate, and minor principal stresses directly applied to the specimens. Two cubical AC specimens cut from two WestTrack block samples were subjected to a series of multi-stage stress paths that included triaxial compression (TC), triaxial extension (TE), simple shear (SS), conventional triaxial compression (CTC), conventional triaxial extension (CTE), and cyclic conventional triaxial extension (CCTE). Experimental data were analyzed to assess volumetric creeping properties, resilient response, plastic deformation response, Poisson's ratio, loss angle, and dilatancy of asphalt concrete under general stress states. Test results highlight the potential of the cubical cell for mechanical characterization of asphalt concrete in a broad range of applications involving true triaxial stress states. Analysis of test results indicates all of the following: (a) Modulus of AC shows significant anisotropy in different orientations; (b) Volumetric creeping of AC is considerably significant at relatively high pressures; (c) AC shows significant dilatancy; and (d) Cubical Device can distinguish mixes of different performance.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/journalastminternational/article-pdf/2/10/1/7087556/10_1520_jai12276.pdf",""

From an existing bond graph of a squirrel cage induction motor, state equations were extracted and simulations performed. Simulated were various cases, including the response of an ideal motor, which functions perfectly to designer’s specifications, and motors with shorted stator coils, a bad phase capacitor, and broken rotor bars. By constructing an analogy between the motor and a communication channel, Shannon’s theorems of information theory were applied to assess functional health. The principal health metric is the channel capacity, which is based on integrals of signal-to-noise ratios. The channel capacity monotonically reduces with degradation of the system, and appears to be an effective discriminator of motor health and sickness. The method was tested via simulations of a three-phase motor; and for experimental verification, a two-phase induction motor was modeled and tested. The method was able to predict impending functional failure, significantly in advance.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/dynamicsystems/article-pdf/128/3/584/5692280/584_1.pdf",""

The interfacial oxide (IFO) at the monosilicon–polycrystalline silicon interface is found to significantly affect the noise behavior. The low-frequency noise originates from two independent fluctuation mechanisms: in the diffusion and tunneling components of the base current noise power spectral density (SIB) and from the diffusion current and carrier number fluctuations in the collector current noise power spectral density (SIC). The Hooge noise parameters for electrons and holes are calculated from the diffusion fluctuation models for SIB and SIC, respectively. Noise measurements on devices with different sizes and different IFO thicknesses indicate that the fluctuations occur in the minority-carrier (electron) tunneling current component of SIB through the IFO. The thickness of the IFO is estimated using this noise model. The tunneling fluctuations dominate over the diffusion fluctuations for the smaller (0.7×0.7μm2) transistors, while the opposite is the case for the larger (0.7×100μm2) ones. The scaling effect on the noise performance of these transistors is discussed. The effect of the IFO on the dc characteristics and the noise behavior of the PNP transistors is compared to that of the negative-positive-negative (NPN) counterparts on the same wafer.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.1868058/16722725/084501_1_online.pdf",""

In the United States, it has been speculated, but not shown, that Africanized honeybees would hybridize extensively with European honeybees. Here we report a continuous 11-year study investigating temporal changes in the genetic structure of a feral population from the southern United States undergoing Africanization. Our microsatellite data showed that (1) the process of Africanization involved both maternal and paternal bidirectional gene flow between European and Africanized honeybees and (2) the panmitic European population was replaced by panmitic mixtures of A. m. scutellata and European genes within 5 years after Africanization. The post-Africanization gene pool (1998–2001) was composed of a diverse array of recombinant classes with a substantial European genetic contribution (mean 25–37%).

To this end, we screened a chemical library for new anticancer agents and identified a synthetic compound, 5-(2,4-dihydroxybenzylidene)-2-(phenylimino)-1,3-thiazolidin (DBPT), which kills cancer cells more effectively than it kills normal human fibroblasts. The molecular mechanism of the antitumor action of DBPT was further analyzed in three human colorectal cancer cell lines. DBPT effectively inhibited the growth of colorectal cancer cells, independent of p53 and P-glycoprotein status, whereas normal fibroblasts were unaffected at the same IC50. Over time, DLD-1 cancer cells treated with DBPT underwent apoptosis. The general caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-valine-alanine-aspartate-fluoromethylketone partially blocked DBPT-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. DBPT-induced apoptosis, including cytochrome c release and caspase activation, was abrogated when c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) activation was blocked with either a specific JNK inhibitor or a dominant-negative JNK1 gene. However, constitutive JNK activation alone did not replicate the effects of DBPT in DLD-1 cells, and excessive JNK activation by adenovirus encoding MKK7 had little influence on DBPT-induced apoptosis. Our results suggested that DBPT induces apoptosis in colorectal cancer cell lines through caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways and that JNK activation was crucial for DBPT-induced apoptosis. DBPT and its analogues might be useful as anticancer agents.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/65/14/6380/2531860/6380-6387.pdf",""

The second method, termed input modification, modifies the input directly to account for distortion and uses the modified input in the existing (unmodified) knowledge base of the system. These methods are compared with an approach where input noise is ignored. Experimental results indicate that both types of modification substantially improve the accuracy of recommendations, with knowledge base modification outperforming input modification in most cases.

This was a meta-analysis of studies that examined the results of SLNB after preoperative chemotherapy. Methods: Included articles had to meet two criteria. First, patients had to have had operable breast cancer and to have undergone SLNB after preoperative chemotherapy and, second, patients had to have undergone subsequent axillary lymph node dissection. Meta-analyses were performed in which Bayesian hierarchical models were created to estimate the identification rate (IR) and sensitivity of SLNB in this setting. Results: Twenty-one studies were identified that included a total of 1273 patients. The IRs reported ranged from 72 to 100 per cent, with a pooled estimate of 90 per cent. The sensitivity of SLNB ranged from 67 to 100 per cent, with a pooled estimate of 88 (95 per cent confidence interval 85 to 90) per cent. Meta-analyses performed using Bayesian modelling resulted in (posterior) estimates for IR and sensitivity of 91 (95 per cent credible interval 88 to 94) and 88 (95 per cent credible interval 84 to 91) per cent respectively.

In this article, we show that surface expression of CD26, especially its intrinsic dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) enzyme activity, results in enhanced topoisomerase IIα level in the B-cell line Jiyoye and subsequent in vitro sensitivity to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. In addition, we show that expression of CD26/DPPIV is associated with increased phosphorylation of p38 and its upstream regulators mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3/6 and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 and that p38 signaling pathway plays a role in the regulation of topoisomerase IIα expression. Besides demonstrating that CD26 effect on topoisomerase IIα and doxorubicin sensitivity is applicable to cell lines of both B-cell and T-cell lineages, the potential clinical implication of our work lies with the fact that we now show for the first time that our in vitro results can be extended to a severe combined immunodeficient mouse model. Our findings that CD26 expression can be an in vivo marker of tumor sensitivity to doxorubicin treatment may lead to future treatment strategies targeting CD26/DPPIV for selected human cancers in the clinical setting.

We have evaluated the role of p38, a MAPK, in lymphoid cell apoptosis upon treatment with the synthetic GCs dexamethasone (Dex) or deacylcortivazol (DAC). The highly conserved phosphoprotein p38 MAPK is activated by specific phosphorylation of its threonine180 and tyrosine182 residues. We show that Dex and DAC stimulate p38 MAPK phosphorylation and increase the mRNA of MAPK kinase 3, a specific immediate upstream activator of p38 MAPK. Enzymatic assays confirmed elevated activity of p38 MAPK. Pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK activity was protective against GC-driven apoptosis in human and mouse lymphoid cells. In contrast, inhibition of the MAPKs, ERK and cJun N-terminal kinase, enhanced apoptosis. Activated p38 MAPK phosphorylates specific downstream targets. Because phosphorylation of the GR is affected by MAPKs, we examined its phosphorylation state in our system. We found serine 211 of the human GR to be a substrate for p38 MAPK both in vitro and intracellularly. Mutation of this site to alanine greatly diminished GR-driven gene transcription and apoptosis. Our results clearly demonstrate a role for p38 MAPK signaling in the pathway of GC-induced apoptosis of lymphoid cells.","http://academic.oup.com/mend/article-pdf/19/6/1569/10718701/mend1569.pdf",""

The apparatus allows the testing of specimens along a wide range of stress paths and stress levels that are not achievable in a conventional uniaxial or cylindrical apparatus. A multi-stage testing scheme can be followed by simultaneous control of the major, intermediate, and minor principal stresses directly applied to the specimens. Two cubical AC specimens cut from two WestTrack block samples were subjected to a series of multi-stage stress paths that included triaxial compression (TC), triaxial extension (TE), simple shear (SS), conventional triaxial compression (CTC), conventional triaxial extension (CTE), and cyclic conventional triaxial extension (CCTE). Experimental data were analyzed to assess volumetric creeping properties, resilient response, plastic deformation response, Poisson's ratio, loss angle, and dilatancy of asphalt concrete under general stress states. Test results highlight the potential of the cubical cell for mechanical characterization of asphalt concrete in a broad range of applications involving true triaxial stress states. Analysis of test results indicates all of the following: (a) Modulus of AC shows significant anisotropy in different orientations; (b) Volumetric creeping of AC is considerably significant at relatively high pressures; (c) AC shows significant dilatancy; and (d) Cubical Device can distinguish mixes of different performance.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/journalastminternational/article-pdf/2/10/1/7087556/10_1520_jai12276.pdf",""

CpG oligodeoxynucleotides induce cytokines, activate natural killer cells, and elicit T-cell responses leading to antitumor effects, including improved efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents and, as we reported recently, synergy between CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 1826 and single-dose radiotherapy of an immunogenic mouse fibrosarcoma. The present study extends this finding to the fractionated radiotherapy of the fibrosarcoma tumor and assesses the ability of CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 1826 to increase the radioresponse of a tumor (nonimmunogenic fibrosarcoma). The experiments used a murine immunogenic fibrosarcoma tumor, fibrosarcoma growing in the leg of mice, and response to radiotherapy was assessed by tumor growth delay and tumor cure rate (TCD50, radiation dose yielding 50% tumor cure). Multiple s.c. peritumoral or i.t. administrations of CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 1826 at a dose of 100 μg per mouse were given when established tumors were 6 mm in diameter. Local tumor irradiation was initiated when tumors grew to 8 mm in diameter; radiation was delivered in 1 to 9 Gy fractions given twice daily separated by 6 to 7 hours for 5 consecutive days to achieve a total dose of 10 to 90 Gy. CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 1826, given as a single agent, had only a small antitumor effect, but it dramatically enhanced fibrosarcoma response to radiotherapy. Although 83.1 (79.2-90.0) Gy total dose were needed to achieve tumor cures in 50% of mice treated with radiotherapy alone, only 23.0 (11.5-32.7) Gy total dose were needed in mice treated with both CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 1826 and radiotherapy. The magnitude of potentiation of tumor radioresponse at the TCD50 level was by a factor of 3.61, a much higher value than that (a factor of 1.93) that we reported for single-dose radiotherapy. Mice cured of their tumors by combined CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 1826 plus radiotherapy were highly resistant to s.c. tumor take or development of tumor nodules in the lung from i.v. injected tumor cells when rechallenged with fibrosarcoma cells 100 to 120 days after the treatment, suggesting the development of a memory response. CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 1826 also increased radioresponse of the nonimmunogenic fibrosarcoma tumor by a factor of 1.41 and 1.73 when CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 1826 was given s.c. and i.t., respectively. These findings show that CpG oligodeoxynucleotides are highly potent enhancers of tumor response to both single-dose and fractionated radiation and as such have potential to improve clinical radiotherapy.","https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article-pdf/11/1/361/1958233/361-369.pdf",""

Seismic velocities in this region generally increase linearly with depth, but simulations show that an isotropic vertical-gradient model cannot accurately reproduce traveltimes of first arrivals. However, a simple velocity-analysis inversion based on the wavefront-construction method allows a straightforward estimation of improved isotropic and transversely isotropic models that significantly reduce the misfit between computed traveltimes and the observations. The goal of this analysis is to produce a simple model suitable for use as a starting point for migrations and for assessing the importance of anisotropy in the field site. In fact, the final anisotropic model is much more consistent with background geologic information than the best isotropic model, which also has a larger rms traveltime error.

Simulated were various cases, including the response of an ideal motor, which functions perfectly to designer’s specifications, and motors with shorted stator coils, a bad phase capacitor, and broken rotor bars. By constructing an analogy between the motor and a communication channel, Shannon’s theorems of information theory were applied to assess functional health. The principal health metric is the channel capacity, which is based on integrals of signal-to-noise ratios. The channel capacity monotonically reduces with degradation of the system, and appears to be an effective discriminator of motor health and sickness. The method was tested via simulations of a three-phase motor; and for experimental verification, a two-phase induction motor was modeled and tested. The method was able to predict impending functional failure, significantly in advance.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/dynamicsystems/article-pdf/128/3/584/5692280/584_1.pdf",""

A reliability criterion of 1.5C∕cm2 shows that the methylating treatment decreases the defect density by a factor of 5. The energy density of the capacitor, just before failure, was calculated from the current values just before failure and the values are comparable with adhesion energies of known hard mask materials.

In this study, we developed and applied an assay using the luciferase (luc) reporter gene in a host-cell reactivation assay to measure DNA repair capacity for DNA damage induced by 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP), a well-studied aromatic amine and a known bladder carcinogen. We observed a dose-response relationship for 4-ABP dosage and DNA repair capacity (luc activity). We then applied this assay to measure DNA repair capacity in a pilot study of 89 pairs of bladder cancer patients and healthy controls matched by age, gender, and ethnicity, and we found that DNA repair capacity was significantly lower in cases than in controls (13.0% versus 14.4%; P = 0.006). Poor DNA repair capacity was associated with 3.42-fold increased bladder cancer risk. Further analysis revealed that intermediate and low levels of DNA repair capacity increased bladder cancer risk to 3.43-fold and 4.97-fold, respectively, compared with individuals with the most efficient DNA repair capacity. Moreover, ever smokers with suboptimal DNA repair capacity exhibited a 6.06-fold increased risk compared with never smokers with normal DNA repair capacity. In conclusion, our results support the hypothesis that deficient DNA repair capacity for 4-ABP induced DNA damage and increases bladder cancer risk. Our assay provides a new tool to specifically quantify DNA repair capacity in bladder cancer studies and, therefore, contributes to our goal of further elucidating bladder carcinogenesis.","https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article-pdf/14/7/1832/1748950/1832-1836.pdf",""

Sliding velocities of 0.05, 0.5, 5, and 50m∕s and loads of 0, 0.0625, 5, 15, 25, and 100 nN were considered. Nonequilibrium energy distributions were found at the interface for each of these conditions. The velocity distribution P(v) for the atoms in a sublayer of the smaller surface oscillates during the sliding, reflecting the periodicity of the interfacial intermolecular potential. When averaged over the sliding, this P(v) for each of the sublayers is bimodal with Boltzmann and non-Boltzmann components. The non-Boltzmann component, with temperatures in excess of 1000 K and as high as 2500 K, is most important for the interfacial H-atom sublayer and becomes less important in moving to a sublayer further from the interface. Similarly, the temperature of the Boltzmann component decreases for sublayers further from the interface and approaches the 300 K temperature of the boundary. The temperature of the Boltzmann component decreases, but the importance of the non-Boltzmann component increases, as the sliding velocity is decreased. The temperature of the non-Boltzmann component is relatively insensitive to the sliding velocity. Friction forces are determined by calculating the energy dissipation during the sliding, and different regimes are found for variation in the friction force versus sliding velocity vs and applied load. For vs of 0.05, 0.5, and 5m∕s, the friction force is inversely proportional to vs reflecting the increased time for energy dissipation as vs is decreased.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.1858856/15365540/094713_1_online.pdf",""

We find that Cl(P3∕22)+O(D21) is the dominant channel above the O(D21) threshold with minor contributions from the Cl(PJ2)+O(PJ3) and Cl(P1∕22)+O(D21) channels. We have measured the photofragment angular distributions for each dissociation channel and find that the AΠ2 state reached via a parallel transition carries most of the oscillator strength above the O(D21) threshold. The formation of O(PJ3) fragments with positive anisotropy is evidence of curve crossing from the AΠ2 state to one of several dissociative states. The curve crossing probability increases with wavelength in good agreement with previous theoretical calculations. We have directly determined the O(D21) threshold to be 38050±20cm−1 by measuring O(D21) quantum yield in the wavelength range of 260–270nm. We also report on the predissociation dynamics of ClO below the O(D21) threshold. We find that the branching ratio of Cl(P3∕22)∕Cl(P1∕22) is 1.5±0.1 at both 266 and 291nm. The rotational depolarization of the anisotropy parameters of the Cl(P3∕22) fragments provides predissociation lifetimes of 1.5±0.2ps for the 9-0 band and 1.0±0.4ps for the 8-0 band, in reasonable agreement with previous spectroscopic and theoretical studies.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.2083487/13577569/174303_1_online.pdf",""

Although anti-EGFR therapies are active in some patients, eventually disease in nearly all patients will become refractory to therapy. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms of resistance to anti-EGFR therapies is critical to further improve the efficacy of this class of agents. Mechanisms that mediate resistance to anti-EGFR therapies include the presence of redundant tyrosine kinase receptors, increased angiogenesis, and the constitutive activation of downstream mediators. Two recent landmark publications have also shown that specific mutations in the kinase domain of EGFR in some lung carcinomas are associated with markedly improved response rates to an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Mutations in the EGFR receptor seem to play a significant role in determining the sensitivity of tumor cells to EGFR inhibitor therapy by altering the conformation and activity of the receptor. As the field of molecular therapeutics continues to evolve, a comprehensive understanding of resistance mechanisms will ultimately lead to refinements in our regimens to provide better care for patients with cancer.","https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article-pdf/11/1/397/1957214/397-405.pdf",""

Because anticipation of declining prices makes consumers less willing to invest in owning the durable good, selling can be self-defeating for the manufacturer. If the manufacturer instead leases the product, it can eliminate its own incentive to decrease the price over time, which allows it to extract larger rents from consumers. In this paper, we investigate how a durable goods manufacturer’s choice between leasing and selling is affected by a complementary product that is produced by an independent firm. We show that a durable goods manufacturer that leases its product has an incentive to increase prices (by limiting the availability of the product) in response to the availability of a complement. Because this potential for opportunistic behavior discourages output of the complement, leasing can also be problematic. As a result, the durable goods manufacturer faces a trade-off between leasing, which commits the manufacturer to not overproduce, and selling, which commits it to not underproduce. Our contribution is to identify this trade-off and show how a durable goods manufacturer can use a combination of leasing and selling to balance its strategic commitment across both its own market as well as the complementary market.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0421",""

Additionally, Wind Engineering Mobile Instrumented Tower Experiment (WEMITE) data are exploited to provide a unique look into the surface structure of the captured rainbands. The observed meteorological data suggest equivalent potential temperature minima and decreasing hurricane-relative inflow to be commonly associated with intensifying or mature landfalling hurricane rainbands. Available vertical thermodynamic profiles suggest the source of the lower equivalent potential temperature air to range anywhere from 750 to 869 m above the surface, assuming no entrainment. Additionally, no discernable trend in wind speed is found to accompany the rainband’s passage.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/mwr/article-pdf/133/2/454/4214770/mwr-2866_1.pdf",""

In most cases, the SJAs used in demonstrations are either too large or too weak for realistic applications. In this work, we present the development of a new class of high-power synthetic jet actuators for realistic flow control applications. The operating principle of the actuator is the same as that of crankshaft driven piston engines, which makes a significant part of the technology necessary for the actuator development available off-the-shelf. The design of the actuator is modular and scalable. Several “building block” units can be stacked in series to create the actuator of the desired size. Moreover, active exit slot reconfiguration, in the form of variable exit slot width, decouples the actuator frequency from the actuator jet momentum coefficient and allows the user to set the two independently (within limits). Part I of this paper presents the design, fabrication and bench top characterization of the actuator. Several versions of the actuator were designed, built and tested, leading up to the development of a six-piston compact actuator that has a maximum power consumption of 1200 W (1.6 hp) and can produce (for the tested conditions) peak exit velocities as high as 124 m/s. In Part II, the actuator was housed in the interior of a NACA0015 profiled wing with a chord of 0.375 m (14.75 inches). The assembly’s performance in controlling flow separation was studied in the wind tunnel.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/fluidsengineering/article-pdf/127/2/367/5835086/367_1.pdf",""

It is demonstrated that 5nm Ru can function as a directly plateable Cu diffusion barrier up to at least 300°C vacuum anneal.

Electron energy loss spectroscopy analyses show no oxygen (O) across the Cu∕(5nmRu)∕Si interfaces, thereby indicating that the interlayer is ruthenium silicide (RuxSiy).

Studies show that hydrodynamic lubrication prevails through most of engine cycles, and asperity contact only occurs near the vicinity of dead centers [1][2]. In order to solve the governing equation of lubricant, appropriate velocity and pressure boundary conditions should be incorporated into the lubrication equation - Reynolds equation. While lubricant obeys the no-slip velocity boundary condition, the pressure boundaries at the leading and trail edge of piston ring are related to the chamber and the inter-ring crevice gas pressures. A complete lubrication analysis of piston ring requires an inter-ring gas flow model. In most of existing lubrication models, an isentropic orifice flow model is adopted and the gas flow is assumed to an ideal gas passing through the piston ring end gaps with a constant discharge coefficient [2][3][4][5]. In additional to the flow path of piston ring end gaps, gas also flows through the side-clearance between piston ring and flank groove [6][7][8][9][10]. In this paper, a quasi-Rayleigh narrow-channel gas flow model is proposed by consideration of temperature gradient along radial direction of piston assembly. Piston ring friction force is estimated by a test-rig verified mixed lubrication model [11]. Numerical simulation shows that piston ring friction force and ring axial motion are sensitive to inter-ring gas flow model. The instantaneous indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) method was adopted here to measure the piston friction during motoring condition. Experimental and numerical results indicate that top ring could contribute about 10% of total power cylinder friction loss.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/ICES/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/ICES2005-1086/2623938/469_1.pdf",""

Several approaches to account for this movement in the planning and delivery of treatment have been developed over the past several years. To assist in the development and assessment of various techniques for respiration‐correlated radiation therapy, a platform capable of programmable irregular longitudinal motion has been designed and fabricated to simulate intrafractional respiratory motion. A sliding platform and the base on which it was mounted were constructed from polycarbonate plastic, and a stepper motor provided platform motion. Respiratory motion data, either artificially generated on a spreadsheet or extracted from respiratory monitoring files, were converted to a format appropriate for driving the stepper motor. Various phantoms were placed on top of the platform and used in studies related to respiration‐correlated radiation therapy. Several applications of the platform were demonstrated, such as improving the quality of acquisition of time‐dependent computed tomography image datasets, comparing various methods of acquiring such datasets, and implementing feedback‐guided breath hold treatment delivery procedures. This study showed that a platform capable of programmable irregular motion is a useful tool for the development and assessment of procedures related to the effects of respiratory motion in radiation therapy.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1120%2Fjacmp.v6i1.2058",""

To elucidate the role of CD26 in tumor behavior, we examine the effect of CD26 depletion by small interfering RNA transfection of T-anaplastic large cell lymphoma Karpas 299. We show that the resultant CD26-depleted clones lose the ability to adhere to fibronectin and collagen I. Because anti–integrin β1 blocking antibodies also prevent binding of Karpas 299 to fibronectin and collagen I, we then evaluate the CD26-integrin β1 association. CD26 depletion does not decrease integrin β1 expression but leads to dephosphorylation of both integrin β1 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Moreover, our data showing that the p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 dephosphorylates integrin β1 and that binding of the anti-CD26 antibody 202.36 dephosphorylates both p38MAPK and integrin β1 on Karpas 299, leading to loss of cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix, indicate that CD26 mediates cell adhesion through p38MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of integrin β1.

In order of increasing zonal width and internal large‐scale substructuring, we study simple channels, multichannels, and superchannels. We find that peaks in channel activity are centered on 0° (African sector) and 180° (Western Pacific sector). Superchannels are found to strongly dominate in the African sector, whereas simple and multichannels dominate the Pacific sector. Within the African sector, the relative proportions of the three channel classes remain stable in all seasons. In the Pacific sector, simple and multichannels are dominant in all seasons of activity, though small but significant seasonal variations in channel widths and spacings are seen. Structure at a zonal scale size of about 100 km is found to be present in all channels examined. Observational and model evidence suggests that 100‐km density structure represents channels, such that all multichannels and superchannels consist of multiple contiguous simple channels. Since seeds that initiate channel formation necessarily influence large‐scale channel features, we utilize our data to draw conclusions regarding bottomside seeding conditions in the various seasonal and longitudinal sectors. Specifically, we find that strong, long‐wavelength (∼1000 km) seeds appear much more frequently in the African sector, resulting in the prevalence of superchannels there. When long‐wavelength seeds appear in the Pacific sector, they result in periodic trains of simple and multichannels. A bottomside preseeded at a scale size near 100 km accounts for the ubiquity of 100‐km scale size in the AE‐E data.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2005JA011153",""

Dysregulation of this process in cancer cells may lead to hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands, thus disabling transcription initiation of certain genes, such as tumor suppressor genes. Reversing epigenetic silencing and up-regulating genes involved in preventing or reversing the malignant phenotype has become a new, important targeted approach for cancer prevention and treatment. Therefore, methyltransferase inhibitors (MTI) have emerged recently as promising chemotherapeutic or preventive agents. The potent MTI 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-Azadc) causes growth arrest, differentiation, and/or apoptosis of many tumor types in vitro and in vivo. The present study shows that low micromolar concentrations of 5-Azadc induce the expression of 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15-LOX-1) in human colorectal cancer cells. The expression of 15-LOX-1 correlates with 5-Azadc-induced increases in 13-S-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid levels, growth inhibition, and apoptosis in these cells. Furthermore, specific inhibition of 15-LOX-1 by pharmacologic means or small interfering RNA significantly reduced the 5-Azadc-induced effects. These novel findings are the first demonstration of a mechanistic link between the induction of 15-LOX-1 by a MTI and apoptosis in cancer cells. This result has important implications for the study of 5-Azadc and other MTIs in the prevention and therapy of colorectal cancer and supports future investigations of the mechanisms by which MTIs up-regulate 15-LOX-1.","https://aacrjournals.org/mct/article-pdf/4/11/1740/1869211/1740.pdf",""

We showed previously that E1A gene transfer enhanced the sensitivity of Ewing's sarcoma cells to the topo IIα targeting agents etoposide and Adriamycin in vitro and in vivo. To determine whether this effect was specific for topo IIα, we investigated the effect of E1A gene transfer on cell sensitivity to agents that target topo I and IIβ. Transfecting TC71 human Ewing's sarcoma cells with an adenoviral vector containing the E1A gene enhanced their sensitivity to the topo IIα targeting agents etoposide (16-fold) and Adriamycin (8-fold). By contrast, E1A gene transfer did not affect cellular sensitivity to either amsacrine or camptothecin. Western blot analysis indicated that topo IIα protein levels increased 3.1-fold after E1A gene transfer, but topo I and IIβ protein levels did not change. A plasmid containing topo IIα gene promoter with luciferase reporter gene was constructed to determine the effects of E1A gene transfer on the activity of the topo IIα promoter. E1A increased the activity of the topo IIα gene promoter by 3.5-fold relative to that of cells transfected with Ad-β-gal. These results suggest that elevated topo IIα protein levels and enhanced sensitivity to topo IIα targeting agents were secondary to a direct effect of E1A on the topo IIα promoter. Combining E1A gene therapy with topo IIα targeting anticancer drugs may therefore have therapeutic benefit by increasing tumor cell sensitivity.","https://aacrjournals.org/mcr/article-pdf/3/5/271/3261922/287-296.pdf",""

A great deal of information has emerged in recent years about the possible role of PELP1 in estrogen receptor signaling. However, the participation and significance of PELP1 in other cellular signaling pathways remains unknown. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified PELP1 as a novel interacting protein of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) and found evidence of physiologic interaction between PELP1 and STAT3. We also found that these interactions played a mechanistic role in the positive regulation of STAT3 transcription from synthetic promoters and endogenous target genes such as cyclin D1, c-myc, and c-fos. Overexpression of PELP1 enhanced phosphorylation of STAT3 at Ser727 in a src-mitogen-activated protein kinase–sensitive manner and, conversely, down-regulation of PELP1 compromised growth factor–mediated induction of STAT3 target genes. We also discovered that PELP1 interacts with STAT3 in the nuclear compartment and down-regulation of PELP1 interfered with the recruitment of STAT3 to its target gene promoters. In summary, our results highlight a novel role for PELP1 in growth factor signaling and indicate that PELP1-mediated genomic and nongenomic functions play a role in the growth factor–mediated STAT3 transactivation functions. Such regulatory interactions of PELP1 may have important functional implications in the cross-talk of estrogen receptor and growth factor signaling.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/65/13/5571/2533473/5571-5577.pdf",""

Under the hypothesis that the plasma sheet electron population is the source of these electrons, which are convected to the outer radiation belt region during substorms, we estimate the flux of particles generated at geosynchronous orbit. We use the test particle method of following guiding center electrons as they drift in the electromagnetic fields during substorm dipolarization. The dipolarization pulse model electromagnetic fields are taken from the Li et al. (1998) substorm particle injection model. We find that a substorm dipolarization can produce enough electrons within geosynchronous orbit to account for the electrons seen following storms. To do this, we compute transport ratios of plasma sheet electrons, that is, the relative ratio of plasma sheet electrons that are transported and trapped in the inner magnetosphere during substorms, as well as the change in energy of the electrons. Since high fluxes of MeV electrons are only seen following storms and not isolated substorms, it is likely that these electrons may serve as a source population for other energization mechanisms which accelerate the electrons to MeV energies. Furthermore, we do parametric studies of the dipolarization model to understand physically what conditions enable the generation of this source population.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2004JA010511",""

The purpose of this study was to determine whether herceptin alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents could inhibit the growth of Ewing's sarcoma in vitro and in vivo. Western blot analysis showed that the protein levels of HER-2/neu were decreased following herceptin treatment. Cell growth was also inhibited by herceptin in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 4 mg/mL in TC71 and SK-ES1 cell line, whereas human immunoglobin had no effect. Northern blot and ELISA showed the RNA expression and protein levels of vascular endothelial growth factor were also inhibited by herceptin treatment with no alteration in HIF-1α protein and topoisomerase IIα expression. Furthermore, Ewing's sarcoma tumor growth was significantly delayed by 100 mg/kg herceptin treatment in our Ewing's sarcoma xenograft mouse model. Combining taxol with herceptin resulted in additive cytotoxicity, whereas herceptin-etoposide, doxorubicin, and 9-nitrocamptothecin combinations did not. Taxol-herceptin enhanced growth inhibition in TC71 cells in vitro compared with either agent alone. Ewing's sarcoma growth was also delayed in vivo and mean tumor size was significantly lower in mice treated with herceptin plus taxol than in those receiving taxol or herceptin alone. These data suggest that herceptin in combination with taxol may be a therapeutic option in the treatment of Ewing's sarcoma.","https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article-pdf/11/5/2008/1963399/2008-2017.pdf",""

Should the motorists stop or proceed through the intersection? Crashes that may occur at these intersections result in excessive property damage and personal injury because of the high speeds involved. The Texas Transportation Institute has developed a new system named the Advance Warning for End of Green System (AWEGS) for application at high-speed signalized intersections. Typically, dilemma zone detection strategy is based on a certain approach speed (typically the 85th percentile). AWEGS provides protection for the majority of motorists who are not covered by the dilemma zone treatment. AWEGS provides advance warning to motorists by using signs mounted on the roadside. These signs (Be Prepared To Stop When Flashing) would flash a beacon about 5 to 6 s before the onset of the yellow signal for high-speed approaches. Similar systems have been implemented in Canada and in a few U.S. states that use the trailing-green approach, which results in loss of dilemma zone protection every cycle. AWEGS, however, is almost completely independent of the traffic signal controller, and hence the signal controller would continue to provide the dilemma zone protection for which it was designed. The system was implemented at two sites in Waco and Brenham, Texas. Results of AWEGS implementation illustrated an improvement in traffic operations. AWEGS consistently enhanced the dilemma zone protection at intersections and reduced red light running by about 40%.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0361198105192500118",""

In this paper we develop an approach based on an inversion of density-functional theory (DFT), where we calculate the single-particle-surface potential from the experimentally measured equilibrium density profile in a nondilute colloidal fluid. The underlying DFT formulation is based on the recent work of Zhou and Ruckenstein [Zhou and Ruckenstein, J. Chem. Phys. 112, 8079 (2000)]. For model hard-sphere and Lennard-Jones systems, using Monte Carlo simulation to provide the “experimental” density profiles, we found that the inversion procedure reproduces the true particle-surface-potential energy to an accuracy within typical DCPM experimental limitations (∼0.1kT) at low to moderate colloidal densities. The choice of DFT closures also significantly affects the accuracy.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.1929734/15366798/224710_1_online.pdf",""

Nucleotide substitutions or deletions in the 3′ CCA of the tRNA-like sequence (TLS) affect minus-strand initiation unless repaired. We observed that 2-nucleotide deletions involving the CCA 3′ sequence in one or all BMV RNAs still allowed RNA accumulation in barley protoplasts at significant levels. Alterations of CCA to GGA in only BMV RNA3 also allowed RNA accumulation at wild-type levels. However, substitutions in all three BMV RNAs severely reduced RNA accumulation, demonstrating that substitutions have different repair requirements than do small deletions. Furthermore, wild-type BMV RNA1 was required for the repair and replication of RNAs with nucleotide substitutions. Results from sequencing of progeny viral RNA from mutant input RNAs demonstrated that RNA1 did not contribute its sequence to the mutant RNAs. Instead, the repaired ends were heterogeneous, with one-third having a restored CCA and others having sequences with the only commonality being the restoration of one cytidylate. The role of BMV RNA1 in increased repair was examined.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.79.3.1417-1427.2005",""

Longevity has a strong genetic component, as has become apparent from studies with a variety of organisms, from yeast to humans. Genetic screening efforts with invertebrates have unraveled multiple genetic pathways that suggest longevity is promoted through the manipulation of metabolism and the resistance to oxidative stress. To some extent, these same mechanisms appear to act in mammals also, despite considerable divergence during evolution. Thus far, evidence from population-based studies with humans suggests the importance of genes involved in cardiovascular disease as important determinants of longevity. The challenge is to test if the candidate longevity genes that have emerged from studies with model organisms exhibit genetic variation for life span in human populations. Future investigations are likely to involve large-scale case-control studies, in which large numbers of genes, corresponding to entire gene functional modules, will be assessed for all possible sequence variation and associated with detailed phenotypic information on each individual over extended periods of time. This should eventually unravel the genetic factors that contribute to each particular aging phenotype.","https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.med.56.082103.104617",""

Toxicological studies, while sparse, have been concerned with virtually uncharacterized, single wall carbon nanotubes, and the conclusions have been conflicting and uncertain. In this research we performed viability assays on a murine lung macrophage cell line to assess the comparative cytotoxicity of commercial, single wall carbon nanotubes (ropes) and two different multiwall carbon nanotube samples; utilizing chrysotile asbestos nanotubes and black carbon nanoaggregates as toxicity standards. These nanotube materials were completely characterized by transmission electron microscopy and observed to be aggregates ranging from 1 to 2 μm in mean diameter, with closed ends. The cytotoxicity data indicated a strong concentration relationship and toxicity for all the carbon nanotube materials relative to the asbestos nanotubes and black carbon. A commercial multiwall carbon nanotube aggregate exhibiting this significant cell response was observed to be identical in structure to multiwall carbon nanotube aggregates demonstrated to be ubiquitous in the environment, and especially in indoor environments, where natural gas or propane cooking stoves exist. Correspondingly, preliminary epidemiological data, although sparse, indicate a correlation between asthma incidence or classification, and exposure to gas stoves. These results suggest a number of novel epidemiological and etiological avenues for asthma triggers and related respiratory or other environmental health effects, especially since indoor number concentrations for multiwall carbon nanotube aggregates is at least 10 times the outdoor concentration, and virtually all gas combustion processes are variously effective sources.

The survival probability was found to be larger then that found previously for H2(v=1) scattered from the same surface; these differences are discussed in terms of the lower zero point energy and smaller vibrational energy spacings of D2. D2 translational energy exchange was studied for several different scattering channels and interpreted using simple classical calculations.

Six-minute hemodynamic data were continuously recorded in 11 elderly (70 ± 2 years) and 11 young (26 ± 1 year) healthy volunteers under supine resting condition and during lower body negative pressure–induced orthostatic challenge. The data were converted using fast Fourier transform, and the ratio of cross-spectra to auto-spectra between two signals (i.e., MAP-HR, CO-MAP, TPR-MAP) was computed for transfer function analysis. In the low-frequency ranges (LF; 0.04–O.14 Hz) and high-frequency ranges (0.15–0.30 Hz), the gain and coherence of the transfer function describing the relationship between MAP-HR signals were significantly greater in younger than in older adults. The phase degree was significantly >0 in both groups under all conditions, suggesting that the MAP variability preceded the HR variability. In contrast, the coherence between CO-MAP signals in both age groups was <0.5, indicating that the beat-to-beat MAP variability was not significantly related to the CO signals. However, the transfer function gain and coherence of TPR-MAP signals were significantly greater in the young group (coherence ≥0.5 in the LF range), suggesting a more effective dynamic vasomotor control. In conclusion, the oscillations in CO-MAP signals are not significantly synchronized or not related in a simply linear fashion in both age groups. The MAP variability is more related to the oscillation of TPR signals in the young group only. Advanced age not only diminishes MAP-HR transfer function gain, but also weakens its coherence. Thus, alterations in the relationship between MAP-HR variability and TPR-MAP variability may significantly contribute to the diminished dynamic control of cardiovascular function manifest in the elderly.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/153537020523000806",""

Further analysis shows that attributes of these chosen products are related to factors of the usage context (e.g. mass is related to transportation mode). These results demonstrate that valuable insight for product design is available through an understanding of usage context, and future work will refine and test methods to formally bring contextual information to bear on product design.

Obtaining detailed film cooling effectiveness distributions on the leading edge can be challenging. This paper considers two measurement techniques which can be applied to the leading edge (modeled by a cylinder) to obtain detailed distributions of the film effectiveness. A steady state pressure sensitive paint (PSP) technique and a transient infrared (IR) thermography technique are used to obtain detailed film cooling effectiveness distributions on the cylinder. The cylinder, 7.62 cm in diameter, is placed in a low speed wind tunnel, with the mainstream flow having a Reynolds number of 100,900 (based on the cylinder diameter). The cylinder has two rows of film cooling holes located at ±15° from the cylinder’s stagnation line. The pitch-to-diameter ratio of the film holes is 4, and holes are inclined 30° in spanwise direction. PSP continues to show promise for film cooling effectiveness measurements. Detailed distributions can be obtained near the film cooling holes because this technique relies on mass transfer rather than heat transfer. In order to reduce the error caused by conduction in heat transfer experiments, transient measurement techniques are favorable. Transient IR measurements are taken, and film cooling effectiveness is determined on the cylinder’s surface. Although the effect of conduction is reduced with the transient IR technique (compared to a steady state heat transfer experiment), heat conduction through the cylinder has not been eliminated (or even minimized). Without correction, the results obtained from transient heat transfer experiments must be used cautiously. For this reason, PSP is developing a niche within the gas turbine community for detailed film cooling effectiveness measurements.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2005-80146/4564144/467_1.pdf",""

In this paper, these ideas are applied to the Li−(H2) electrostatic complex, to compute all of the rovibrational bound state energies, and a number of resonance energies and widths, to very high accuracy (thousandths of a wave number). This application is very challenging, owing to the long-range nature of the interaction and to narrow level spacings near dissociation.

The difficulty of creating an unstable density stratification and repeatable fluid interface has made studying the Rayleigh-Taylor instability a challenging task. Our experiments utilize a water channel and most recently a gas channel (low speed wind tunnel). The experimental configuration allows unstable perturbations to develop into a mixing layer as they travel downstream. Thus resulting in a repeatable experiment and statistically steady flow. Various visualization techniques have been used to observe the development of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Visualizations using Nigrosene dye as a fluid marker are shown in the evolution of single and binary mode perturbations due to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. In contrast, visualizations of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability developed from multi-mode perturbations are seen for the gas channel using both fog and smoke to visualize the flow. Together these techniques help provide an understanding for the nature and complexity of buoyancy driven mixing.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2005-82736/4531065/119_1.pdf",""

This behavior presents a problem for two-phase space systems, such as environment conditioning, waste water processing, and power systems. Furthermore, with recent renewed interest in space nuclear power systems, a microgravity Rankine cycle is attractive for thermal to electric energy conversion and would require a phase separation device. Responding to this need, researchers have conceived various methods of producing phase separation in low gravity environments. These separator types have included wicking, elbow, hydrophobic/hydrophilic, vortex, rotary fan separators, and combinations thereof. Each class of separator achieved acceptable performance for particular applications and most performed in some capacity for the space program. However, increased integration of multiphase systems requires a separator design adaptable to a variety of system operating conditions. To this end, researchers at Texas A&M University (TAMU) have developed a Microgravity Vortex Separator (MVS) capable of handling both a wide range of inlet conditions as well as changes in these conditions with a single, passive design. Currently, rotary separators are recognized as the most versatile microgravity separation technology. However, compared with passive designs, rotary separators suffer from higher power consumption, more complicated mechanical design, and higher maintenance requirements than passive separators. Furthermore, research completed over the past decade has shown the MVS more resistant to inlet flow variations and versatile in application. Most investigations were conducted as part of system integration experiments including, among others, propellant transfer, waste water processing, and fuel cell systems. Testing involved determination of hydrodynamic conditions relating to vortex stability, inlet quality effects, accumulation volume potential, and dynamic volume monitoring. In most cases, a 1.2 liter separator was found to accommodate system flow conditions. This size produced reliable phase separation for liquid flow rates from 1.8 to 9.8 liters per minute, for gas flow rates of 0.5 to 180 standard liters per minute, over the full range of quality, and with fluid inventory changes up to 0.35 liters. Moreover, an acoustic sensor, integrated into the wall of the separation chamber, allows liquid film thickness monitoring with an accuracy of 0.1 inches. Currently, application of the MVS is being extended to cabin air dehumidification and a Rankine power cycle system. Both of these projects will allow further development of the TAMU separator.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2005-81616/4531247/763_1.pdf",""

Lack of DNA-PK causes defective DNA double-strand break repair and radiosensitization. In general, the cell death induced by IR is considered to be apoptotic. On the other hand, nonapoptotic cell death, autophagy, has recently attracted attention as a novel response of cancer cells to chemotherapy and IR. Autophagy is a protein degradation system characterized by a prominent formation of double-membrane vesicles in the cytoplasm. Little is known, however, regarding the relationship between DNA-PK and IR-induced autophagy. In the present study, we used human malignant glioma M059J and M059K cells to investigate the role of DNA-PK in IR-induced apoptotic and autophagic cell death. Low-dose IR induced massive autophagic cell death in M059J cells that lack the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK (DNA-PKcs). Most M059K cells, the counterpart of M059J cells in which DNA-PKcs are expressed at normal levels, survived, and proliferated although a small portion of the cells underwent apoptosis. Low-dose IR inhibited the phosphorylation of p70S6K, a molecule downstream of the mammalian target of rapamycin associated with autophagy in M059J cells but not in M059K cells. The treatment of M059K cells with antisense oligonucleotides against DNA-PKcs caused radiation-induced autophagy and radiosensitized the cells. Furthermore, antisense oligonucleotides against DNA-PKcs radiosensitized other malignant glioma cell lines with DNA-PK activity, U373-MG and T98G, by inducing autophagy. The specific inhibition of DNA-PKcs may be promising as a new therapy to radiosensitize malignant glioma cells by inducing autophagy.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/65/10/4368/2530668/4368-4375.pdf",""

The medical records of all patients undergoing vascular reconstruction for PAD during the previous 36 months were reviewed. Patient demographics, graft location and conduit, infection location, causative microorganisms, and factors potentially associated with development of infection were recorded. Infections were classified according to a modification of the CDC criteria into superficial incisional, deep incisional, or involving the graft (body only, anastomosis without disruption, or anastomosis with disruption). Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with the development of infection. Four hundred ten (84 aortic, 41 extraanatomic, and 285 infrainguinal) revascularization procedures were performed in 217 men and 193 women with a mean age of 62 years (range 43–88). The infection rate for the entire group was 11.0% (45/410). Eighty percent (36/45) occurred after infrainguinal reconstructions and 64% (29/45) of the infections involved the groin incision. Direct involvement of the graft occurred in 67% (30/45), and 27% (12/45) presented with anastomotic disruption. Of the infrainguinal infections, in situ and prosthetic reconstructions were associated with a significantly higher rate of infection than reversed vein grafts tunneled anatomically (p <0.001, chi-square analysis). Patients with nonautogenous grafts (24 expanded polytetrafluoroethylene and 2 bovine) presented with more advanced infections involving the graft (20/26 procedures) and were more likely to present with anastomotic disruption (11/26). Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in the majority of infections (64%) and in all cases involving graft disruption. Multivariate regression analysis identified the following factors associated with development of infection: previous hospitalization (p = 0.03), a younger age (p = 0.047), and the presence of a groin incision (p = 0.04). Twenty-five percent of graft infections resulted in major amputation, and 11% of patients with graft infection died as a result. The incidence, morbidity, and mortality of infections in vascular reconstructions for PAD are increasing dramatically, particularly in infrainguinal reconstructions involving groin incisions.

Not all cell lines secreted IL-6 in vitro; however, when the cell lines were implanted into the peritoneal cavity of female nude mice, every line secreted IL-6. Most human ovarian carcinoma cell lines tested secreted significant levels of the soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R). Endothelial cell lines established from the ovary and mesentery of female H-2Kb-tsA58 mice were tested for response to IL-6. Both endothelial cell lines expressed the IL-6R and their stimulation with the exogenous ligand significantly enhanced cell migration and activated the downstream signaling molecule signal transducers and activators of transcription 3. Dual immunohistochemical staining for IL-6R and CD31 revealed IL-6R expression on human endothelial cells within normal ovary and carcinoma specimens. Gelfoam sponges containing 0.4% agarose and IL-6 or basic fibroblast growth factor and implanted into the subcutis of BALB/c mice were vascularized to the same extent. Collectively, the data indicate that ovarian tumor cells secreted IL-6, a highly angiogenic cytokine that supports progression of disease.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/65/23/10794/2540833/10794-10800.pdf",""

Incorporation of CNDAC triphosphate into DNA and extension during replication leads to single-strand breaks directly caused by β-elimination. These breaks, or the lesions that arise from further processing, cause cells to arrest in G2. The purpose of this investigation was to define the molecular basis for G2 checkpoint activation and to delineate the sequelae of its abrogation. Cell lines derived from diverse human tissues underwent G2 arrest after CNDAC treatment, suggesting a common mechanism of response to the damage created. CNDAC-induced G2 arrest was instituted by activation of the Chk1-Cdc25C-Cdk1/cyclin B checkpoint pathway. Neither Chk2, p38, nor p53 was required for checkpoint activation. Inhibition of Chk1 kinase with 7-hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01) abrogated the checkpoint pathway as indicated by dephosphorylation of checkpoint proteins and progression of cells through mitosis and into G1. Cell death was first evident in hematologic cell lines after G1 entry. As indicated by histone H2AX phosphorylation, DNA damage initiated by CNDAC incorporation was transformed into double-strand breaks when ML-1 cells arrested in G2. Some breaks were manifested as chromosomal aberrations when the G2 checkpoint of CNDAC-arrested cells was abrogated by UCN-01 but also in a minor population of cells that escaped to mitosis during treatment with CNDAC alone. These findings provide a mechanistic rationale for the design of new strategies, combining CNDAC with inhibitors of cell cycle checkpoint regulation in the therapy of hematologic malignancies.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/65/15/6874/2532923/6874-6881.pdf",""

The assessment of platelet function using whole blood (WB) aggregation by an impedance method followed up nearly 20 years later. The WB impedance aggregation assay appears to be superior to the optical method because it 1) evaluates platelets in a physiologic milieu in the presence of red and white blood cells, which are known to modulate platelet function; 2) is faster; 3) has higher sensitivity; and 4) does not require centrifugation, thus avoiding injury to platelets and loss of giant thrombocytes. These two assays were compared. Clearly, the WB impedance aggregation methodology has many advantages over the optical PRP assay for the assessment of the hyperactive platelet syndrome and the effects of anti-platelet drugs.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/107602960501100103",""

By clamping composite specimens (M40J/PMR-II-50, [0,90]s, a uni-tape cross-ply) on the radial sides of half cylinders having two different radii (78.74mm and 37.96mm), three different in-plane strains including a no strain condition were applied to the composites. Three different thermal loading experiments, 1) 23°C to −196°C to 250°C, 2) 23°C to 250°C, and 3) 23°C to −196°C were performed as a function of mechanical in-plane strain levels. The apparatus was excellent enough to generate cracks related to the in-plane stresses (or strains) on plies. The quadratic failure criteria solution based on the thermal residual stresses shows a good agreement with the experimental results at low temperatures, but does not supply a good agreement at high temperatures. A weak adhesion of fiber/matrix interface at high temperatures (250°C) might cause the de-bonding at the interface and subsequent exposure to −196°C caused the intensive crack propagation.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2005-81262/2637472/243_1.pdf",""

Interactive surveys measuring customer product choice support the hypothesis that customer product preferences differ for each usage context identified. Further analysis shows that attributes of these chosen products are related to factors of the usage context (e.g. mass is related to transportation mode). These results demonstrate that valuable insight for product design is available through an understanding of usage context, and future work will refine and test methods to formally bring contextual information to bear on product design.

The present studies determined the role of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in hepatic GVHD. B6 responder cells were cultured with irradiated MHC class I disparate bm1 or syngeneic spleen cells (SpC) in the presence or absence of TNF receptor inhibitor [TNFR-immunoglobulin (Ig)]. Recipient bm1 × B6 F1 mice were irradiated (600 cGy) and reconstituted with 5 × 106 T cell-depleted B6 bone marrow cells and 1 × 107 B6 SpC. Mice were injected with an adenovirus encoding TNFR-Ig [TNF inhibitor-encoding adenovirus (Adv-TNFi)] or β-galactosidase (Adv-βgal). Severity of liver GVHD was assessed by a composite histopathological score consisting of the sum of scores for venulitis, lobular hepatitis, and bile duct inflammation. Addition of TNFR-Ig reduced cell proliferation in mixed lymphocyte cultures using B6 responder SpC by 71% ± 12.8% and interferon-γ responses by 78% ± 18%. GVHD-induced “wasting disease” was reduced in Adv-TNFi recipients [4.4%±5.2% weight loss (n=11)] compared with Adv-βgal recipients [16.1%±7.6% weight loss (n=11; P=0.0004)] 9 days post-transplant. Composite histopathological scores and individual venulitis scores were reduced with the addition of Adv-TNFi. Hepatic CD8+ T cells in the recipients of Adv-TNFi were reduced as compared with recipients of Adv-βgal. In conclusion, Adv-TNFi reduces MHC class I disparate alloproliferative responses and hepatic GVHD.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1189%2Fjlb.1204730",""

These compounds are remarkably effective in treating diverse cancers that are highly resistant to conventional treatment, including various forms of leukemia, hypereosinophilic syndrome, mast cell disease, sarcomas, and lung cancer.

The fidelity, mismatch extension ability, and lesion bypass efficiencies of these different polymerases are examined and evaluated in the context of their structures.One major conclusion is that, despite the overall similarity of basic structural features among the Y-family polymerases, there is a high degree of specificity in their lesion bypass properties. Some are able to bypass a particular DNA lesion, whereas others are efficient at only the insertion step or the extension step of lesion bypass. This functional divergence is related to the differences in their structures. Polζ is a highly specialized polymerase specifically adapted for extending primer termini opposite from a diverse array of DNA lesions, and depending upon the DNA lesion, it contributes to lesion bypass in a mutagenic or in an error-free manner. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) provides the central scaffold to which TLS polymerases bind for access to the replication ensemble stalled at a lesion site, and Rad6-Rad18-dependent protein ubiquitination is important for polymerase exchange.","https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.biochem.74.082803.133250",""

These guidelines have differences regarding the duration of such trials: the FDA suggests 2 weeks for SAR and 4 weeks for PAR but the EMEA suggests 2 to 4 weeks for SAR and 6 to 12 weeks for PAR trials. In the interest of global harmonization, it would be desirable to have a uniform duration of such trials so that investigators, internationally, would be able to readily compare results for various types of treatments based on a single standard. Therefore, we performed an evidence‐based review to answer the clinical question, What is the optimal duration for SAR and PAR clinical trials? METHODS:: We performed a MEDLINE search of the published literature from 1995 to the present. We used appropriate search terms, such as allergic rhinitis, seasonal allergic rhinitis, perennial allergic rhinitis, SAR, and PAR, to identify pertinent articles. These articles were reviewed and graded according to the evidence quality. RESULTS:: After an initial screening of more than 300 articles, 138 articles were analyzed thoroughly. No study specifically addressed the question of the optimal duration of SAR or PAR clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS:: We conclude that the current FDA (draft) guidelines calling for a study length of 2 weeks for the assessment of drug efficacy for SAR and 4 weeks for the study of drug efficacy in PAR are appropriate and that longer study periods are not likely to add meaningfully to the assessment of drug efficacy.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1016/j.otohns.2005.07.024",""

It has been shown that EP2 plays a critical role in tumorigenesis in mouse mammary gland and colon. However, the possibility that the EP2 receptor is involved in the development of skin tumors was unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of the EP2 receptor in mouse skin carcinogenesis. Unlike EP3 knockout mice, the EP2 knockout mice produced significantly fewer tumors and reduced tumor incidence compared with wild type (WT) mice in a 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) two-stage carcinogenesis protocol. EP2 knockout mice had significantly reduced cellular proliferation of mouse skin keratinocytes in vivo and in vitro compared with that in WT mice. In addition, the epidermis of EP2 knockout mice 48 hours after topical TPA treatment was significantly thinner compared with that of WT mice. The inflammatory response to TPA was reduced in EP2 knockout mice, based on a reduced number of macrophages in the dermis and a reduced level of interleukin-1α mRNA expression, compared with WT mice. EP2 knockout mice also had significantly reduced epidermal cyclic AMP levels after PGE2 treatment compared with WT mice. Tumors from WT mice produced more blood vessels and fewer apoptotic cells than those of EP2 knockout mice as determined by immunohistochemical staining. Our data suggest that the EP2 receptor plays a significant role in the protumorigenic action of PGE2 in skin tumor development.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/65/20/9304/2868016/9304-9311.pdf",""

Numerical and experimental studies have shown there is a positive improvement (two-fold on average) in Nusselt number when dimpled surfaces are compare to flat plates, and this improvement is achieved with pressure drop penalties that are small when compared to other more intrusive types of turbulence promoters. When arrays of specific dimple geometry are used, pressure drop penalties are roughly equivalent to the heat transfer improvement. This, at least theoretically, will enable the design of smaller heat transfer devices such as heat sinks, which are especially appealing in those applications where size is an important design factor. A literature review of numerical modeling and experiments on flow over dimpled surfaces was performed, and key parameters and flow structure were identified and summarized. With these premises, a numerical model was developed. The model was validated with published experimental data from selected papers and fine-tuned for channel flow within the laminar flow regime. Subsequently, the model was then employed for a specific application to heat sinks for microelectronic cooling. This paper, then, provides a comparative evaluation of dimple technology for improving heat transfer in microelectronic systems.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2005-80163/4564156/697_1.pdf",""

A vortex lattice method (named MPUF3A) is applied to analyze the unsteady cavitating performance of open or ducted propellers subject to non-axisymmetric inflows. A finite volume method based Euler solver (named GBFLOW) is applied to predict the flow field around the open or ducted propellers, coupled with MPUF-3A in order to determine the interaction of the propeller with the inflow (i.e. the effective wake) or with the duct. The blade design of open or ducted propeller is performed by using a constrained nonlinear optimization method (named CAVOPT-BASE), which uses a database of computed performance for a set of blade geometries constructed from a base-propeller. The performance is evaluated using MPUF-3A and GBFLOW. CAVOPT-BASE approximates the database using the least square method or the linear interpolation method, and generates the coefficients of polynomials based on the design parameters, such as pitch, chord, and camber. CAVOPT-BASE finally determines the optimum blade design parameters, so that the propeller produces the desired thrust for the given constraints on the pressure coefficient or the allowed amount of cavitation.","http://onepetro.org/SNAMESMC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.5957/SMC-2005-D28/2453212/sname-smc-2005-d28.pdf",""

Hsp90 functions in concert with a number of cochaperones, including the Hsp110 homolog Sse1. In this report, we demonstrate a novel synthetic genetic interaction between SSE1 and SCH9. This interaction was observed specifically during growth at elevated temperature and was suppressed by decreased signaling through the protein kinase A (PKA) signal transduction pathway. Correspondingly, sse1Δ sch9Δ cells were shown by both genetic and biochemical approaches to have abnormally high levels of PKA activity and were less sensitive to modulation of PKA by glucose availability. Growth defects of an sse1Δ mutant were corrected by reducing PKA signaling through overexpression of negative regulators or growth on nonoptimal carbon sources. Hyperactivation of the PKA pathway through expression of a constitutive RAS2 allele likewise resulted in temperature-sensitive growth, suggesting that modulation of PKA activity during thermal stress is required for adaptation and viability. Together these results demonstrate that the Sse1 chaperone and the growth control kinase Sch9 independently contribute to regulation of PKA signaling.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/170/3/1009/42066535/genetics1009.pdf",""

The actuator is compact enough to fit in the interior of the wing that has a chord of 0.375 m. The wing was tested in the Texas A&M University Aerospace Engineering 3 ft×4 ft wind tunnel. An experimental investigation into the effects of the synthetic jet actuator on the performance of the wing is described. Emphasis is placed on the capabilities of the actuator to control the separation of the flow over the wing at high angles of attack. The results include force balance measurements, on surface and off surface flow visualization, surface pressure measurements, and wake surveys. All of the reported tests were performed at a free-stream velocity of 35 m/s, corresponding to a Reynolds number of 8.96×105. The angle of attack was varied from −2.0 deg to 29.0 deg. For the results presented, at angles of attack lower than 10 deg, the actuator has minimal effects. At higher angles of attack, the SJA delays the onset of stall. The use of the actuator causes an 80% increase in the maximum lift coefficient, while the angle at which stall occurs is increased from 12 to 18 deg. The drag on the wing is decreased as a consequence of SJA actuation. For angles of attack larger than 18 deg, where the wing experiences massive separation, the SJA still provides a moderate amount of lift augmentation compared to the unforced case. At angles of attack larger than 25°, a larger frequency of actuation is required to produce significant effects.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/fluidsengineering/article-pdf/127/2/377/5834207/377_1.pdf",""

We propose that knowledge embedded with a transactive memory system (TMS) helps groups apply prior learning to new tasks and develop an abstract understanding of a problem domain, leading to sustained performance. We present a framework for understanding TMSs as learning systems that affect group learning and learning transfer, and we test the major outcomes of the framework in an empirical study. We found that groups with a prior TMS and experience with two tasks in the same domain were more likely to develop an abstract understanding of the principles relevant to the task domain—a critical factor for learning transfer in general. We did not, however, find strong support for our contention that a TMS facilitates learning transfer after experience with only a single task. Further examinations of our findings showed that the extent to which members maintained expertise across tasks influenced the degree of learning transfer, especially for groups whose members had previously developed a TMS with another group. Our findings show that a TMS has broader benefits beyond the task for which it first developed because a TMS affects members’ ability to apply prior learning and develop a collective, abstract understanding of the task domain. More generally, our study demonstrates that TMSs influence group learning and learning transfer. We discuss our study’s implications for practice and for TMS and group learning theories.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/orsc.1050.0143",""

Although the mechanism is unclear, PI3K activation in these cells could be due to physical interaction between its regulatory subunit (p85) and specific tyrosine kinases or their mediators. Consistent with this possibility, PI3K was precipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies and Akt phosphorylation was blocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors SU6656 and PD158780 in quiescent pancreatic cancer cells. Pull-down assays with a fusion protein (GST-p85NC-SH2), and coimmunoprecipitation studies, indicated that the insulin receptor substrate (IRS), and not the epidermal growth factor and insulin-like growth factor receptors or the Src tyrosine kinase, was physically associated with PI3K in these cells. Our data also indicated that SU6656 and PD158780 inhibited Akt activation in pancreatic cancer cells by interfering with the ability of IRS-1 to recruit PI3K. Furthermore, IRS-1 was phosphorylated on a p85-binding site (Y612), and IRS-specific small interfering RNA potently inhibited activation of PI3K and Akt in transfected cells. Taken together, these observations indicate that IRS is a mediator of PI3K activation in quiescent pancreatic cancer cells.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/65/20/9164/2868308/9164-9168.pdf",""

It is a heterogeneous cancer, and the mechanism of tumorigenesis for the majority of types is unknown. Repressor element-1 silencing transcription/neuron-restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRSF) is a transcriptional repressor that can block transcription of a battery of neuronal differentiation genes by binding to a specific consensus DNA sequence present in their regulatory region. Previously, we found that some medulloblastoma cell lines express REST/NRSF at high levels compared with either neuronal progenitor cells or fully differentiated neurons. However, it is not known if REST/NRSF is indeed overexpressed in human medulloblastoma tumor specimens and in what frequency. Here, we did an immunohistochemical analysis of such tumor specimens using an anti-REST antibody. We show that among 21 human medulloblastoma tumors, 17 expressed REST/NRSF (6 strongly and 11 weakly). In contrast, adjacent normal cerebellum tissue sections and four of the tumor specimens did not express REST/NRSF, indicating that abnormal expression of REST/NRSF is observed in the majority of human medulloblastoma tumors. To determine whether countering REST/NRSF activity blocks tumorigenicity of medulloblastoma cells, especially in the intracranial (i.c.) environment, we found that adenovirus-mediated expression of REST-VP16, a recombinant transcription factor that can compete with REST/NRSF and activate REST/NRSF target genes instead of repressing them, blocked the i.c. tumorigenic potential of medulloblastoma cells and inhibited growth of established tumors in nude mice, suggesting that REST/NRSF may serve as a therapeutic target for medulloblastoma and that forced expression of neuronal differentiation genes in medulloblastoma cells through agents, such as REST-VP16, can interfere with their tumorigenicity.","https://aacrjournals.org/mct/article-pdf/4/3/343/1870026/343-349.pdf",""

The IIp45 gene is located at chromosome 1p36 where frequent deletions have been reported in various types of tumors, including gliomas, raising the possibility that IIp45 may be a classic tumor suppressor gene that can be inactivated by frequent point mutations. To test this hypothesis, we sequenced the IIp45 gene in 59 diffuse glioma samples of different grades and histologic subtypes and identified a possible point mutation or a rare polymorphism in only one sample (1.7%), suggesting that IIp45 is not a classic tumor suppressor gene such as p53. Instead, reverse transcription-PCR and subsequent sequencing results revealed a tumor-specific IIp45 spliced isoform (IIp45S) in 20 of 59 (34%) gliomas examined, particularly in glioblastoma multiformes, including native tissue samples (15 of 25; 60%) and cell lines (5 of 5; 100%). The alternative splicing event is independent of 1p36 deletion, which is not common in glioblastoma multiforme. The IIp45S transcript was not detected in any of 18 normal organs, including fetal and adult brain. We determined that the IIp45S isoform results from exclusion of IIp45 exon 7 and encodes a variant protein that carries a COOH terminus different from that of IIp45 due to a frame-shift mutation. IIp45S protein was undetectable in glioma tissues, although IIp45S mRNA was prevalent. We found that IIp45S, once translated, is rapidly degraded by an ubiquitin-proteasome mechanism. Thus, the IIp45 gene is inactivated by a tumor-specific alternative splicing that generates an aberrant and unstable IIp45 isoform in infiltrative gliomas.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/65/9/3562/2865421/3562-3567.pdf",""

Localization of HA in the skin is assessed by histology with HA-binding protein (HABP) serving as the probe. Reports have suggested that HA expression in skin is altered in a number of diseases. However, interlaboratory variations in HABP staining profiles, even in normal skin, suggest a need to standardize methods and/or identify new probes. We report the staining patterns of a HA-binding peptide (termed “Pep-1”) in human and mouse skin. After acetone fixation, Pep-1 stained HA in the intercellular spaces of the epidermis, whereas staining in the dermis was weak and diffuse in both human and mouse skin. HABP staining of the epidermis and dermis were comparable in human skin but failed to stain the vital epidermis of mouse skin. In human skin, Pep-1 stained the basal, spinous, and granular layers, whereas HABP failed to stain the basal layer. Precipitation of HA in situ resulted in dermal staining but weak staining in the epidermis for HABP and Pep-1. Our results may suggest that Pep-1 is sensitive to HA conformation.

Rich and complex non-linear behaviours displayed at different rotor speeds, relative flexibility (embodying the extent of surface crack development), and film clearances are studied employing the fundamental concept of instantaneous frequency. Acquired results show that the model system responds differently to two sources of non-linearity than to only one. The presence of surface fatigue cracks generates various prominent effects at low speeds and dominates non-linear instability response at high speeds. In addition, smaller bearing clearances are seen not only to induce smaller rotor vibration amplitude subject to cracking opening but also to bring about more bifurcations.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1243/146441905X9971",""

Growth of channel catfish ages 3 through 6 was negatively related to longitude, a factor that explained as much as 34% of the variation in length at age. Channel catfish length at age was not significantly related to latitude, conductivity, morphoedaphic index, mean depth, and maximum depth in all age‐classes. Among age‐7 channel catfish, length at age was positively related to reservoir area, which explained 35% of the variation in growth. A quadratic model for growing‐season length explained 7–17% of the variation in length at age in all age‐classes. Overall, length at age for channel catfish was greatest in reservoirs with intermediate growing seasons (approximately 270 d in length) and was lower when the growing‐season length was either longer or shorter.

This enzyme is also expressed in epithelia in a variety of extraintestinal tissues. The newly discovered β-carotene 9', 10'-monooxygenase (BCO2) catalyzes asymmetric cleavage of carotenoids. To gain some insight into the physiological role of BCO2, we determined the expression pattern of BCO2 mRNA and protein in human tissues. By immunohistochemical analysis it was revealed that BCO2 was detected in cell types that are known to express BCO1, such as epithelial cells in the mucosa of small intestine and stomach, parenchymal cells in liver, Leydig and Sertoli cells in testis, kidney tubules, adrenal gland, exocrine pancreas, and retinal pigment epithelium and ciliary body pigment epithelia in the eye. BCO2 was uniquely detected in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells, prostate and endometrial connective tissue, and endocrine pancreas. The finding that the BCO2 enzyme was expressed in some tissues and cell types that are not sensitive to vitamin A deficiency and where no BCO1 has been detected suggests that BCO2 may also be involved in biological processes other than vitamin A synthesis.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1369/jhc.5A6705.2005",""

The purpose here is to present some modeling and benefit–cost analysis results from that study, with a focus on the results from a particular data set developed under a cross-sectional with–without study design.

The models employed to estimate median-related crash frequencies and severities, including the Poisson-gamma and ordered multinomial logit models as well as modeling results from a full Bayes estimation method, are presented. From the modeling results, a preliminary benefit–cost analysis is described, in conjunction with some sensitivity analyses, for developing the guidelines for concrete and high-tension-cable barriers.

However, retinoic acid resistance limits the chemotherapeutic potential of ATRA. We examined the ability of retinol to inhibit the growth of ATRA-sensitive (HCT-15) and ATRA-resistant (HCT-116, SW620, and WiDR) human colon cancer cell lines. Retinol inhibited cell growth in a dose-responsive manner. Retinol was not metabolized to ATRA or any bioactive retinoid in two of the cell lines examined. HCT-116 and WiDR cells converted a small amount of retinol to ATRA; however, this amount of ATRA was unable to inhibit cell growth. To show that retinol was not inducing RARE-mediated transcription, each cell line was transfected with pRARE-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and treated with ATRA and retinol. Although treatment with ATRA increased CAT activity 5-fold in ATRA-sensitive cells, retinol treatment did not increase CAT activity in any cell line examined. To show that growth inhibition due to retinol was ATRA, RAR, and RARE independent, a pan-RAR antagonist was used to block RAR signaling. Retinol-induced growth inhibition was not alleviated by the RAR antagonist in any cell line, but the antagonist alleviated ATRA-induced growth inhibition of HCT-15 cells. Retinol did not induce apoptosis, differentiation or necrosis, but affected cell cycle progression. Our data show that retinol acts through a novel, RAR-independent mechanism to inhibit colon cancer cell growth.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/65/21/9923/2866077/9923-9933.pdf",""
