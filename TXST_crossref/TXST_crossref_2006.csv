A 3 independent groups design was employed using rumination as the independent variable. Group 1 was given a situation in which anger-related self-rumination was introduced. Group 2 was given a self-related rumination task in which anger was not induced. Group 3 received a rumination task not related to the self. In addition, the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory was given prior to the experiment to test the hypothesis that ratings on the Anger-In subtest would correlate with pain sensitivity. In each group were 6 men and 6 women. Each participant took the anger and another inventory not relevant to the present study before the experiment. An anger measure was taken before and after the experiment for each group to see if the anger induction in Group 1 actually increased anger. There were no differences among the 3 groups on the second anger measure, so differences between Groups 1 and 2 could not be attributed to anger. A 1-way analysis of variance for 3 groups showed a strong main effect on pain tolerance but not pain sensitivity. Groups 1 and 2 were significantly more tolerant of pain than Group 3. The correlation of ratings on the Anger-In (internalized anger) subtest fell short of statistical significance with pain sensitivity and also was not significant for pain tolerance. Results were discussed in terms of the possibility that self-rumination may increase pain tolerance by requiring a greater cognitive load than nonself rumination.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2466/pms.103.1.21-28",""

Presumably, religious-affiliated, government, and private secular nonprofit facilities pursue similar objectives, perform similarly, and receive tax exemptions accordingly. Using modified, translog cost-and profit-function regression analyses, this article rejects the hypothesis of homogeneous performance. In Texas, private secular nonprofit nursing homes are the most cost-efficient, followed by religious-affiliated and then government nursing facilities. When allocation efficiency is also considered, government and private secular facilities have similar overall economic efficiency; religious-affiliated and government facilities are similar as well; however, private secular facilities are significantly more efficient than religious-affiliated homes. Quality appears to be homogeneous among facility classifications. Given these significant differences, policy makers may want to consider the role of relative economic performance when granting nonprofit status to nursing facilities because nonprofit governance boards may allow their organizations to pursue the “socially superior” goal somewhat divergently.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0899764006289770",""

Purpose: To identify any rural/urban differences in access and barriers to health services, including MS-focused care, among people with MS. Methods: The data were collected in a survey of 1,518 people with MS living in all 50 States. The study included three geographic subgroups: urban areas; adjacent rural areas; and more remote rural areas. Findings: We found significant rural/urban differences in access and barriers to care among people with MS, especially for MS-focused care. Significantly smaller proportions of people with MS from adjacent and more remote rural areas reported no difficulty getting MS-related care than their urban counterparts. Conclusions: Greater difficulty accessing MS-related care experienced by people with MS in rural areas has negative implications for the quality of the MS care they receive.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/107937390602900301",""

Textile composites are considered when out-of-plane properties are also important. Textile composites generally have better dimensional stability, out-of-plane properties, and impact and delamination resistance. The natural conformability of biaxial braids makes them more cost competitive than woven fabric. These material systems are gaining popularity, in particular for the small business jets, where FAA requires take off weights of 5670 kgf or less. The vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) process has proven to be low in cost compared to resin transfer molding (RTM). Thus, the combination of biaxial braids and the VARTM process is likely to considerably reduce overall costs. Before the braids can be confidently used in the primary structures, it is necessary to understand the performance of biaxial braided composites under various loading conditions and especially under fatigue. This will reduce uncertainty and hence reduce the factor of safety in the design This research addresses viscoelastic effects on fatigue behavior of carbon/epoxy braided composites. It is observed that braided composites exhibit creep and stress relaxation. Further it is observed that frequency in axial fatigue loading plays dominant role in fatigue life, but very little role in fatigue failure mechanisms. Rate of stiffness degradation is greatly affected by frequency. These entire phenomena such as creep, stress relaxation, frequency effect, and dependency of stiffness on rate of loading indicate the viscoelastic behavior of braided composites. In this research different tests were performed to confirm viscoelastic behavior of braided composites. Axial tension-tension fatigue tests were conducted at different frequencies and stiffness degradation was studied.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2006-14091/4565535/711_1.pdf",""

This learning depends on a form of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-mediated plasticity. Instrumental training enables subsequent learning, and this effect has been linked to the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Rats given uncontrollable stimulation later exhibit impaired instrumental learning, and this deficit lasts up to 48 hr. The induction of the deficit can be blocked by prior training with controllable shock, the concurrent presentation of a tonic stimulus that induces antinociception, or pretreatment with an NMDA or gamma-aminobutyric acid-A antagonist. The expression of the deficit depends on a kappa opioid. Uncontrollable stimulation enhances mechanical reactivity (allodynia), and treatments that induce allodynia (e.g., inflammation) inhibit learning. In intact animals, descending serotonergic neurons exert a protective effect that blocks the adverse consequences of uncontrollable stimulation. Uncontrollable, but not controllable, stimulation impairs the recovery of function after a contusion injury.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1534582306289738",""

Plane wave decomposition was used to modify the reflection coefficient models to include the inherent spherical effects such as lateral wave interference for direct comparison with the data. Sets of data at two transducer separation distances (1.27 and 0.25m) were collected to compare the range dependence of the spherical effects. Bandpass filtered linear frequency-modulated chirps from 30 to 160kHz were used to measure frequency dependence. Grazing angles from 5° to 75° were measured to compare angle dependence. Each set of data was collected along approximately 3m of smoothed sediment for spatial averaging. Unavoidable experimental effects including transducer response, beam pattern, and spherical spreading were accounted for in order to compare the reflection coefficient measurements with the modified models. Significant spherical wave effects were measured in the data. Three reflection coefficient models were considered: the viscoelastic model, the grain shearing model [M. Buckingham, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 108, 1796–2815 (2000)] and the effective density fluid model [K. Williams, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 110, 2276–2281 (2001)]. The viscoelastic and grain shearing models predicted values for the reflection coefficient that were not within the 95% confidence interval for low frequencies. The data exhibited high variance which was frequency and angle dependent. This variance is not likely to be caused by variations in bulk properties as defined by the fluid or viscoelastic models. The cause of the variance will be considered in subsequent publications.","https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article-pdf/120/5/2437/13698005/2437_1_online.pdf",""

In the temperature range of the measurements, the translational relaxation functions were observed to decay exponentially, indicating that Fick’s law of diffusion governs the translational motion of rubrene in sucrose benzoate. The value of the translational diffusion coefficient DT obtained from the 1∕e time of the translational relaxation function varied from 5.3×10−15cm2s−1 at 343 K to 5.0×10−9cm2s−1 at 408 K.

The pulsed plasma duty cycle (on/off) resulted in slightly higher dielectric constant DCTMDS films for higher duty cycles. The variation of dielectric constants does not show any trend with varying film thicknesses, indicating that the thickness of the deposited films is not significant for controlling permittivity. Postdeposition annealing in a certain temperature range improves the electrical integrity of PPP DCTMDS films, but temperatures that are too high induce even higher leakage than the samples with no heat treatment.

Results indicate that among young women and non-Latino/a white adolescents, four aspects of parental involvement—shared dinnertime, participation in shared activities, relationship quality, and communication about sex—are significantly and independently related to sexual initiation. When these young people have positive relationships with their parents, share mealtimes, and participate in shared activities, they are less likely to initiate sex. With a few exceptions, these parenting practices are not related to sexual debut among young men or African American and Latino/a adolescents.

IYSV was first reported in the United States from Idaho in 1993 and has since spread to many of the onion-producing areas (1). In South America, the most recent reports of the virus on onion were from Peru and Chile (2,4). In 2005, onion plants in Uvalde County, Texas exhibited necrotic lesions on leaves typical of IYSV and disease incidence approached 100% in some fields with yield loss and quality problems. Five of six plants tested were positive for IYSV with double antibody sandwich-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA; Agdia Inc., Elkhart, IN). In 2006, similar lesions were observed on onion plants in Uvalde County and approximately 400 km south in Hidalgo and Cameron counties. Infection points generally started as a single plant near the edge of fields and spread to plants in a 3- to 4-m area after 1 to 2 weeks. Early-season disease incidence was low in onions grown for bulbs and transplants, <10% in 2006. Disease incidence increased in some fields until the crop was harvested. Leaves of symptomatic plants were tested for IYSV and Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) using DAS-ELISA, and 18 of 23 samples from the Hidalgo County area and 12 of 21 samples from the Uvalde County area were positive for IYSV. All samples tested for TSWV from these counties were negative. Virus infection in some ELISA-positive plants was verified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using primers derived from the small RNA of IYSV. The primers flanked the IYSV nucleocapsid (N) gene (5′-TAA AAC AAA CAT TCA AAC AA-3′ and 5′-CTC TTA AAC ACA TTT AAC AAG CAC-3′ (3). RT-PCR gave a PCR product of expected size (approximately 1.2 kb). The DNA amplicon was cloned and sequenced (GenBank Accession No. DQ658242). Nucleotide sequence analysis confirmed the identity of the amplicon as that of IYSV N gene and sequence comparisons with known IYSV N gene sequences showed 95 to 98% sequence identity. The primary vector of IYSV, onion thrips (Thrips tabaci), is a widespread and destructive pest of onion in south Texas. The year-to-year incidence of IYSV and the severity of the disease will probably depend on the onion thrips population levels. Bulb yield reduction could be severe during years with high thrips populations. More research is needed to determine the impact of IYSV on bulb yield in Texas, the relationship between IYSV incidence and T. tabaci population levels, and oversummering hosts. To our knowledge, this is the first known report of IYSV in Texas.","https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/abs/10.1094/PD-90-1359B",""

Logistic regression is also employed to further assess group membership (male and female). Females were typically younger than males at the time of their arrest for a sex offense. Female offenders also chose male and female victims proportionately, whereas males were more likely to choose female victims. Logistic regression analysis revealed two significant predictors of the offender's sex: victim's sex and length of sentence.

The study focuses on post-bellum regulations that disproportionately affected African Americans and the historical contexts in which the regulations were written. Historically, African Americans of all socioeconomic backgrounds have maintained an implicit mistrust of government regulations and the government officials who write them. The justification for this mistrust is deeply rooted in the fact that for decades regulations were not written to protect the rights of African Americans nor was their input considered in regulatory writing. In Communicating Across Cultures, Stella Ting-Toomey argues, “if conflict parties do not trust each other, they tend to move away (cognitively, affectively and physically) from each other rather than struggle side by side in negotiation” [1, p. 222].

Our analysis of grade 7 through 12 students revealed a gender reversal in school attachment only among whites; although gender differences at each grade level were quite small, the larger differences among girls produced the reversal pattern. Self-esteem, depressive symptoms, and relationships with parents appear to be key factors tied to this reversal but ultimately do not account for grade level differences among girls. We also found that the paradoxical coupling of girls' higher achievement with lower attachment in the upper grades resulted from a weaker association between attachment and achievement among girls than among boys, especially in the upper grades.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/019027250606900305",""

While traditional agency theory argues that agency costs are minimized in a family–controlled business (FCB) due to an improved alignment of owner and manager interests, we argue instead that FCBs endure additional agency costs uniquely related to the family firm organizational structure. To mitigate these additional costs, we propose that FCBs use board interlocks to build and maintain community–level social capital. That is, the intercorporate network of FCBs generates shared understandings, values, problem solving techniques, and approaches to dealing with family issues. Further, the network generates a level of social support for family business owners and managers grappling with challenges endemic to family control of public corporations. We generate a number of propositions that can be used in future research to test the theory developed here. We conclude with the assertion that the community–level social capital generated by the network of FCBs is an important reason for the survival and persistence of individual family firms, despite the existence of additional family–related costs.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1540-6520.2006.00149.x",""

A wavelet‐transform‐based method was developed to determine and characterize melt occurrences. About 9–12% of the Antarctic surface experiences melt annually. This is more than twice the surface melt extent measured in Greenland. Seasonally, surface melt primarily takes place in December, January, and February and peaks in early January. Regression analysis over the 25 year period of study reveals a negative interannual trend in surface melt. Nevertheless, the trend inference is not statistically significant. Large year‐to‐year fluctuations characterize the interannual variability. Extremely high melt occurred in the 1982/1983 and 1991/1992 summers, while extremely weak melt occurred in the 1999/2000 summer. A strong correlation with air temperature suggests that the melt index can serve as a diagnostic indicator for regional temperature variations. Periodic melting has been observed over Ross Ice Shelf, Ronne‐Filchner Ice Shelf, the West Antarctic ice streams, and outlet glaciers in the Transantarctic Mountains. The Antarctic Peninsula, West Ice Shelf, Shackleton Ice Shelf, Amery Ice Shelf, and the ice shelf along the Princess Ragnhild Coast experienced the most persistent and intensive melt and should be closely monitored for their stability in the future, given the recent disintegration of the Larsen Ice Shelf A and B.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2005JF000318",""

The research question is whether this minor league team will be successful in attracting attendance over an extended period of time. An important financial issue is if the team is predicted to fail, then exactly how long will it last? A variety of methods are used in a step-by-step procedure to evaluate this viability. We first test whether attendance is evolving or stable through a unit root test, a test of market persistence. We then use the Bass model to assess whether the projected product life cycle is turning up or down. The Gompertz and logistic (Pearl) diffusion curves are next applied to home stand data of various lengths in order to make forecasts of an eventual dissolution point at which the team would financially collapse. Market saturation is not estimated, but set at the stadium capacity. Forecasting principles involving diffusion models are implemented. Analogies are used as a complementary forecasting technique to assess whether there is long-term potential for survival. Finally, logistic regression on cross-sectional data is used to supplement the forecasts. The results of the triangulation of diffusion curves, analogies, and logistic regression predict a decline in the minor league team’s ability to capture attendance.","https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/jsm/20/2/article-p248.xml",""

Past studies have also examined peer influence on adolescent behaviors, but have largely ignored the effect of best friends. The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (1995) reports that higher levels of family involvement and best friend interaction were related to lowering the odds of engaging in risky sexual activities. Higher levels of family involvement and best friend interaction increased the likelihood of using contraception during intercourse and early sexual activity among adolescents. The effects varied by gender. Programs that are intended to reduce the chances of sexual risk can potentially encourage activities with parents and close friends.

Although much has been learned about the immune response of mice using an attenuated live vaccine strain (LVS) derived from F. tularensis subspecies holarctica (Type B), little is known about the responses of human monocyte-derived immature dendritic cells (DC). Here, we show that optimal phagocytosis of LVS by DC is dependent on serum opsonization. We demonstrate that complement factor C3-derived opsonins and the major complement receptors expressed by DC, the integrins CR3 (CD11b/CD18) and CR4 (CD11c/CD18), play a critical role in this adhesion-mediated phagocytosis. LVS induced proinflammatory cytokine production and up-regulation of costimulatory surface proteins (CD40, CD86, and MHC Class II) on DC but resisted killing. Once taken up, LVS grew intracellularly, resulting in DC death. DC maturation and cytokine production were induced by direct contact/phagocytosis of LVS or interaction with soluble products of the bacteria, and enhanced activation was seen when LVS was pretreated with serum. Sonicated LVS and supernatants from LVS cultures were potent activators of DC, but LVS LPS failed to activate DC maturation or cytokine production. Serum-treated LVS rapidly induced (within 6 h) a number of cytokines including IL-10, a potent suppressor of macrophage functions and down-regulator of Th1-like responses and the Th1 response inducer IL-12. These results suggest that the simultaneous production of an activating (IL-12, IL-1β, and TNF-α) and a suppressing (IL-10) cytokine profile could contribute to the immunopathogenesis of tularemia.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1189%2Fjlb.1205755",""

Moreover, for firms with less than US$1m in revenues, a high priority is placed on selecting a successor who possesses strong sales and marketing skills.

The approach is based on Driving Pattern Recognition (DPR). The Equivalent (fuel) Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS) method provides real-time suboptimal energy management decisions by minimizing the ""equivalent"" fuel consumption of a hybrid-electric vehicle. The equivalent fuel consumption is a combination of the actual fuel consumption and electrical energy use, and an equivalence factor is used to convert electrical power used into an equivalent chemical fuel quantity. In this research, a driving pattern recognition method is used to obtain better estimation of the equivalence factor under different driving conditions. A time window of past driving conditions is analyzed periodically and recognized as one of the Representative Driving Patterns (RDPs). Periodically updating the control parameter according to the driving conditions yields more precise estimation of the equivalent fuel consumption cost, thus providing better fuel economy. Besides minimizing the instantaneous equivalent fuel consumption, the battery State of Charge (SOC) management is also maintained by using a PI controller to keep the SOC around a nominal value. The primary improvement of the proposed A-ECMS over other algorithms with similar objectives is that it does not require the knowledge of future driving cycles and has a low computational burden. Results obtained in this research show that the driving conditions can be successfully recognized and good performance can be achieved in various driving conditions while sustaining battery SOC within desired limits.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2006-13951/4575262/249_1.pdf",""

Low cost replication of the microtiter plates is done using micro molding techniques, so microfabrication technology for making large area mold inserts (LAMIs) containing microfluidic devices at each well of a microtiter plate format is needed. A large area mold insert (LAMI) in the footprint of the standard microtiter plate was fabricated using an SU-8 based UV-LIGA technique. Excellent lithography results, with vertical sidewalls, were obtained by utilizing flycutting to minimize SU-8 film thickness variation and a UV filter for attenuating high absorbance UV wavelengths. Overplating of nickel in the SU-8 polymeric molds was used to make high quality metallic mold inserts with vertical sidewalls. Micro molding of polycarbonate (PC) was done using hot embossing, resulting in good replication fidelity over the large surface area. Thermal fusion bonding of the molded PC chips yielded good sealing results and the developed polymer microfluidic platforms showed good fluidic uniformity.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2006-15275/2782263/209_1.pdf",""

The murine double-minute protein MDM2 and its homologue MDM4 (also known as MDMX) are critical regulators of p53. Altered transcripts of the human homologue of mdm2, MDM2, have been identified in human tumors, such as invasive carcinoma of the breast, lung carcinoma, and liposarcoma. MDM2 alternate forms act to negatively regulate the normal MDM2 gene product, thus activating p53. Although many reports have documented a plethora of tumor types characterized by MDM2 alternative transcripts, few have investigated the signals that might initiate alternative splicing. We have identified a novel role of these alternative MDM2 transcripts in the normal surveillance mechanism of the cell and in DNA damage response. We report that alternate forms of MDM2 are detected after UV irradiation. Furthermore, we show that mouse cells treated with UV are also characterized by alternative transcripts of mdm2, suggesting that this is an important and evolutionarily conserved mechanism for regulating the expression of MDM2/mdm2. An additional p53 regulator and mdm2 family member, MDM4, is likewise alternatively spliced following UV irradiation. By activating alternative splicing of both MDM2 and MDM4, yet another layer of p53 regulation is initiated by the cells in response to damage. A stepwise model for malignant conversion by which alternate forms of MDM2 and MDM4 place selective pressure on the cells to acquire additional alterations in the p53 pathway is herein proposed.

The resulting [Formula: see text] function gives a good approximation to a constant [Formula: see text] over the chosen frequency band. The algorithm is combined with a finite-difference (F-D) code that includes topographies in 3D seismic media. The velocity-stress formulation for viscoelastic wave modeling is used with an arbitrary number of relaxation mechanisms to model a desired [Formula: see text] behavior. These equations are discretized by high-order F-Ds in the interior of the medium, and we gradually reduce the F-D order to two at the stress-free surface, where we implement our free-surface boundary conditions. The seismic F-D algorithm is applied to a marine seismic experiment, with and without viscoelasticity, to emphasize the importance of including physical attenuation and dispersion in seismic modeling. Their inclusion, even for marine surveys, is clearly important for lossy ocean bottoms.

The manufacturer and the distributor each has an ideal schedule, determined by cost and capacity considerations. However, these two schedules are in general not well coordinated, which leads to poor overall performance. In this context, we study two practical problems. In both problems, the manufacturer focuses on minimizing unproductive time. The distributor minimizes customer cost measures in the first problem and minimizes inventory holding cost in the second problem. We first evaluate each party's conflict, which is the relative increase in cost that results from using the other party's optimal schedule. Since this conflict is often significant, we consider several practical scenarios about the level of cooperation between the manufacturer and the distributor. These scenarios define various scheduling problems for the manufacturer, the distributor, and the overall system. For each of these scheduling problems, we provide an algorithm. We demonstrate that the cost saving provided by cooperation between the decision makers is usually significant. Finally, we discuss the implications of our work for how manufacturers and distributors negotiate, coordinate, and implement their supply chain schedules in practice.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2006.tb00243.x",""

Patients and Methods: Five hundred ninety-five US women age 20 to 45 years were accrued from January 1998 to July 2002 within 8 months of diagnosis with stages I to III breast cancer (median follow-up 45 months). Daily bleeding records were obtained prospectively, as well as extensive clinical, demographic, quality of life, and treatment data. Repeated measures logistic regression was used to assess which variables were predictive of monthly bleeding. Results: Significantly different proportions of women had monthly bleeding depending on their age (P < .001), chemotherapy program (P < .001), and time since treatment regimen. In the month after the standard course of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC), whether or not followed by paclitaxel or docetaxel, approximately 16% had monthly bleeding compared with the cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil (CMF) group, in which 48% bled (P < .001). Following any AC regimen, there was a slow recovery phase of about 9 months followed by a plateau, during which almost half continued monthly bleeding for the remainder of the follow-up period compared with after CMF in which there was no recovery phase and a continual decline in monthly bleeding to approximately 18% of women at study end (P < .001). Tamoxifen use decreased bleeding between months 12 and 24 after chemotherapy with 15% fewer women having bleeding. Conclusion: Using daily menstrual bleeding records, it is demonstrated that age, the specific chemotherapy regimen received, and tamoxifen use impact ovarian function.","https://ascopubs.org/doi/pdfdirect/10.1200/JCO.2005.03.3969",""

We examined the application of SEM in 109 strategic-management studies and found that equivalent models are a cause for concern in most strategic-management studies.

Principles of roadside barrier use for permanent roadways will be covered. Also covered will be benefit–cost analysis and adaptation of permanent roadway procedures and programs, specifically the Roadside Safety Analysis Program (RSAP), for the purpose of developing work zone barrier guidance. Results show that the modeling of specific work zone scenarios and development of generalized barrier placement guidance for practitioners based on cost-effective principles are both feasible. This type of analysis can be done by adapting algorithms in RSAP intended for permanent roadway analysis to construction work zones. General guidelines similar to the median barrier warrants for permanent roadways in the Roadside Design Guide were developed for construction work zones. In addition, it was concluded that current encroachment models and crash severity indexes may not be well suited for permanent roadways or construction work zones.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0361198106198400103",""

Chemical investigation of the roots and leaves of this plant has yielded bioactive withanolides. Earlier studies showed that withanolides inhibit cyclooxygenase enzymes, lipid peroxidation, and proliferation of tumor cells. Because several genes that regulate cellular proliferation, carcinogenesis, metastasis, and inflammation are regulated by activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), we hypothesized that the activity of withanolides is mediated through modulation of NF-κB activation. For this report, we investigated the effect of the withanolide on NF-κB and NF-κB-regulated gene expression activated by various carcinogens. We found that withanolides suppressed NF-κB activation induced by a variety of inflammatory and carcinogenic agents, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1β, doxorubicin, and cigarette smoke condensate. Suppression was not cell type specific, as both inducible and constitutive NF-κB activation was blocked by withanolides. The suppression occurred through the inhibition of inhibitory subunit of IκBα kinase activation, IκBα phosphorylation, IκBα degradation, p65 phosphorylation, and subsequent p65 nuclear translocation. NF-κB-dependent reporter gene expression activated by TNF, TNF receptor (TNFR) 1, TNFR-associated death domain, TNFR-associated factor 2, and IκBα kinase was also suppressed. Consequently, withanolide suppressed the expression of TNF-induced NF-κB-regulated antiapoptotic (inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1, Bfl-1/A1, and FADD-like interleukin-1β-converting enzyme–inhibitory protein) and metastatic (cyclooxygenase-2 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1) gene products, enhanced the apoptosis induced by TNF and chemotherapeutic agents, and suppressed cellular TNF-induced invasion and receptor activator of NF-κB ligand-induced osteoclastogenesis. Overall, our results indicate that withanolides inhibit activation of NF-κB and NF-κB-regulated gene expression, which may explain the ability of withanolides to enhance apoptosis and inhibit invasion and osteoclastogenesis.

Our analysis of longitudinal data from 65 democracies reveals that presidential and parliamentary governments create different patterns of government survival. Ruling parties in parliamentary systems encounter a declining hazard rate over time, whereas those in presidentialism face an increasing hazard rate in their survival. We explain this difference by focusing on how parliamentary and presidential systems create different incentive structures for political parties.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0010414005284047",""

In a recent study, Yan et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 130604 (2005)] identified a spherically symmetric two-scale potential that displays many of the same anomalous properties as water. More specifically, for select parametrizations of the potential, one finds that the regions where isothermal compression anomalously (i) decreases the fluid’s structural order, (ii) increases its translational self-diffusivity, and (iii) increases its entropy form nested domes in the temperature-density plane. These property relationships are similar to those found for more realistic models of water. In this work, the authors provide evidence that suggests that the anomalous regions specified above can all be linked through knowledge of the excess entropy. Specifically, the authors show how entropy scaling relationships developed by Rosenfeld [Phys. Rev.

The subglacial environment changes from no‐sediment to discontinuous‐sediment to continuous‐sediment cover along a longitudinal profile from the ice sheet to tributary C1B. Along this same profile, we observe a speedup of ice flow and then full development of the ice stream tributary. Ice stream D flows above a thick sedimentary package with an uppermost low‐seismic‐velocity zone indicative of soft till, and the upglacier and lateral extensions of ice stream D are tightly constrained by the extent of continuous sediments.

The microbes that produce methane were examined in permanently cold, anoxic marine sediments at Hydrate Ridge (44°35' N, 125°10' W, depth 800 m). Sediment samples (15 to 35 cm deep) were collected from areas of active methane ebullition or areas where methane hydrates occurred. The samples were diluted into enrichment medium with formate, acetate or trimethylamine as catabolic substrate. After 2 years of incubation at 4 °C to 15 °C, enrichment cultures produced methane. PCR amplification and sequencing of the rRNA genes from the highest dilutions with growth suggested that each enrichment culture contained a single strain of methanogen. The level of sequence similarity (91 to 98%) to previously characterized prokaryotes suggested that these methanogens belonged to novel genera or species within the orders Methanomicrobiales and Methanosarcinales. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene libraries from DNA extracted directly from the sediment samples revealed phylotypes that were either distantly related to cultivated methanogens or possible anaerobic methane oxidizers related to the ANME-1 and ANME-2 groups of the Archaea. However, no methanogenic sequences were detected, suggesting that methanogens represented only a small proportion of the archaeal community.","http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/archaea/2006/710190.pdf",""

N-(4-Methoxyphenyl)retinamide (4-MPR) is the most abundant metabolite of 4-HPR detected in human serum following 4-HPR therapy. We have shown in in vitro studies that 4-HPR and 4-MPR can act independent of the classic nuclear retinoid receptor pathway and that 4-HPR, but not 4-MPR, can also activate nuclear retinoid receptors. In this study, we have compared the chemopreventive effects of topically applied 4-HPR and 4-MPR with the primary biologically active retinoid, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), in vivo in the mouse skin two-stage chemical carcinogenesis model. All three retinoids suppressed tumor formation but the effect of 4-HPR and 4-MPR, and not of ATRA, was sustained after their discontinuation. The tumor-suppressive effects of 4-HPR and 4-MPR were quantitatively and qualitatively similar, suggesting that the two may be acting through the same retinoid receptor–independent mechanism(s). We further explored this effect in vitro by analyzing primary cultures of mouse keratinocytes treated with the same retinoids. All three could induce apoptosis with a 48-hour treatment and only ATRA and 4-HPR induced an accumulation of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. This finding is consistent with our previous results showing that the effects of phenylretinamides on the cell cycle are retinoid receptor dependent whereas apoptosis induction is not. A microarray-based comparison of gene expression profiles for mouse skin treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) alone and TPA + 4-HPR or TPA + 4-MPR reveals a high degree of coincidence between the genes regulated by the two phenylretinamides. We propose that 4-HPR may exert therapeutic and chemopreventive effects by acting primarily through a retinoid receptor–independent mechanism(s) and that 4-MPR may contribute to the therapeutic effect of 4-HPR by acting through the same retinoid receptor–independent mechanism(s).","https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article-pdf/12/3/969/1966776/969.pdf",""

Method: A comprehensive search of the literature published between 1975 and 2003, which included data on speech production before, during, and after AAC intervention, was conducted using a combination of electronic and hand searches. Results: The review identified 23 studies, involving 67 individuals. Seventeen of these studies did not establish experimental control, thereby limiting the certainty of evidence about speech outcomes. The remaining 6 studies, involving 27 cases, had sufficient methodological rigor for the “best evidence analysis” (cf. R. E. Slavin, 1986). Most of the participants (aged 2–60 years) had mental retardation or autism; the AAC interventions involved instruction in manual signs or nonelectronic aided systems. None of the 27 cases demonstrated decreases in speech production as a result of AAC intervention, 11% showed no change, and the majority (89%) demonstrated gains in speech. For the most part, the gains observed were modest, but these data may underestimate the effect of AAC intervention on speech production because there were ceiling effects. Conclusions: Future research is needed to better delineate the relationship between AAC intervention and speech production across a wider range of participants and AAC interventions.","http://pubs.asha.org/doi/pdf/10.1044/1092-4388%282006/021%29",""

This system uses advance detection to obtain real-time information about the presence and speeds of individual vehicles. Its algorithm identifies whether a platoon—of a user-specified minimum size and density—is approaching the signal and estimates platoon arrival time at the stop bar. When warranted, the system issues a low-priority preemption signal to progress the detected platoon. Duration of the initial preemption signal is based on estimated arrival and departure times for the smallest acceptable platoon and the estimated time needed to clear any queues present at the signal. Then, the system switches to an extension mode and provides progression to any additional vehicles determined to be in the platoon. It accomplishes that by increasing preemption time until no more vehicles are determined to be in the platoon or until the max timer expires. The system also ensures that the last progressed vehicle is not trapped in its dilemma zone. The platoon identification and accommodation system can be implemented by retrofitting existing National Electrical Manufacturers Association cabinets.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0361198106197800118",""

Using these results, an exchange model of the proximity effect in ferromagnet/superconductor (F/S) nanostructures is proposed. The mutual accommodation of inhomogeneous superconducting and magnetic order parameters in the F/S nanostructures is studied within the framework of this model. It is shown that F/S nanostructures of the first type allow only the presence of homogeneous ferromagnetic ordering in the F layers that coexists with superconductivity in the S layers if the exchange fields h are lower than a critical field hc. It is found that in the F/S nanostructures of the second type for exchange fields h between hc1 and hc2, where hc1(2) is the lower (upper) critical exchange field, a nonuniform cryptoferromagnetic modulation is induced in the spin structure of the F films. The conditions for the coexistence of inhomogeneous magnetism and superconductivity in the F/S nanostructures EuO∕Al, EuO∕V, EuS∕Al, and LaCaMnO∕YBaCuO are explored.

However, resistance to endocrine therapy, either inherent or acquired during treatment, presents a major challenge in disease management. The causes of resistance to hormone therapy are not well understood and are the subject of active investigation. It is increasingly clear that decreasing sensitivity of ER-positive breast cancer cells to antiestrogens is caused by several factors. Cross talk between ER and growth factor signaling has emerged as a critical factor in endocrine resistance. Here, we present evidence that receptor tyrosine kinase signaling also plays a role in resistance by controlling the subcellular localization of ER signaling components. Localization of ER in either the nuclear or cytoplasmic compartments has functional implications. Recent work suggests that dynein light chain 1, a recently identified substrate of p21-activated kinase 1, modulates ER transactivation functions through a novel ER coactivator function. Likewise, receptor tyrosine kinase signaling can also alter the expression of ER coregulators such as metastasis-associated antigen 1, leading to hormonal independence. Furthermore, proline-, glutamic acid-, leucine-rich protein 1, an ER coactivator involved in both genomic and nongenomic signaling pathways, is activated by epidermal growth factor receptor and plays a prominent role in resistance to tamoxifen. These recent advances suggest new targeted therapeutic approaches that may lead to either reversion or prevention of endocrine resistance in breast tumors.","https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article-pdf/12/3/1001s/1965811/1001s.pdf",""

Computational analyses using a CFD code is a very useful technique that helps the engineer to understand and solve the data center cooling problem. In this paper the state of the art of numerical modeling of data center is discussed. Representative systems are modeled using the two most prominent approaches. Variation in results with the addition of modeling details is presented. The effect of under floor parameters such as the conditioned chilled air supply flow rate, the under floor plenum depth, and the tile opening flow resistance, is discussed. Total flow rate delivered by the Computer Room Air Conditioning (CRAC) unit depends on blower and system characteristic curves, as specified by the vendor. Impact of plenum depth and tile resistance on total CRAC flow rate is discussed. Under floor blockages such as cables, pipes, and random materials, impede the flow of the cold air stream and yield unpredictable air flow patterns. Currently, models with idealized plenums are used for simulation of data centers. The effect of including blockages in CFD analyses is discussed. A novel approach that defines safe and critical paths under plenum for routing the blockages is presented.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2006-13494/4572939/51_1.pdf",""

In contrast, we posit in this paper that efforts companies made to renew and upgrade their IT may have positioned them to take advantage of new e-business applications. As Y2K approached, managers could invest opportunistically in IT, which would enable them to connect with customers and suppliers in new ways. Contrary to the alleged overspending, we find that firm value increased, on average, with Y2K spending by Fortune 1000 companies. In particular, higher firm value and subsequent earnings were associated with Y2K spending for firms in industries where IT was considered to have a transforming influence—altering traditional ways of doing business by redefining business processes and relationships. We also test whether the positive association between firm value and Y2K spending diminished with Y2K spending by industry peer firms, but we do not find support for this relative investment hypothesis.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0542",""

To answer this question, we use a survey of state legislators (SLs) in 1998 to examine the conditions under which male and female SLs seek a position in the U.S. House of Representatives. We consider three ways in which gender may influence ambition and the decision to run—indirectly, directly, and interactively—and we find evidence of all three effects. Female state legislators are less ambitious than males for a U.S. House seat, a difference that largely stems from gender disparities in child-care responsibilities. However, despite their lower ambition, female SLs are just as likely as their male counterparts to seek a congressional position. This apparent puzzle is solved by the finding that the expected benefit of office mediates the relationship between ambition and the likelihood of running. Female SLs are much more responsive to the expected benefit of office than are males, offsetting their diminished ambition level. The sense of a woman is reflected in female state legislators’ increased sensitivity to the strategic considerations surrounding a congressional candidacy. Because men and women respond differently to the intersection of ambition and opportunity, gender constitutes an important, yet often neglected, explanatory variable in the decision-to-run calculus.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/106591290605900206",""

We consider two types of teleseismic waves with the presence of the free surface: One is the recorded waves under the real transmission geometry; the other is the constructed waves under a virtual reflection geometry. The theory presented is limited to 1D plane wave acoustic media, but this approximation is reasonable for the teleseismic P-wave problem resulting from the steep emergence angle of the wavefield. Using one-way wavefield reciprocity, we show how the teleseismic reflection responses can be reconstructed from the teleseismic transmission responses. We use the inverse scattering series to remove free-surface multiples from the original transmission data and from the reconstructed reflection response. We derive an alternative algorithm for reconstructing the reflection response from the transmission data that is obtained by taking the difference between the teleseismic transmission waves before and after free-surface multiple removal. Numerical tests with 1D acoustic layered earth models demonstrate the validity of the theory we develop. Noise test shows that the algorithm can work with S/N ratio as low as 5 compared to actual data with S/N ratio from 30 to 50. Testing with elastic synthetic data indicates that the acoustic algorithm is still effective for small incidence angles of typical teleseismic wavefields.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/1.2217369",""

Risk preference is also investigated as an explanation for organizational choice. Econometric models are specified and estimated for organizational choice and for the underlying cost functions of competing organizational forms. Estimation of the cost functions permits isolation of the effects of transaction attributes to each form of organization, shedding light on the relative impacts of hazards of exchange and internal costs. Results provide support for both the transaction cost and risk preference hypotheses as determinants of organizational form. The cost functions also enable estimation of the incentive gains of outsourcing and the avoided transaction costs due to organizing activities internally.","https://onepetro.org/SPEATCE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/101936-MS/2812926/spe-101936-ms.pdf",""

Mutations of these proteins result in disregulated myocyte SR Ca release, cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death. We used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and fusion constructs utilizing the cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins (CFP and YFP, respectively) as donor-acceptor pairs to investigate interactions between TRD and CASQ2 and between CASQ2 monomers in a heterologous expression system (3T3 cells). All fusion constructs were localized to the stores of the endoplasmic reticulum. When coexpressed, CFP-TRD and YFP-CASQ2 exhibited FRET the efficiency of which depended on the Ca loading state of the intracellular Ca stores. FRET efficiency was high when the stores were depleted and low when stores were Ca loaded, thus revealing a negative dependency of TRD-CASQ2 interaction on [Ca]. Cotransfection of CFP-CASQ2 and YFP-CASQ2 resulted in FRET with an efficiency that increased at high Ca store loads and decreased at low store loads, consistent with positive dependence of CASQ2-mulimerization. Expression of two different CASQ2 mutants (R33Q and G112+5X) linked to sudden cardiac death specifically affected the ability of CASQ2 either to interact with TRD or to polymerize. These results indicate that functionally- relevant interactions exists between components of the multimolecular RyR Ca release channel complex. These interactions could provide a molecular basis for the dynamic control of SR Ca release by intra-store Ca and for defective SR Ca release caused by mutations of CASQ2 to cause CPVT.","",""

EGFR blockade alone may not be sufficient for the control of growth and invasion of human pancreas cancer because of the independent activation of Akt and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). The expression of EGFR, Akt, and NF-κB was determined in six human pancreatic cancer cell lines. Selected cells for specific expression were treated with erlotinib, genistein, gemcitabine, or the combination. Growth inhibition was evaluated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, and apoptosis was assayed by ELISA. EGFR, phosphorylated EGFR, phosphorylated Akt, and survivin expressions were determined by immunoblotting. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was used to evaluate the DNA binding activity of NF-κB. Genistein significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05) erlotinib-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in BxPC-3, CAPAN-2, and AsPC-1 cells. In the BxPC-3 cell line, significant down-regulation of EGFR, phosphorylated Akt, NF-κB activation, and survivin was observed in the cells treated with the combination compared with the erlotinib-treated cells. In the HPAC and MIAPaCa cell line, no potentiation of the effects of erlotinib by genistein on cell growth or inhibition of the EGFR/Akt/NF-κB was observed. Genistein potentiated growth inhibition and apoptosis of the gemcitabine and erlotinib combination in COLO-357 cell line. Genistein potentiates the growth inhibition and apoptosis induced by erlotinib and gemcitabine in certain pancreatic cancer cells. Akt and NF-κB inhibition represents one of the mechanisms for the potentiation of erlotinib- and gemcitabine-induced cell death by genistein.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is one of the cytokines responsible for the fatigue and cachexia associated with malignancies. We used etanercept (TNF-decoy receptor) to maintain dose-intensity of weekly docetaxel. Patients and Methods: Initially, 12 patients with advanced malignancies were randomly assigned to either docetaxel 43 mg/m Results: Twenty-nine of 36 intended docetaxel doses during the first cycle were delivered in cohort A, and 35 of 36 doses were delivered in cohort B (P = .055). Three cohort B patients received additional cycles in the absence of disease progression or severe toxicity, whereas no patients from cohort A received additional cycles. Escalation to docetaxel 52 mg/m Conclusion: The addition of etanercept is safe and had no impact on docetaxel concentrations. The significant improvement in tolerability and the trend toward preservation of dose-intensity suggests further exploration of TNF blockade as an adjunct to cancer therapies.","https://ascopubs.org/doi/pdfdirect/10.1200/JCO.2005.04.2838",""

In the appraisal regime, the buyer inspects the units supplied and either charges a penalty for defective units identified during inspection or pays the unit price for good units. In the certification regime, the supplier obtains vendor certification and the buyer pays the unit price for all units supplied. The inspection technology and the certification process provide noisy information on the supplier's quality effort. In the appraisal regime, the buyer implements the supplier's high-quality and low-inspection. The supplier's expected profit is greater than his reservation profit because of an additional agency cost: The buyer has to prevent the supplier from performing unwanted/preemptive inspection (which gives rise to indirect costs from delay, etc.). This additional agency cost arises precisely when the effectiveness of inspection is high. This provides a moral-hazard-based rationale for the increasing use of certification (such as ISO 9000) in spite of (in fact, because of) the increasing effectiveness of inspection. The potential for additional agency cost incurred by the buyer in the appraisal regime highlights an indirect cost associated with inspection.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0557",""

Aged β-pol+/− mice express 50% less β-pol transcripts and protein (P &lt; 0.05) than aged β-pol+/+ mice, showing maintenance of the heterozygous state over the life span of the mouse. This reduction in β-pol expression was not associated with an increase in mutation rate but was associated with a 100% increase in the onset of hypoploidy. Aged β-pol+/− mice exhibited a 6.7-fold increase in developing lymphoma (P &lt; 0.01). Accordingly, 38% of β-pol+/− mice exhibited lymphoid hyperplasia, whereas none of the β-pol+/+ exhibited this phenotype. β-pol+/− mice were also more likely to develop adenocarcinoma (2.7-fold increase; P &lt; 0.05) and more likely to develop multiple tumors, as 20% of the β-pol+/− animals died bearing multiple tumors compared with only 5% of the β-pol+/+ animals (P &lt; 0.05).

A maximum likelihood estimation analysis showed a modest but significant (P &lt; 0.05) acceleration of the age-dependent mortality rate in β-pol+/− mice.

Thus, one might expect that information technology and accounting systems would be a major component of accounting research. This study seeks to answer the questions: To what extent does the accounting literature include technology and systems research, and is technology and systems research adequately addressed in the accounting literature? To answer these questions, this study examines the proportion of technology and systems articles in seven top-ranked accounting journals, four academic and three professional. Journals examined include: The Accounting Review, Journal of Accounting Research, Journal of Accounting and Economics, Contemporary Accounting Research, Journal of Accountancy, CPA Journal, and Strategic Finance (formerly Management Accounting). The findings indicate that while there has been a dramatic increase in the proportion of systems articles published in the professional journals, there were very, very few technology and systems articles published in the academic journals. This might suggest a lack of appropriate attention by academic accounting journals to this important area. Consequently, accounting information systems (AIS) professors who are doing research in systems have a disadvantage in publishing research in top-ranked academic journals. This may result in adverse career consequences for AIS professors if they are expected to publish in these particular academic journals. Further, lack of systems research published in academic journals is detrimental to the perceived and actual relevance of these journals, as technology and systems issues are vitally important to the accounting profession.","https://publications.aaahq.org/jeta/article-pdf/3/1/117/71182/jeta_2006_3_1_117.pdf",""

The experiments are conducted in the 13-m-diameter rotating-flow facility in Grenoble, France. Two pairs of case studies, one at a large forcing velocity (designated as FAST) for which the boundary layers are fully turbulent during part of the flow cycle and one at relatively smaller forcing (SLOW) for which transitional boundary layers are operative at the higher speeds of the background flow, are conducted. Smooth and artificially roughened boundaries are considered, respectively, for each of these pairs. Phase-averaged and time-mean velocity, vertical vorticity, and horizontal divergence fields are found to be qualitatively similar to those of previous laminar experiments. The similarities in the time-mean fields are that (i) within the canyon they are dominated by cyclonic vorticity with maxima centered near the shelf break; (ii) within and in the vicinity of the canyon the general circulation pattern includes a net transport into the canyon through its mouth, a net upwelling in the canyon interior, a transport away from the canyon over the shelf break along both sides of the canyon, and, by inference, a return flow to the deep ocean; and (iii) the interior time-mean flow is characterized by a well-defined coastal current whose axis follows the shelf in the vicinity of the shelf break, with the coast on the right. It is found that the measurements of the characteristic speed of the residual or time-mean flow within the canyon for the transitional and fully turbulent experiments do not follow the scaling law derived earlier for laminar experiments. An alternative scaling analysis for large-Reynolds-number flows is thus derived. Although sufficient numbers of experiments are not available to test the hypothesis fully, the measurements available for the fully turbulent flows are consistent with the theory advanced.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jpo/article-pdf/36/5/813/4480041/jpo2866_1.pdf",""

Hypothesis: Female professional basketball players are injured at a higher rate than are men. Study Design: Cohort study (prevalence); Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Women's National Basketball Association and National Basketball Association injury data were retrospectively reviewed for 6 full seasons. The frequency of all injuries and the rate of game-related injuries were calculated. Results: Complete player profiles were obtained on 702 National Basketball Association athletes and 443 Women's National Basketball Association athletes who competed in their respective leagues during the data collection period. Total game exposures totaled 70 420 (National Basketball Association) and 22 980 (Women's National Basketball Association). Women's National Basketball Association athletes had a higher overall game-related injury rate (24.9 per 1000 athlete exposures; 95% confidence interval, 22.9-26.9; P < .05) when compared with National Basketball Association athletes (19.3 per 1000 athlete exposures; 95% confidence interval, 18.3-20.4) and sustained a higher rate of lower extremity injuries (14.6 per 1000 athlete exposures; 95% confidence interval, 13.1-16.2; P < .05) than seen in the National Basketball Association (11.6 per 1000 athlete exposures; 95% confidence interval, 10.8-12.4). The lower extremity was the most commonly injured body area (65%), and lateral ankle sprain (13.7%) was the most common diagnosis in both leagues.

We derive the absorbing boundary conditions, analyze their properties, and develop a stable explicit finite-difference scheme to solve the downward-continuation problem modified by these boundary conditions.

Therefore, soil temperature and moisture for snow-covered and snow-free areas can be very different. In computing these soil state variables, many land surface schemes in climate models do not explicitly distinguish between snow-covered and snow-free areas. Even if they do, some schemes average these state variables to calculate grid-mean energy fluxes and these averaged state variables are then used at the beginning of the next time step. This latter approach introduces a numerical error in that heat is redistributed from snow-free areas to snow-covered areas, resulting in a more rapid snowmelt. This study focuses on the latter approach and examines the sensitivity of soil moisture and streamflow to the treatment of the soil state variables in the presence of snow cover by using WATCLASS, a land surface scheme linked with a hydrologic model. The model was tested for the 1993 snowmelt period on the Upper Grand River in Southern Ontario, Canada. The results show that a more realistic simulation of streamflow can be obtained by keeping track of the soil states in snow-covered and snow-free areas.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jhm/article-pdf/7/2/298/4157251/jhm489_1.pdf",""

However, the mechanisms of host-range change involved in most of these viral emergences, particularly the genetic mechanisms of adaptation to new hosts, remain poorly understood. We studied the emergence of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), an alphavirus pathogen of people and equines that has had severe health and economic effects in the Americas since the early 20th century. Between epidemics, VEE disappears for periods up to decades, and the viral source of outbreaks has remained enigmatic. Combined with phylogenetic analyses to predict mutations associated with a 1992–1993 epidemic, we used reverse genetic studies to identify an envelope glycoprotein gene mutation that mediated emergence. This mutation allowed an enzootic, equine-avirulent VEEV strain, which circulates among rodents in nearby forests to adapt for equine amplification. RNA viruses including alphaviruses exhibit high mutation frequencies. Therefore, ecological and epidemiological factors probably constrain the frequency of VEE epidemics more than the generation, via mutation, of amplification-competent (high equine viremia) virus strains. These results underscore the ability of RNA viruses to alter their host range, virulence, and epidemic potential via minor genetic changes. VEE also demonstrates the unpredictable risks to human health of anthropogenic changes such as the introduction of equines and humans into habitats that harbor zoonotic RNA viruses.","https://pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.0509961103",""

In this article, the authors examine two questions: Will a dominant design emerge in a new product category? and If it does, how long will it be before a dominant design emerges? Thus, the authors simultaneously model the probability of emergence of a dominant design and the time of that emergence, conditional on its emergence. The model incorporates the effects of several product-market characteristics on the probability and time of dominant design emergence, including appropriability of the rents associated with the product, network effects, size of the product's value net, the standards-setting process, radicalness of innovation, and research-and-development intensity. The authors use data for 63 office products and consumer durables to estimate a split-population hazard model for the probability and time of emergence of the dominant design. They find that a dominant design is more likely to emerge with weak appropriability, weak network effects, low product radicalness, and high research-and-development intensity. Dominant designs that emerge are likely to emerge sooner in product categories in which there is weak appropriability, there are a large number of firms in the value net, the standards are set by a de facto process, and there is low product radicalness The proposed model can be used to predict both the probability and the time of the emergence of a dominant design in a new product category.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1509/jmkg.70.2.001",""

This study evaluated adding consolidation paclitaxel after chemoradiotherapy for a similar patient cohort. Patients and Methods: Patients with histologically/cytologically determined stage III NSCLC were eligible based on performance status (PS) 2 and either low albumin or weight loss more than 10%, poor pulmonary function, or comorbidities precluding cisplatin use. Treatment was carboplatin 200 mg/m Results: Characteristics of 87 eligible patients were age 51 to 82 years; 57% PS 0 to 1, 43% PS 2; and 51% stage IIIA, 49% stage IIIB. Toxicities of concurrent chemoradiotherapy included grade 3 esophagitis (7%) and grade 3/4 neutropenia (43%). Fifty-four assessable patients received paclitaxel consolidation. Four treatment-related deaths occurred during chemoradiotherapy and four occurred during consolidation. Overall response rate was 53%. Median progression free- and overall survival were 6.1 and 10.2 months, respectively. One- and 2-year survival rates were 43% and 25%. Conclusion: Compared with a previous SWOG trial in a similar patient population, the addition of consolidation paclitaxel after chemoradiotherapy resulted in increased toxicity without a survival advantage. More PS 2 patients (43% v 18%) enrolled onto S9712, which may explain increased toxicity and lack of benefit. The optimal chemoradiotherapy approach for poor-risk patients remains to be defined.","https://ascopubs.org/doi/pdfdirect/10.1200/JCO.2006.07.0268",""

Magnetic annealing increases (001) out-of-plane texture of the FePt hard phase by 50% and introduces magnetic anisotropy in the annealed samples. It is suggested that pretextured Fe and Pt nanocrystals provide favorable nucleation sites for magnetic-field-induced nucleation and growth of textured FePt grains.

Of particular note, one of these, a construction of the wavefield at any depth (including the transmitted wavefield), order-by-order in the measured reflected wavefield, has an unusual set of capabilities (e.g., it does not involve an assumption regarding the minimum-phase nature of the data and is accomplished with processing in the simple reference medium only) and requirements (e.g., a suite of frequencies from surface data are required to compute a single frequency of the wavefield at depth when the subsurface is unknown). An alternative reflection-to-transmission data mapping (which does not require a knowledge of the wavelet, and in which the component of the unknown medium that is linear in the reflection data is used as a proxy for the component of the unknown medium that is linear in the transmission data) is also derivable from the inverse scattering series framework.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/1.2217728",""

In search of simpler models based entirely on remote‐sensing data, we examined direct relationships between the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and gross primary productivity (GPP) measured at nine eddy covariance flux tower sites across North America. When data from the winter period of inactive photosynthesis were excluded, the overall relationship between EVI and tower GPP was better than that between MOD17 GPP and tower GPP. However, the EVI/GPP relationships vary between sites. Correlations between EVI and GPP were generally greater for deciduous than for evergreen sites. However, this correlation declined substantially only for sites with the smallest seasonal variation in EVI, suggesting that this relationship can be used for all but the most evergreen sites. Within sites dominated by either evergreen or deciduous species, seasonal variation in EVI was best explained by the severity of summer drought. Our results demonstrate that EVI alone can provide estimates of GPP that are as good as, if not better than, current versions of the MOD17 algorithm for many sites during the active period of photosynthesis. Preliminary data suggest that inclusion of other remote‐sensing products in addition to EVI, such as the MODIS land surface temperature (LST), may result in more robust models of carbon balance based entirely on remote‐sensing data.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2006JG000162",""

The AVO curves for TE and TM modes differ significantly. In some cases, constraining the interpretation using both TE and TM data is critical.

Specifically, the glacial/interglacial transitions took place when the 65°N July insolation experienced the most rapid changes; interglacials start with a maximum positive RSIC and end with a maximum negative RISC. The RSIC curve thus provides a new astronomically tuned method for dating interglacials. The 65°N July RISC curves average a 4.7 ky lead compared to ice sheet changes as indicated by Bassinot et al.

The study provides field test age- and grade-based INMIS values to aid clinicians in making normative judgments about microstructural aspects of pupils’ narrative performance. Method: Narrative samples using a single-picture elicitation context were collected from 250 children age 5–12 years and then transcribed and segmented into T-units. A T-unit consists of a single main clause and any dependent constituents. The narrative transcripts were then coded and analyzed to document a comprehensive set of microstructural indices. Results: Factor analysis indicated that narrative microstructure consisted of 2 moderately related factors. The Productivity factor primarily comprised measures of word output, lexical diversity, and T-unit output. The Complexity factor comprised measures of syntactic organization, with mean length of T-units in words and proportion of complex T-units loading most strongly. Principal components analysis was used to provide a linear combination of 8 variables to approximate the 2 factors. Formulas for calculating a student’s performance on the 2 factors using 8 narrative measures are provided. Conclusions: This study provided a method for professionals to calculate INMIS scores for narrative Productivity and Complexity for comparison against field test data for age (5- to 12-year-old) or grade (kindergarten to Grade 6) groupings. INMIS scores complement other tools in evaluating a child’s narrative performance specifically and language abilities more generally.","http://pubs.asha.org/doi/pdf/10.1044/1058-0360%282006/017%29",""

Here, we report on such results for 14 cotton lines (CS-B) with specific chromosomes or chromosome arms from G. barbadense L. substituted into G. hirsutum and chromosome-specific F2 families. Boll size, lint percentage, micronaire, 2.5% span length, elongation, strength, and yield were measured by replicated field experiments in five diverse environments and analyzed under an additive–dominance (AD) genetic model with genotype and environment interaction. Additive effects were significant for all traits and dominance effects were significant for all traits except 2.5% span length. CS-B25 had additive effects increasing fiber strength and fiber length and decreasing micronaire. CS-B16 and CS-B18 had additive effects related to reduced yields. The results point toward specific chromosomes of G. barbadense 3-79 as the probable locations of the genes that significantly affect quantitative traits of importance. Our results provided a scope to analyze individual chromosomes of the genome in homozygous and heterozygous conditions and thus detected novel effects of alleles controlling important QTL.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/172/3/1927/42065701/genetics1927.pdf",""

Objective:: To identify factors that might affect the outcome of adult atomoxetine ingestions reported to poison control centers. Methods:: Using adult ingestions of atomoxetine alone reported to Texas poison control centers during 2003–2005, the proportion of cases involving serious outcomes was determined for selected variables and evaluated for statistical significance by calculating the rate ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results:: Of 64 cases identified, 9 (14%) involved serious outcomes. No serious outcomes were reported with a maximum dose of 100 mg or less. Serious outcomes were significantly more likely to occur with a maximum dose of more than 2 capsules (RR 8.25; 95% CI 1.48 to 83.58), where the circumstances of the exposures involved self-harm or malicious intent (RR 6.02; 95% CI 1.30 to 30.35) or when the patient was already at or en route to a healthcare facility when the poison control center was contacted (RR 18.75; 95% CI 2.10 to 886.83) or was referred to a healthcare facility by the poison control center (RR 22.50; 95% CI 1.81 to 1181.19).

In many decision contexts the decision maker is presented with a list of attributes without an opportunity to consider her fundamental objectives. In this paper we explore an approach where a decision maker is given prespecified attributes and then identifies her objectives. She assesses multiattribute models to predict performance levels on each objective and a preference model over these objectives. We use simulation to explore what happens when a decision maker applies this two-step approach to model the relationships between a given set of attributes and her objectives instead of attempting to directly estimate the attribute weights in a choice problem. These simulation results suggest that the explicit consideration of objectives results in less error in expressions of preference than the direct weighting of attributes unless the number of attributes and objectives in the decision context is small.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/deca.1060.0069",""

The purpose of this study is to determine if the stress hormone norepi can influence the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, and VEGF in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) tumors by using three NPC tumor cell lines. The NPC cell lines HONE-1, HNE-1, and CNE-1 were treated with norepi. The effects of norepi on MMP-2, MMP-9, and VEGF synthesis were measured by ELISA; functional MMP activity was measured by the invasive potential of the cells using a membrane invasion culture system whereas functional activity of VEGF was analyzed using a human umbilical vein endothelial cell tube formation assay. Norepi treatment increased MMP-2, MMP-9, and VEGF levels in culture supernatants of HONE-1 cells, which could be inhibited by the β-blocker propranolol. Norepi induced the invasiveness of all NPC cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, which was blocked by CMT-3, an MMP inhibitor, and propranolol. Norepi stimulated the release of functional angiogenic VEGF by HONE-1 cells as well. Finally, HONE-1 cells were shown to express β-adrenergic receptors as did seven of seven NPC biopsies examined. The data suggest that catecholamine hormones produced by the sympathetic-adrenal medullary axis may affect NPC tumor progression, in part, through modulation of key angiogenic cytokines.

The trajectories are initiated at the transition state with fixed energy in reaction-coordinate translation Et‡. The QCT simulations have zero-point energy (ZPE) in the vibrational modes orthogonal to the reaction coordinate, while there is no ZPE for the STs. A semiquantitative agreement is obtained between the ST and QCT average percent product energy partitionings. The ST approach is used to study mass effects for product energy partitioning in HX(X=ForCl) elimination from halogenated alkanes by using the MP2∕6-31G* PES for C2H5F dissociation and varying the masses of the C, H, and F atoms. There is, at most, only a small mass effect for partitioning of energy to HX vibration and rotation. In contrast, there are substantial mass effects for partitioning to relative translation and the polyatomic product’s vibration and rotation. If the center of mass of the polyatomic product is located away from the C atom from which HX recoils, the polyatomic has substantial rotation energy. Polyatomic products, with heavy atoms such as Cl atoms replacing the H atoms, receive substantial vibration energy that is primarily transferred to the wag-bend motions.

Since the magnetization decreases as the Fe content is decreased and the uniaxial anisotropy energy keeps at almost constant, the uniaxial anisotropic field HK is increased. At the same time, the pinning field Hp(0) changes little since the lattice constant of Fe-Cr alloy film does not change much with the composition. Consequently, the HK can be much larger than Hp(0) for low Fe concentrations and becomes comparable with increasing Fe concentration. As a result, the magnetization reversal mechanism evolves from a mode based on the pinning and motion of domain wall to another mode based on modified Kondorsky model as the Fe content is increased.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.2357637/14971919/073909_1_online.pdf",""

Offshore studies demonstrate accelerated subduction erosion starting at the Miocene‐Pliocene boundary, as the result of subduction of thickened Galapagos related crust, as presently represented by the Cocos Ridge. The subduction of the Cocos Ridge also caused uplift and exposure of the outer forearc on the Osa Peninsula, which offers a window to explore the tectonic evolution of the area. The rocks outcropping on Osa Peninsula are a middle Eocene–middle Miocene mélange dominated by basalt, chert, and limestone resulting from accretion of seamounts. The accretion‐dominated period of the MAT evolution ended at the Miocene‐Pliocene boundary, when thickened crust, a paleo‐Cocos Ridge, produced at the Galapagos hot spot arrived at the trench. The thick crust caused uplift and severe tectonic erosion of the accretionary edifice allowing exhumation of the Osa Mélange. The change from accretion to erosion caused the outer forearc to be offset along subvertical faults that define small (kilometer to tens of kilometers size) blocks that are going through differential vertical movements in response to the morphology of the subducting ridge. Subduction accretion and erosion are two processes that can alternate in time and space or coexist along the same margin, so that mass removal can develop on a previously growing margin and completely remove an accretionary prism.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2005TC001855",""

Here we show that estrogen promotes an association between extranuclear estrogen receptor α (ER) and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family member ERBB4. Ectopically expressed as well as endogenous ERBB4 interacts with and potentiates ER transactivation, indicating that the ERBB4/ER interaction is functional. Estrogen induces nuclear translocation of the proteolytic processed ERBB4 intracellular domain (4ICD) and nuclear translocation of 4ICD requires functional ligand-bound ER. The nuclear ER/4ICD complex is selectively recruited to estrogen-inducible gene promoters such as progesterone receptor (PgR) and stromal cell–derived factor 1 (SDF-1) but not to trefoil factor 1 precursor (pS2). Consistent with 4ICD-selective promoter binding, suppression of ERBB4 expression by interfering RNA shows that 4ICD coactivates ER transcription at the PgR and SDF-1 but not the pS2 promoter. Significantly, ERBB4 itself is an estrogen-inducible gene and the ERBB4 promoter harbors a consensus estrogen response element (ERE) half-site with overlapping activator protein-1 elements that bind ER and 4ICD in response to estrogen. Using a cell proliferation assay and a small interfering RNA approach, we show that ERBB4 expression is required for the growth-promoting action of estrogen in the T47D breast cancer cell line. Our results indicate that ERBB4 is a unique coregulator of ER, directly coupling extranuclear and nuclear estrogen actions in breast cancer. We propose that the contribution of an autocrine ERBB4/ER signaling pathway to tumor growth and therapeutic response should be considered when managing patients with ER-positive breast cancer.

It is shown that a primary plasma flow (locally sub-Alfvénic) is accelerated while interacting with ambient arcade-like closed field structures. The time scale for creating reasonably fast flows (≳100km∕s) is dictated by the initial ion skin depth, while the amplification of the flow depends on local plasma β. It is shown that distances over which the flows become “fast” are ∼0.01R0 from the interaction surface (R0 being a characteristic length of the system); later, the fast flow localizes (with dimensions ≲0.05R0) in the upper central region of the original arcade. For fixed initial temperature, the final speed (≳500km∕s) of the accelerated flow and the modification of the field structure are independent of the time duration (lifetime) of the initial flow.

The system appears to be a good mimic of small natural streams based on system flow rates, establishment of natural substrates and cover, stream chemistry relative to that of a natural creek, and fish behaviors. At least 39 fish species have been used successfully in 1–14‐month experiments in these systems and approximately half have reproduced.

Developing a new cadre of clinical instructors poses a substantial faculty development challenge: what instructional techniques should be integrated into routine educational practice by the dental faculty of the future, and what aspects of the clinical learning environment should be addressed to improve the overall quality of the experience for patients, students, and the new cohort of instructors? To gain insight that might guide faculty development for new clinical instructors and enhance understanding of the learning environment in dental school clinics, this study addressed the following question: what are dental students’ perceptions of their learning experiences in the clinical setting? The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the clinical instruction from the perspectives of the actual “consumer” of dental education: the student. This consumers’ perspective was provided by 655 junior, senior, and graduate dental students at twenty‐one North American dental schools who completed the Clinical Education Instructional Quality Questionnaire (ClinEd IQ) in 2003–04. The ClinED IQ examines four components of students’ clinical experiences: 1) clinical learning opportunities, 2) involvement in specific learning activities, 3) interaction with clinical instructors, and 4) personal perceptions about clinical education. With the exception of inconsistent feedback and instruction and lack of continuous contact with the same instructors, juniors, seniors, and graduate students rated their interaction with clinical instructors favorably (mean=4.76 on a 6.00 scale), but provided lower ratings for clinical learning opportunities (mean=4.26 on a 6.00 scale) due to concerns about the efficiency of the dental clinic environment and lack of opportunity to treat patients in a variety of clinical settings. Analysis of more than 1,000 written comments provided by these students indicated four areas of concern: 1) inconsistent and sometimes insensitive (patronizing, rude) feedback from faculty; 2) excessive amounts of noneducational “legwork” such as billing, patient scheduling, phone calling, completing paperwork, and performing other clinic operations tasks; 3) limited access to faculty because of insufficient numbers of instructors on the clinic floor or difficulty locating faculty when they were needed for coaching, work evaluation, and chart signatures; and 4) concerns about the strategies employed to meet procedural requirements that some students saw as ethically questionable. Junior, senior, and graduate dental students at twenty‐one North American dental schools perceived that the strongest aspect of their clinical education was their relationship with the faculty, but also reported that the dental school clinic was often an inefficient learning environment that hindered their opportunity to develop clinical competency. Students also sensed that faculty shortages, a growing crisis for dental education, hindered their progress in the clinic and made learning less efficient.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fj.0022-0337.2006.70.4.tb04091.x",""

We emphasize the high-frequency variants on which positive selection and negative (background) selection exhibit different effects. We propose a new estimator of θ (the product of effective population size and neutral mutation rate), θL, which is sensitive to the changes in high-frequency variants. The new θL allows us to revise Fay and Wu's H-test by normalization. To complement the existing statistics (the H-test and Tajima's D-test), we propose a new test, E, which relies on the difference between θL and Watterson's θW. We show that this test is most powerful in detecting the recovery phase after the loss of genetic diversity, which includes the postselective sweep phase. The sensitivities of these tests to (or robustness against) background selection and demographic changes are also considered. Overall, D and H in combination can be most effective in detecting positive selection while being insensitive to other perturbations. We thus propose a joint test, referred to as the DH test. Simulations indicate that DH is indeed sensitive primarily to directional selection and no other driving forces.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/174/3/1431/42086385/genetics1431.pdf",""

We show that γ-ray photons for two bursts, 050126 and 050219A, for which we have carried out detailed analysis were produced as a result of the synchrotron self-Compton process in the material ejected in the explosion when it was heated to a mildly relativistic temperature at a distance from the centre of explosion of order the deceleration radius. Both of these bursts exhibit rapidly declining early X-ray afterglow light curves; this emission is from the same source that produced the γ-ray burst. The technique that we exploit to determine this is very general and makes no assumption about any particular model for γ-ray generation except that the basic radiation mechanism is some combination of synchrotron and inverse Compton processes in a relativistic outflow. For GRB 050219A we can rule out the possibility that energy from the explosion is carried outward by magnetic fields, and that the dissipation of this field produced the γ-ray burst.","https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/article-pdf/367/1/L52/54689887/mnrasl_367_1_l52.pdf",""

The Al(OH)3 was decomposed into Al2O3 and H2O according to a partial Bayer process in a modified molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) effusion cell, which was equipped with homemade baffles placed at its outlet. These homemade, simple-to-construct tantalum baffles allow for the selective outfluxing of gaseous species, from those that are solid based. A UTI™ 100C-model mass spectrometer was used to monitor the species present at the sapphire surface during annealing. Any aluminum-based solid species from the Al(OH)3 were not observed in the mass spectrum, although the H2O-based species were. The sapphire substrates were annealed in a Varian Gen II™ MBE system, with H2O beam equivalent pressures (BEPs) of 5×10−6 and 2×10−5Torr, as well as with no H2O flux at all.

Background: Although image-guided interventions used in MIS provide benefits for patients, they pose drawbacks for surgeons, including degraded depth perception and reduced field of view (FOV). It is important to identify design factors that affect performance. Method: In two navigation experiments, observers fed a borescope through an object until it reached a target. Task completion time and object shape judgments were measured. In a motion perception experiment, observers reported the direction of a line that moved behind an aperture. A motion illusion associated with reduced FOV was measured. Results: Navigation through an object was faster when a preview of the object's exterior was provided. Judgments about the object's shape were more accurate with a preview (compared with none) and with active viewing (compared with passive viewing). The motion illusion decreased with a rectangular or rotating octagonal viewing aperture (compared with circular). Conclusions: Navigation performance may be enhanced when surgeons develop a mental model of the surgical environment, when surgeons (rather than assistants) control the camera, and when the shape of the image is designed to reduce visual illusions. Application: Unintentional contact between surgical tools and healthy tissues may be reduced during MIS when (a) visual aids permit surgeons to maintain a mental model of the surgical environment, (b) images are bound by noncircular apertures, and (c) surgeons manually control the camera.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1518/001872006776412162",""

EGFR-related protein (ERRP), a recently identified pan-erbB inhibitor, has been shown to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and tumor growth in a xenograft model. However, the precise molecular mechanism(s) by which ERRP exerts its antitumor activity remains unclear. The current investigation was undertaken to delineate the tumor growth inhibitory mechanism(s) of ERRP in pancreatic cancer cells. Using multiple molecular assays, such as 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, apoptosis, gene transfection, real-time reverse transcription-PCR, Western blotting, invasion, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay for measuring DNA-binding activity of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), we found that ERRP caused marked inhibition of pancreatic cancer cell growth. This was accompanied by increased apoptosis and concomitant attenuation of Notch-1 and NF-κB and down-regulation of NF-κB downstream genes, such as matrix metalloproteinase-9 and vascular endothelial growth factor, resulting in the inhibition of pancreatic cancer cell invasion through the Matrigel. We also found that down-regulation of Notch-1 by small interfering RNA before ERRP treatment resulted in enhanced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis. Our data suggest that the ERRP-mediated inactivation of EGFR, Notch-1, NF-κB, and its downstream target genes contributed to the inhibition of cell growth and invasion. We conclude that ERRP could be an effective agent for inhibiting tumor growth and invasion for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

There are no reports in the literature describing students’ perceptions of mandatory laptop programs, which are now being implemented by at least 25 percent of North American dental schools. In schools that have implemented laptop programs, students are required either to enroll with their own laptops that meet specifications or to purchase a laptop from the school at matriculation. In some schools, students are also required to purchase curriculum support software that is bundled with the laptop. This study was conducted to determine students’ opinions at U.S. dental schools with mandatory laptop programs about these aspects of this information technology initiative: frequency of use, perceived necessity of use, note‐typing during lectures, effectiveness of training, influence on study habits, benefits, implementation problems, added value in relation to added tuition costs, impact on quality of dental education, overall rating of the laptop experience, and impact of the laptop on use of other electronic curriculum resources. Responses of students at schools that purchased packaged curriculum support software from a commercial vendor were compared with students’ responses at schools where faculty provided their own educational software. Responses were also compared among freshmen, sophomores, and upperclassmen in a cross‐sectional sample. In 2004, approximately 800 dental students at fourteen dental schools responded to eleven questions that requested their impressions and evaluation of mandatory laptop programs and associated educational software. These questions comprised one section of the IREC Students’ Questionnaire (IREC=Institutional Readiness for Electronic Curriculum) that assessed students’ perceptions of various aspects of information technology at their schools. The majority of students (63 percent) reported that the laptop and associated software were not essential for successful performance in their courses primarily because few instructors had modified their courses to take advantage of laptop capacities. Slightly more than half of the students reported their training was good or excellent, but felt that classroom‐based “one size fits all” training was not effective. Less than 15 percent of the students reported that they had made substantial changes in their study habits as a consequence of the laptop program. The benefits perceived by students were primarily related to enhanced email communication with classmates and instructors and convenient access to the Internet and teachers’ PowerPoint presentations. Implementation barriers included the inconvenience of carrying laptops to classes, lack of incentive to use the laptop and software because instructors did not require it, and poor quality software. Only 32 percent of students agreed that the value of the laptop and associated software was equal to the added tuition costs. Less than half of the students perceived that the laptop and software had improved the quality of their education, but more than 70 percent rated their overall experiences with laptops as “okay,” “good,” or “excellent.” Freshmen expressed significantly more positive attitudes about the frequency of use, cost‐effectiveness, educational value, and overall quality of laptops and bundled software than did upperclassmen. A significantly higher percentage of students at schools affiliated with a software vendor reported that laptops were essential in courses than students at schools with locally produced software, but students at vendor‐supplied schools rated the cost‐effectiveness significantly lower. Overall, students’ assessment of mandatory laptop programs was mixed although freshmen provided significantly more positive responses than did upperclassmen. Incorporation of the e‐curriculum into dental schools appears to be following a similar pattern as problem‐based learning (PBL) in the 1980s and 1990s. Recommendations for enhancing future e‐curricula are proposed based on lessons learned from both information technology and PBL implementation.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fj.0022-0337.2006.70.5.tb04103.x",""

Background: Identifying variables that predict skilled performance in a complex task aids in understanding the nature of skill and also aids in the selection of operators to perform that task. SA is thought to be an important predictor of performance. SA is often thought to be based on underlying cognitive mechanisms. Method: Three performance measures taken from the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) Air Traffic Scenarios Test, the low-fidelity simulation component of the FAA's controller selection battery, were used as criterion variables in a hierarchical regression. After predicting performance based on a battery of cognitive (e.g., intelligence, working memory, spatial memory) and noncognitive tests (e.g., cognitive style, personality, demographics), we added measures of SA. Results: SA did provide increases in prediction, but only when measured with the Situation Present Assessment Method, an on-line query method. When the same questions were asked off line, SA did not enter the model in two cases and improved prediction by only 2% in the third. Conclusion: Thus, some measures of SA do show incremental validity, even against a backdrop of a large number of cognitive variables. Application: On-line measures of SA can be a worthwhile addition to standard batteries of tests used to predict performance in cognitively oriented industrial tasks.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1518/001872006779166316",""

The method is designed to detect hydrocarbon deposits at depths of a few kilometers and to map their boundaries. The technique is based on imaging the induced-polarization (IP) parameters of the geologic formation. We use the fact that, because of the imaginary part of the electric conductivity, polarized media support wave propagation processes whose nature is similar to displacement currents induced by the dielectric permittivity. However, unlike displacement currents, these processes reveal themselves at much lower frequencies and, therefore, at greater depths. It is established that the ratio of the second and the first differences of the electric potential does not decay after the current turn-off in polarized media, whereas it decays quickly if the IP effect is absent. Thus, the IP response can be observed directly and separated from the electromagnetic (EM) response. We use a vertical focusing of the electric current to decrease the effect of laterally adjacent formations to apply a 1D layered model in a 3D environment. This method obtained promising results in several regions of Russia.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/1.2217367",""

Method: rCBF was measured in 33 normal participants between the ages of 7 and 19 years using single photon emission computed tomography. Participants' ages were regressed on rCBF values (normalized to whole-brain CBF) in 2 ways: (a) within anatomically defined, language-related regions of interest (ROIs) including Wernicke’s area, Broca’s area, angular gyrus, planum temporale, and Heschl’s gyrus and (b) within clusters of voxels found to be significantly related to age in voxel-wise analyses. Results: rCBF in all anatomically defined ROIs except Heschl’s gyrus declined as a function of age. Additionally, voxel-wise analyses revealed clusters where rCBF declined with age in left inferior parietal, left superior temporal, and right middle temporal regions—areas often implicated in higher order language functions. Conclusions: These data suggest that ongoing maturation (e.g., dendritic pruning) in higher order cognitive areas (e.g., angular gyrus) continues into adolescence, as reflected by declining rCBF, while the primary auditory area (Heschl’s gyrus) has become a stable neuronal population by age 7 years.","http://pubs.asha.org/doi/pdf/10.1044/1092-4388%282006/061%29",""

Cygb expression was primarily restricted to the central nervous system and neural crest derivatives during the latter stages of development. In the adult mouse, Cygb is expressed in distinct regions of the brain as compared with neuroglobin (Ngb), another globin protein, and these regions are responsive to oxidative stress (i.e., hippo-campus, thalamus, and hypothalamus). In contrast to Ngb, Cygb expression in the brain is induced in response to chronic hypoxia (10% oxygen).

The heat treatments lead to agglomeration and sintering of the nanoparticles. To prevent the particles from sintering, salts as the separating media (matrix) have been used for annealing the nanoparticles in our experiments. The fcc nanoparticles produced by chemical synthesis were mixed with NaCl powders. The mixture was then annealed in forming gas (93%H2+7%Ar) in different conditions to complete the fcc to fct phase transition. After the annealing, the salt was washed out by water and monodisperse fct FePt nanoparticles were obtained. Detailed studies on the effect of the NaCl-to-FePt weight ratios (from 1:1 to 400:1) have been performed. It was found that a suitable NaCl-to-FePt ratio is the key to obtain monodisperse fct FePt nanoparticles. A higher NaCl-to-FePt ratio is needed for larger particles when the annealing conditions are the same. Increased annealing temperature and time should be accompanied by a higher NaCl-to-FePt ratio.

Muscle from type 2 diabetic subjects was characterized by a 60% decrease in IκBβ protein abundance, an indicator of increased activation of the IκB/NFκB pathway. IκBβ abundance directly correlated with insulin-mediated glucose disposal (Rd) during a hyperinsulinemic (40 mU · m−2 · min−1)-euglycemic clamp (r = 0.63, P = 0.01), indicating that increased IκB/NFκB pathway activity is associated with muscle insulin resistance. We also investigated whether reversal of this abnormality could be a mechanism by which training improves insulin sensitivity. In control subjects, 8 weeks of aerobic exercise training caused a 50% increase in both IκBα and IκBβ protein. In subjects with type 2 diabetes, training increased IκBα and IκBβ protein to levels comparable with that of control subjects, and these increments were accompanied by a 40% decrease in tumor necrosis factor α muscle content and a 37% increase in insulin-stimulated glucose disposal. In summary, subjects with type 2 diabetes have reduced IκB protein abundance in muscle, suggesting excessive activity of the IκB/NFκB pathway. Moreover, this abnormality is reversed by exercise training.","https://journals.org/diabetes/diabetes/article-pdf/55/3/760/651393/zdb00306000760.pdf",""

The so-called “drag-a-drop” method is proposed, where a droplet of fluid is held between the moving lens and the mask due to surface tension forces without the need of a fluid circulation system. Theoretical calculations and experimental measurements show that a stable droplet can be held onto a 6mm diameter lens, typical in size for laser mask writing, translating at velocities up to 600mm∕s. Experiments also show that the stability of the droplet is greatly enhanced by the addition of a hydrophobic topcoat on the surface of the mask. Receding edge instabilities with the deposition of droplets similar to those seen in 193nm immersion lithography and a new advancing edge instability with complete drop breakup were seen at sufficiently high velocities. A stability map is presented that predicts the onset of these two instabilities as a function of the dimensionless capillary number, a ratio of the viscous forces to surface tensions forces, and Weber number, a ratio of inertial forces to surface tension forces. Moving the lens and attached droplet off and on the edge of the mask during the scanning process can be done repeatedly with no fluid loss. The constancy of the index of refraction of the droplet is an important consideration for immersion lithography. The index can change due to changes in temperature and composition. Calculations and experiment with 193nm immersion indicate that maintaining a constant index of refraction in laser mask writing with the drag-a-drop system is feasible. The application of immersion lithography appears to be a viable means of increasing the resolution of laser mask writing.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-pdf/24/6/2659/14923459/2659_1_online.pdf",""

The EM lifetime of the SnAg Pb-free solders with either Cu or Ni UBM was found to be better than the eutectic SnPb (63Sn37Pb) solders but worse than high-Pb (95Pb5Sn) solders. In the test temperature range, the EM lifetimes were found to be comparable for Cu and Ni UBMs but with different activation energies: 0.64–0.72eV for Cu UBM and 1.03–1.11eV for Ni UBM. EM failure was observed only in solder bumps with electron current flow from UBM to the substrate. Failure analysis revealed that EM damage was initiated by the formation of intermetallic compounds (IMC) at the UBM∕solder interface which was found to be significantly enhanced by mass transport driven by the electron current. Under EM, the continued growth of IMC with the dissolution of the UBM and the accumulation of Kirkendall voids resulted in the formation of interfacial cracks and eventual EM failure of the solder bump. For Ni UBM, the IMC formation was dominated by the Ni3Sn4 phase while for Cu UBM, a bilayer of Cu3Sn∕Cu6Sn5 was found. Void formation at the Cu6Sn5∕solder interface was found to be important in controlling the EM lifetime of the Cu UBM solder.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.2193037/13693464/094906_1_online.pdf",""

We examined effects of diabetes on proteins comprising NF-κB canonical and noncanonical activation pathways in the renal cortex of diabetic mice. Plasma concentrations of NF-κB–regulated cytokines were increased after 1 month of hyperglycemia, but most returned to control levels or lower by 3 months, when the same cytokines were increased significantly in renal cortex. Cytosolic content of NF-κB canonical pathway proteins did not differ between experimental groups after 3 months of diabetes, while NF-κB noncanonical pathway proteins were affected, including increased phosphorylation of inhibitor of κB kinase-α and several fold increases in NF-κB–inducing kinase and RelB, which were predominantly located in tubular epithelial cells. Nuclear content of all NF-κB pathway proteins was decreased by diabetes, with the largest change in RelB and p50 (approximately twofold decrease). Despite this decrease, measurable increases in protein binding to DNA in diabetic versus control nuclear extracts were observed with electrophoretic mobility shift assay.

All studies were performed with the surgeon present. Methods: An ICAVL-accredited vascular laboratory database of upper extremity noninvasive vascular studies performed during a 12-month period was reviewed. The study group consisted of 152 end stage renal disease patients who received Doppler ultrasound and/or noninvasive physiologic testing for the purpose of assisting in planning or maintenance of hemodialysis access. The study group yielded a total of 252 exams as follows: (1) preoperative evaluation to determine site and suitability for use in AV access creation (n = 133); (2) existing AV access (AV fistula or graft) with clinical symptoms indicating malfunction and need for identifying the location and/or nature of the problem (n = 98); (3) finger arterial pressures and wave forms (with and without access compression) in patients with clinical symptoms of steal syndrome (n = 21). Results: Of the 133 preoperative evaluations, 67 (51%) resulted in creation of an AV graft and 66 (49%) in an AV fistula. AV graft was chosen over fistula because of duplex findings of inadequate (<2 mm in diameter) or deep (>7 mm below skin level) veins. In all cases, the site and arm were determined by duplex findings and were marked preoperatively by the surgeon. In 72 (73.5%) of the 98 malfunctioning AV accesses, the etiology and site were identified by duplex ultrasound. These included thrombosing/failing access (n = 18, 25%), outflow venous stenosis (n = 16, 22.2%), inflow arterial stenosis (n = 15, 20.8%), anastomotic stenosis (n = 9, 12.5%), and miscellaneous causes (n = 14, 19.5%). Again, sites were marked by the access surgeon to guide intraoperative management. Steal was confirmed to be present in 11 (52%) of 21 patients and the surgeon determined the degree of arterial banding based on intraoperative changes in digital pressures. Conclusions: Preoperative duplex scanning of upper extremity vasculature with the access surgeon present allows for accurate and precise planning in the creation of AV access. This has the potential to improve compliance with K/DOQI guidelines. Success in rescuing failing angioaccess is also enhanced by non-invasive testing in the presence of the operating surgeon.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/154431670603000305",""

If so, the tasks and measures would be appropriate for assessing pretest and posttest change within a dynamic assessment format. The second experiment evaluated the extent to which children with language impairments performed differently than typically developing controls on dynamic assessment of narrative language. Method: In the first experiment, 58 1st- and 2nd-grade children told 2 stories about wordless picture books. Stories were rated on macrostructural and microstructural aspects of language form and content, and the ratings were subjected to reliability analyses. In the second experiment, 71 children participated in dynamic assessment. There were 3 phases: a pretest phase, in which children created a story that corresponded to 1 of the wordless picture books from Experiment 1; a teaching phase, in which children attended 2 short mediation sessions that focused on storytelling ability; and a posttest phase, in which children created a story that corresponded to a second wordless picture book from Experiment 1. Analyses compared the pretest and posttest stories that were told by 2 groups of children who received mediated learning (typical and language impaired groups) and a no-treatment control group of typically developing children from Experiment 1. Results: The results of the first experiment indicated that the narrative measures applied to stories about 2 different wordless picture books had good internal consistency. In Experiment 2, typically developing children who received mediated learning demonstrated a greater amount of pretest to posttest change than children in the language impaired and control groups. Classification analysis indicated better specificity and sensitivity values for measures of response to intervention (modifiability) and posttest storytelling than for measures of pretest storytelling. Observation of modifiability was the single best indicator of language impairment. Posttest measures and modifiability together yielded no misclassifications. Conclusion: The first experiment supported the use of 2 wordless picture books as stimulus materials for collecting narratives before and after mediation within a dynamic assessment paradigm. The second experiment supported the use of dynamic assessment for accurately identifying language impairments in school-age children.","http://pubs.asha.org/doi/pdf/10.1044/1092-4388%282006/074%29",""

We prove that our load balancing mechanism is truthful (i.e., agents will be better off by reporting their true parameters) and satisfies the voluntary participation condition (i.e., truthful agents never incur a loss). We present a simulation study to show the performance of our load balancing mechanism.","https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S0129626406002435",""

Here, we profiled the cell surface of the NCI-60 by high-throughput screening of a phage-displayed random peptide library and classified the cell lines according to the binding selectivity of 26,031 recovered tripeptide motifs. By analyzing selected cell-homing peptide motifs and their NCI-60 recognition patterns, we established that some of these motifs (a) are similar to domains of human proteins known as ligands for tumor cell receptors and (b) segregate among the NCI-60 in a pattern correlating with expression profiles of the corresponding receptors. We biochemically validated some of the motifs as mimic peptides of native ligands for the epidermal growth factor receptor. Our results indicate that ligand-directed profiling of tumor cell lines can select functional peptides from combinatorial libraries based on the expression of tumor cell surface molecules, which in turn could be exploited as “druggable” receptors in specific types of cancer.

Cervices are obtained from estrus and timed pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats ( n=4-10 per group). Preterm labor is induced with Onapristone (3 mg/rat; progesterone antagonist) and the prolongation of pregnancy with progesterone (2.5 mg, twice daily). Collagen changes are measured and visualized with the picrosirius polarization method. RT-PCR is used to characterize the mRNA expression ( p<0.5), and immunohistochemistry is used to localize the protein expression for iNOS and COX-2. The organization and birefringence of the collagen during pregnancy decreased and is supported by changes in the luminosity ( p<0.001). The iNOS and COX-2 enzymes were localized in cervical smooth muscle, vascular smooth muscle, and epithelium. Under normal conditions, iNOS mRNA levels decreased as COX-2 mRNA levels increased demonstrating an inverse correlation (Spearman r = −0.497; p=0.00295). Onapristone stimulated preterm labor, increasing the iNOS and COX-2 mRNA ( p<0.05). The increase demonstrated a positive correlation (Spearman r = 0.456; p=0.03).

This work presents new evidence that RLH waves play a significant role in helicon plasma sources. An experimentally measured plasma density profile in an argon helicon discharge is used to calculate the rf field structure. The calculations are performed using a two–dimensional field solver under the assumption that the density profile is axisymmetric. It is found that RLH waves with an azimuthal wave number m=1 form a standing wave structure in the axial direction and that the frequency of the RLH eigenmode is close to the driving frequency of the rf antenna. The calculated resonant power absorption, associated with the RLH eigenmode, accounts for most of the rf power deposited into the plasma in the experiment.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pop/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.2402913/16121299/123507_1_online.pdf",""

An intron 1 splice donor site mutation of the Waxy gene is responsible for the absence of amylose in glutinous rice varieties. This mutation appears to have also played an important role in the origin of low amylose, nonglutinous temperate japonica rice varieties, which form a primary component of Northeast Asian cuisines. Waxy DNA sequence analyses indicate that the splice donor mutation is prevalent in temperate japonica rice varieties, but rare or absent in tropical japonica, indica, aus, and aromatic varieties. Sequence analysis across a 500-kb genomic region centered on Waxy reveals patterns consistent with a selective sweep in the temperate japonicas associated with the mutation. The size of the selective sweep (&gt;250 kb) indicates very strong selection in this region, with an inferred selection coefficient that is higher than similar estimates from maize domestication genes or wild species.

Emerging studies suggest that in addition to the nuclear localization of PELP1, it is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm in human breast tumors, leading to excessive nongenomic signaling and possibly to tamoxifen resistance. The mechanisms underlying resistance to hormones in preclinical model systems remain under intense investigation. In an effort to develop a model system to treat tumor cells with cytoplasmic PELP1 expression and tamoxifen resistance, here we used the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. We found that clones of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells overexpressing PELP1 in the cytoplasm were distinctly sensitive to TNF-α-induced apoptosis than were wild-type nuclear PELP1– and pcDNA vector–expressing clones as revealed by cell growth assay, cell cycle analysis, Annexin V staining, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay. We also found that the clones with cytoplasmic PELP1 overexpression had significantly less antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and nuclear factor-κB DNA binding, but increased cyclin E expression, further supporting evidence that these cells are sensitive to apoptosis. The mechanism behind TNF-induced apoptosis in these cells involves caspases, as revealed by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-inhibited apoptosis. In conclusion, our results suggest that altered localization of PELP1 promotes heightened sensitivity to TNF-α in MCF-7 cells, paving the way for developing new treatment strategies for tumors with cytoplasmic PELP1 expression.

Relationships are examined between dive profiles and acoustic backscatter intensity measurements from the main deep scattering layer (DSL) at a daytime depth of 400–600 m. Passive detections of creaks, believed to be associated with prey acquisition, are merged with dive profiles to provide insight between mid-water backscatter returns and foraging effort. Results to date indicate whales diving in three depth ranges: deeper than 800 m, between 500 and 800 m, and less than 500 m. Dive patterns indicate some whales dive through the main DSL into deeper secondary layers seen by the 38-kHz ADCP. There seems to be no difference in dive patterns between night and day.

MCP-1−/− or C57Bl/6J control mice [wild-type (WT)] underwent femoral artery excision (FAE). Muscles were collected for histology, assessment of tissue chemokines, and activity measurements of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and myeloperoxidase. In MCP-1−/− mice, restoration of perfusion was delayed, and LDH and fiber size, indicators of muscle regeneration, were decreased. Altered inflammation was observed with increased neutrophil accumulation in MCP-1−/− versus WT mice at Days 1 and 3 (P≤0.003), whereas fewer macrophages were present in MCP-1−/− mice at Day 3. As necrotic tissue was removed in WT mice, macrophages decreased (Day 7). In contrast, macrophage accumulation in MCP-1−/− was increased in association with residual necrotic tissue and impaired muscle regeneration. Consistent with altered inflammation, neutrophil chemotactic factors (keratinocyte-derived chemokine and macrophage inflammatory protein-2) were increased at Day 1 post-FAE. The macrophage chemotactic factor MCP-5 was increased significantly in WT mice at Day 3 compared with MCP-1−/− mice. However, at post-FAE Day 7, MCP-5 was significantly elevated in MCP-1−/− mice versus WT mice. Addition of exogenous MCP-1 did not induce proliferation in murine myoblasts (C2C12 cells) in vitro. MCP-1 is essential for reperfusion and the successful completion of normal skeletal muscle regeneration after ischemic tissue injury. Impaired muscle regeneration in MCP-1−/− mice suggests an important role for macrophages and MCP-1 in tissue reparative processes.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1189%2Fjlb.0506356",""

Correlation functions obtained from the trajectories of length less than 100 times the correlation time constant (τℓ) exhibit significant deviations from the true correlation function. The distributions of sample time constants (τF) and stretching exponents (βF) are mapped by fitting a large number of rotational trajectories to stretched exponentials. As the trajectory length gets smaller, the distributions become broader and asymmetric and their mean values deviate from the true value predicted by pure rotational diffusion. Analysis based on higher order spherical harmonics is suggested as a method for minimizing the effect of the trajectory length. The distributions of time constants for different higher order spherical harmonics are also compared. While the focus of the paper is on rotational correlation functions, the general conclusions apply to any dynamical process that yields an exponentially decaying correlation function.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.2352748/15389231/124701_1_online.pdf",""

With computer-simulations of traffic scenes, we measured TTC judgments of self motion or object motion at constant and non-constant velocities. We also measured judgments at different levels of headway and viewing duration because rear-end collisions often occur with short headways and during driver distractions. Observers typically underestimated TTC when the virtual self accelerated toward a lead car.

This aperture illusion is relevant to the design of technologies that limit an observer's field of view, for example, cameras used in minimally-invasive surgery. Thus, it is important to determine the conditions under which the illusion occurs and how to eliminate it. In prior studies of the aperture illusion, observers passively viewed displays in which a line moved behind an aperture. Here, we demonstrated that the illusion occurred when participants actively controlled the line's motion. Furthermore, the aperture illusion was smaller with a rectangular aperture compared with a circle or octagon.

Correlation functions obtained from the trajectories of length less than 100 times the correlation time constant (τℓ) exhibit significant deviations from the true correlation function. The distributions of sample time constants (τF) and stretching exponents (βF) are mapped by fitting a large number of rotational trajectories to stretched exponentials. As the trajectory length gets smaller, the distributions become broader and asymmetric and their mean values deviate from the true value predicted by pure rotational diffusion. Analysis based on higher order spherical harmonics is suggested as a method for minimizing the effect of the trajectory length. The distributions of time constants for different higher order spherical harmonics are also compared. While the focus of the paper is on rotational correlation functions, the general conclusions apply to any dynamical process that yields an exponentially decaying correlation function.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.2352748/15389231/124701_1_online.pdf",""

MCP-1−/− or C57Bl/6J control mice [wild-type (WT)] underwent femoral artery excision (FAE). Muscles were collected for histology, assessment of tissue chemokines, and activity measurements of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and myeloperoxidase. In MCP-1−/− mice, restoration of perfusion was delayed, and LDH and fiber size, indicators of muscle regeneration, were decreased. Altered inflammation was observed with increased neutrophil accumulation in MCP-1−/− versus WT mice at Days 1 and 3 (P≤0.003), whereas fewer macrophages were present in MCP-1−/− mice at Day 3. As necrotic tissue was removed in WT mice, macrophages decreased (Day 7). In contrast, macrophage accumulation in MCP-1−/− was increased in association with residual necrotic tissue and impaired muscle regeneration. Consistent with altered inflammation, neutrophil chemotactic factors (keratinocyte-derived chemokine and macrophage inflammatory protein-2) were increased at Day 1 post-FAE. The macrophage chemotactic factor MCP-5 was increased significantly in WT mice at Day 3 compared with MCP-1−/− mice. However, at post-FAE Day 7, MCP-5 was significantly elevated in MCP-1−/− mice versus WT mice. Addition of exogenous MCP-1 did not induce proliferation in murine myoblasts (C2C12 cells) in vitro. MCP-1 is essential for reperfusion and the successful completion of normal skeletal muscle regeneration after ischemic tissue injury. Impaired muscle regeneration in MCP-1−/− mice suggests an important role for macrophages and MCP-1 in tissue reparative processes.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1189%2Fjlb.0506356",""

When these plants become established and widespread, the floristic composition of native plant communities becomes simplified, which can result in long-term and often irreversible habitat degradation for birds and other animals. Until recently, few studies have focused on the effect of invasive exotic grasses on breeding birds in southwestern rangelands. During the 2001 and 2002 breeding seasons (May-June), we compared the abundance and species richness of breeding birds, native flora, and arthropods on South Texas rangeland plots dominated by native grasses and plots dominated by two invasive exotic grasses, Lehmann lovegrass (Eragrostis lehmanniana) and buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciliaris). Native-grass cover was >400% greater on native-grass sites than on exotic-grass sites. Forb and grass species-richness were higher on native-grass sites. Shrub canopy cover, bare ground, and vegetation height measurements were similar on native-grass and exotic-grass sites. Overall bird abundance was 32% greater on native-grass sites than on exotic-grass sites. Lark Sparrows (Chondestes grammacus) were 73% more abundant on native-grass sites. Four other species—Black-throated Sparrow (Amphispiza bilineata), Northern Mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos), Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), and Cassin’s Sparrow (Aimophilla cassini)— were 26–70% more abundant on native-grass sites. The guild of birds that foraged on the ground under open brush canopies was almost twice as abundant on native-grass sites. Arthropod abundance was 60% greater on the native-grass site we sampled. Specifically, spiders, beetles, and ants were 42–83% more abundant on a native-grass site than on a buffelgrass site. Compared with rangelands dominated by native vegetation, areas dominated by Lehmann lovegrass and buffelgrass in South Texas appear to provide less suitable habitat for breeding birds, especially for bird species that forage on or near the ground.","http://academic.oup.com/auk/article-pdf/123/1/171/29691384/auk0171.pdf",""

Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy revealed a Stranski-Krastanov mode of iron island growth on tantalum with relatively small contact angles controlled by the relative surface energies of the supporting layer, the catalyst, and their interface. The as-formed iron island morphology promoted vertical growth of carbon nanotubes.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.2382735/14363466/183113_1_online.pdf",""

Background: Drivers cannot see an entire traffic scene clearly with one glance. They must extrapolate the motion of surrounding vehicles while scanning other parts of the scene. Further, abilities relevant to motion extrapolation decline with age. Thus, it is important to evaluate age differences in motion extrapolation. Method: Displays simulated car-following scenes. After an interruption, the scene reappeared at the correct position in its trajectory or at a position that was more advanced or less advanced than the correct position. Drivers reported whether the scene reappeared at the correct position. Results: When the virtual self moved faster than the lead car, older drivers' judgments were biased toward less advanced reappearance positions. Younger drivers' judgments were biased toward more advanced positions. The implication is that older drivers extrapolated the motion slower than did younger drivers. Conclusion: Distortions occurred in motion extrapolation of car-following scenes, and age differences occurred in such distortions. Application: Potential applications of this research include traffic safety. Age differences in motion extrapolation are useful to consider in differential accident patterns of younger and older drivers. Future research should investigate the relationship between accidents and the ability to extrapolate motion, particularly during driver distractions.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1518/001872006779166352",""

Spontaneous and NNK-induced chromosomal damage were significantly higher in lung cancer patients compared with controls. Forty-seven percent of cases (versus 12% of controls) had ≥4 spontaneous micronuclei, 66% of cases (and no controls) had ≥4 spontaneous nucleoplasmic bridges, and 25% of cases (versus 5% of controls) had ≥1 spontaneous nuclear bud (P &lt; 0.001). Similarly, 40% of cases (versus 6% of the controls) had ≥5 NNK-induced micronuclei, 89% of cases (and no controls) had ≥6 induced nucleoplasmic bridges, and 23% of cases (versus 2% of controls) had ≥2 induced nuclear buds (P &lt; 0.001). When analyzed on a continuous scale, spontaneous micronuclei, nucleoplasmic bridges, and nuclear buds were associated with 2-, 29-, and 6-fold increases in cancer risk, respectively. Similarly, NNK-induced risks were 2.3-, 45.5-, and 10-fold, respectively. We evaluated the use of CBMN assay to predict cancer risk based on the numbers of micronuclei, nucleoplasmic bridges, and nuclear buds defined by percentile cut points in controls. Probabilities of being a cancer patient were 96%, 98%, and 100% when using the 95th percentiles of spontaneous and NNK-induced micronuclei, nucleoplasmic bridges, and nuclear buds, respectively.

Polymorphisms in members of the p53 family, such as p53 and p73, that have a functional relevance would be predicted to contribute to the disease phenotype. In this analysis, we used genotype data from 863 lung cancer cases and 852 healthy controls to test for multigenetic effects of polymorphisms at p53 exon 4, introns 3 and 6, and at p73 exon 2. All individuals in this analysis were self-reported non–Hispanic Caucasians. When the p73 and p53 variant alleles were combined and analyzed as a continuous variable, there was a 13% increase [odds ratios (OR), 1.13; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.05-1.21] in lung cancer risk for each additional variant allele. Furthermore, when the number of variant alleles was categorized into three groups (zero, one to three, and four or more variants), there was evidence of a gene-dosage effect with increased risks for individuals with one to three variants (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.05-1.61) and four or more variants (OR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.23-2.56).

Younger individuals with four or more variants were also at a significantly increased risk for lung cancer (OR, 3.15; 95% CI, 1.62-6.12).

The P3HT film thickness varies from 11to186nm. The devices have channel lengths of 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80μm and a channel width of 500μm. The mobility and on/off ratio are up to 0.08cm2∕Vs and 7×103, respectively. The drain current and the mobility increase with thickness. At the same P3HT thickness, the drain current and mobility become higher when the channel length is reduced. The on/off ratio decreases quickly and then saturates for thickness &gt;64nm. Short channel devices have higher on/off ratio than long channel devices. For short channel devices (5μm), the on/off ratio does not change significantly with thickness. The devices with shorter channel length and thicker P3HT films tend to have smaller threshold voltages. The threshold voltage saturates for long channel (20–80μm) devices, for films thicker than 110nm. The gate leakage (ID offset) is higher for thicker film devices.

The relative electronic product branching ratios at 355nm and from 278to281.5nm were determined. We have investigated the excited state dynamics based on both the product branching and the photofragment angular distributions. We find that above the O(D21) threshold the contribution of the direct excitation to states other than the AΠ3∕22 state and the role of curve crossing is considerably larger in BrO compared to that observed for ClO, in agreement with recent theoretical studies. The measurement of low velocity photofragments resulting from photodissociation just above the O(D21) threshold provides an accurate and direct determination of the AΠ3∕22 state dissociation threshold of 35418±35cm−1, leading to a ground state bond energy of D00(BrO)=55.9±0.1kcal∕mol.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.2173265/15379800/134304_1_online.pdf",""

The resulting films were studied as a function of ALD cycle number on Si(100) surfaces prepared with chemical oxide, HF last, and NH3 annealing. TEMAHf+O3 growth is independent of surface preparation, while HfCl4+H2O shows a surface dependence. Rutherford backscattering shows that HfCl4+H2O coverage per cycle is l3% of a monolayer on chemical oxide while TEMAHf+O3 coverage per cycle is 23% of a monolayer independent of surface. Low energy ion scattering, x-ray reflectivity, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to understand film continuity, density, and chemical bonding. TEMAHf+O3 ALD shows continuous films, density &gt;9g∕cm3, and bulk Hf–O bonding after 15 cycles [physical thickness (Tphys)=1.2±0.2nm] even on H-terminated Si(100). Conversely, on H-terminated Si(100), HfCl4+H2O requires 50 cycles (Tphys∼3nm) for continuous films and bulk Hf–O bonding. TEMAHf+O3 ALD was implemented in HfO2∕TiN transistor gate stacks, over the range 1.2nm⩽Tphys⩽3.3nm. Electrical results are consistent with material analysis suggesting that at Tphys=1.2nm HfO2 properties begin to deviate from thick film properties. At Tphys=1.2nm, electrical thickness scaling slows, gate current density begins to deviate from scaling trendlines, and no hard dielectric breakdown occurs. Most importantly, n-channel transistors show improvement in peak and high field electron mobility as Tphys scales from 3.3 to 1.2nm. This improvement may be attributed to reduced charge trapping and Coulomb scattering in thinner films. Scaled HfO2 enables 1nm equivalent oxide thickness and 82% of universal SiO2 mobility.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.2161819/14962593/023508_1_online.pdf",""

The simulated diffusion couple comprised the two terminal phases, Cu and Sn, as well as the two intermetallic phases, Cu3Sn and Cu6Sn5, formed between them. The diffusion and electromigration parameters were obtained by solving the inverse problem of the electromigration enhanced intermetallic growth, and they were compatible with the literature values. Finite difference method was applied to the whole simulated domain to solve for the mass transport kinetics within the intermetallic phases and across each interface of interest. Simulation showed that, when electromigration effect was absent (zero current), intermetallic growth followed a parabolic law, suggesting a diffusion controlled mechanism for thermal aging. However, under significant current stressing (4×104A∕cm2), the growth of the dominant intermetallic Cu6Sn5 clearly followed a linear law, suggesting a reaction controlled mechanism for electromigration. Simulation results were consistent with the experimental observations. The analysis of vacancy transport was also incorporated with the model, and the results showed substantial increase in vacancy concentration at the Cu6Sn5 phase near the Cu3Sn∕Cu6Sn5 interface. The peaking of the vacancy concentration explains the substantial Kirkendall void formation under electromigration at this region.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.2359135/6167404/084909_1_online.pdf",""

Their replication proceeds in the cytoplasm of infected cells and does not directly depend on nuclei. Alphaviruses encode only four nonstructural proteins that are required for the replication of viral genome and transcription of the subgenomic RNA. However, the replicative enzyme complexes (RCs) appear to include cellular proteins and assemble on cellular organelles. We have developed a set of recombinant Sindbis (SIN) viruses with green fluorescent protein (GFP) insertions in one of the nonstructural proteins, nsP3, to further understand the RCs' genesis and structure. We studied the assembly of nsP3/GFP-containing protein complexes at different stages of infection and isolated a combination of cellular proteins that are associated with SIN nsP3. We demonstrated the following. (i) SIN nsP3 can tolerate the insertion of GFP into different fragments of the coding sequence; the designed recombinant viruses are viable, and their replication leads to the assembly of nsP3/GFP chimeric proteins into gradually developing, higher-order structures differently organized at early and late times postinfection. (ii) At late times postinfection, nsP3 is assembled into complexes of similar sizes, which appear to be bound to cytoskeleton filaments and can aggregate into larger structures. (iii) Protein complexes that are associated with nsP3/GFP contain a high concentration of cytoskeleton proteins, chaperones, elongation factor 1A, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, 14-3-3 proteins, and some of the ribosomal proteins. These proteins are proposed to be essential for SIN RC formation and/or functioning.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.80.8.4122-4134.2006",""

Subgrade moisture content varies with environmental and soil conditions and has significant influence on pavement performance. Thus, it is important to establish realistic estimates of expected subgrade moisture contents to account for the effects of this variable on predicted pavement performance during the design stage properly. To predict expected moisture contents, researchers examined regional variations in climatic and soil–water characteristic curves in Texas. Through cluster analysis, seven climatic and nine soil regions were established that captured the variations in climatic and soil characteristics across the state. Typical pavement structures and groundwater table data in different regions were used to reflect regional characteristics and to estimate the initial boundary soil suction profile for a given pavement, which is a critical factor in determining expected moisture variations in the subgrade for given pavement and climatic and soil conditions. The limited verification of the EICM analysis showed realistic predictions of moisture contents when compared with field measurements and confirmed that the results of the regional characterizations are reasonable. Accordingly, researchers evaluated the expected moisture variations across different regions. The results indicate that in most pavements the predicted moisture contents reach an equilibrium stage at some time after construction. From these results, researchers established expected moisture contents that reflect the variation in environmental and soil characteristics across Texas.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0361198106196700114",""

Similar to mammalian organisms, Drosophila has two O-mannosyltransferase genes, rotated abdomen (rt) and DmPOMT2, encoding proteins with high homology to their mammalian counterparts. The previously reported mutant phenotype of the rt gene includes a clockwise rotation of the abdomen and defects in embryonic muscle development. No mutants have been described so far for the DmPOMT2 locus. In this study, we determined that the mutation in the twisted (tw) locus, tw1, corresponds to a DmPOMT2 mutant. The twisted alleles represent a complementation group of recessive mutations that, similar to the rt mutants, exhibit a clockwise abdomen rotation phenotype. Several tw alleles were isolated in the past; however, none of them was molecularly characterized. We used an expression rescue approach to confirm that tw locus represents DmPOMT2 gene. We found that the tw1 allele represents an amino acid substitution within the conserved PMT domain of DmPOMT2 (TW) protein. Immunostaining experiments revealed that the protein products of both rt and tw genes colocalize within Drosophila cells where they reside in the ER subcellular compartment. In situ hybridization analysis showed that both genes have essentially overlapping patterns of expression throughout most of embryogenesis (stages 8–17), while only the rt transcript is present at early embryonic stages (5 and 6), suggesting its maternal origin. Finally, we analyzed the genetic interactions between rt and tw using several mutant alleles, RNAi, and ectopic expression approaches. Our data suggest that the two Drosophila O-mannosyltransferase genes, rt and tw, have nonredundant functions within the same developmental cascade and that their activities are required simultaneously for possibly the same biochemical process. Our results establish the possibility of using Drosophila as a model system for studying molecular and genetic mechanisms of protein O-mannosylation during development.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/172/1/343/42068499/genetics0343.pdf",""

Inhibition of aldose reductase (AR; EC. 1.1.1.21.) by sorbinil or by antisense ablation prevented fibroblast growth factor–induced and platelet-derived growth factor–induced up-regulation of PGE2 synthesis in human colon cancer cells, Caco-2. AR besides reducing aldo-sugars efficiently reduces toxic lipid aldehydes and their conjugates with glutathione. Inhibition of AR prevented growth factor-induced COX-2 activity, protein, and mRNA and significantly decreased activation of nuclear factor-κB and protein kinase C (PKC) and phosphorylation of PKC-β2 as well as progression of Caco-2 cell growth but had no effect on COX-1 activity. Cell cycle analysis suggests that inhibition of AR prevents growth factor-induced proliferation of Caco-2 cells at S phase. Treatment of Caco-2 cells with the most abundant and toxic lipid aldehyde 4-hydroxy-trans-2-nonenal (HNE) or its glutathione-conjugate [glutathionyl-HNE (GS-HNE)] or AR-catalyzed product of GS-HNE, glutathionyl-1,4-dihydroxynonane (GS-DHN), resulted in increased COX-2 expression and PGE2 production. Inhibition of AR prevented HNE- or GS-HNE-induced but not GS-DHN-induced up-regulation of COX-2 and PGE2. More importantly, in vivo studies showed that administration of AR-small interfering RNA (siRNA), but not control siRNA, to nude mice bearing SW480 human colon adenocarcinoma cells completely arrested tumor progression. Collectively, these observations suggest that AR is an obligatory mediator of growth factor-induced up-regulation of COX-2, PGE2, and growth of Caco-2 cells, indicating that inhibition of AR may be a novel therapeutic approach in preventing the progression of colon cancer.

By utilizing an electroexplosive fuse, a large dI∕dt into a coupled load is possible. Our previous work with a nonoptimized fuse has produced ∼100kV into a 15Ω load, which leads into a regime relevant for high power microwave systems. It is expected that ∼300kV can be achieved with the present two-stage HFCG driving an inductive storage system with electroexploding fuse. In order to optimize the electroexplosive wire fuse, we have constructed a nonexplosive test bed which simulates the HFCG output with high accuracy. We have designed and implemented a capacitor based, magnetic switching scheme to generate the near exponential rise of the HFCG. The varying inductance approach utilizes four stages of inductance change and is based upon a piecewise linear regression model of the HFCG wave form. The nonexplosive test bed will provide a more efficient method of component testing and has demonstrated positive initial fuse results. By utilizing the nonexplosive test bed, we hope to reduce the physical size of the inductive energy storage system and fuse substantially.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/rsi/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.2336757/13476573/094702_1_online.pdf",""

O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is critical for repairing damage to the O6-position of guanine. Therefore, we tested our hypothesis that genetic variants of MGMT are associated with increased lung cancer risk in a Caucasian population of 1,121 lung cancer patients and 1,163 matched cancer-free controls. We genotyped four potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of MGMT: exon 3 codon 84C → T (L84F), exon 5 codon 143A → G (I143V), and two promoter SNPs 135G → T and 485C → A. The allele frequency distributions of the SNPs of codon 84C → T and the promoter 135G → T in the cases were borderline different from that in the controls. After defining the minor allele (T for codon 84C → T and G for codon 143A → G) as the variant allele, we categorized the MGMT genotypes as either 0 variants (84CC-143AA) or 1-4 variants. Compared with 0 variants, those with 1-4 variants showed a statistically significantly increased risk of lung cancer (P = 0.040). Further stratification analysis showed that this increased risk was more pronounced in women, current smokers, and non–small cell lung cancer. We did not find any association between the MGMT promoter SNPs and lung cancer risk. Our findings suggest that non-synonymous SNPs in MGMT are associated with modestly increased risk of lung cancer in Caucasians and need to be further investigated.

In animal cells it induces the production of reactive oxygen species through the mediation of NADPH oxidase. Similarly, here we report that in leaves of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), applied ATP, but not AMP or phosphate, induces the accumulation of superoxide (O2  −) in a biphasic, dose-dependent manner, with a threshold at 500 nm ATP. This effect did not require ATP hydrolysis for it was mimicked by ATPγS. ATP also induced increased levels of Arabidopsis respiratory burst oxidase homolog D (AtrbohD) mRNA, but ATP-treated plants that had disrupted AtrbohD and AtrbohF genes did not accumulate O2  −, indicating that NADPH oxidases are responsible for the induced O2  − accumulation. Inhibitors of mammalian P2-type ATP receptors abolished ATP-induced O2  − production, suggesting that the ATP effects may be mediated through P2-like receptors in plants. Cytosolic Ca2+ and calmodulin are likely to help transduce the ATP responses, as they do in animal cells, because a Ca2+ channel blocker, a Ca2+ chelator, and calmodulin antagonist all reduced ATP-induced O2  − accumulation. Furthermore, ATP treatment enhanced the expression of genes that are induced by wounds and other stresses. The ATP measured at wound sites averaged 40 μ  m, well above the level needed to induce O2  − accumulation and gene expression changes. Transgenic plants overexpressing an apyrase gene had reduced O2  − production in response to applied ATP and wounding. Together, these data suggest a possible role for extracellular ATP as a signal potentially in wound and stress responses.","http://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-pdf/140/4/1222/38098691/plphys_v140_4_1222.pdf",""

Low loss polymer waveguide bend structures, employing both offsets and trenches, were fabricated. A reduction of the 180° bend insertion loss from 17.7to3.0dB with a bending radius (BR) of 1.5mm is experimentally confirmed at λ=1.55μm. BR ranging from 5to0.5mm are evaluated with decent match when compared with simulation results. The polarization dependent loss is BR dependent with a maximum value of 0.4dB when the BR is reduced to 0.5mm.

Each wiring level connects to the levels above and below it through via layers. The dual damascene approach to fabricating these interconnected structures creates a wiring level and a via level simultaneously, thereby reducing the total number of processing steps. However, the dual damascene strategy (of which there are several variations) still requires around 20 process steps per wiring layer. In this work, an approach to damascene processing that is based on step-and-flash imprint lithography (SFIL) is discussed. This imprint damascene process requires fewer than half as many steps as the standard photolithographic dual damascene approach. Through use of a template with two tiers of patterning, a single imprint lithography step can replace two photolithography steps. Further improvements in efficiency are possible if the imprint material is itself a functional dielectric material. This work is a demonstration of the compatibility of imprint lithography (specifically SFIL) with back-end-of-line processing using a dual damascene approach with functional materials.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-pdf/24/3/1283/15640713/1283_1_online.pdf",""

The assignment of more than 70 transitions has allowed a detailed energy map of both the S0 and S1 states of the ring-puckering (ν45) vibration to be determined in the excited states of nine other vibrations, including the ring-flapping (ν43) and ring-twisting (ν44) vibrations. Despite some interaction with ν43 and ν44, a one-dimensional potential energy function for the ring puckering very nicely predicts the experimentally determined energy level spacings. In the S1(π,π*) state coumaran is quasiplanar with a barrier to planarity of 34cm−1 and with energy minima at puckering angles of ±14°. The corresponding ground state (S0) values are 154cm−1 and ±25°. As is the case with the related molecules indan, phthalan, and 1,3-benzodioxole, the angle strain in the five-membered ring increases upon the π→π* transition within the benzene ring and this increases the rigidity of the attached ring. Theoretical calculations predict the expected increases of the carbon-carbon bond lengths of the benzene ring in S1, and they predict a barrier of 21cm−1 for this state. The bond length increases at the bridgehead carbon-carbon bond upon electron excitation to the S1(π,π*) state give rise to angle changes which result in greater angle strain and a nearly planar molecule.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.2208616/14792071/034308_1_online.pdf",""

Hypothesis: A pain control protocol involving a continuous ropivacaine femoral nerve block will decrease pain and narcotic use in the first 24 hours after surgery compared with a postoperative pain control protocol involving an intra-articular injection of bupivacaine/morphine. Study Design: Randomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Ninety subjects, aged 15 years or older, who were receiving arthroscopically assisted bone–patellar tendon–bone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction were randomly assigned to 2 groups. The first group received a ropivacaine continuous femoral nerve block and oral hydrocodone (block group). The second group received an intra-articular bupivacaine/morphine injection and oral oxycodone (injection group). Patients in both groups could receive intramuscular injection of hydromorphone for breakthrough pain; most patients in the block group also received bolus doses of ropivacaine through the femoral catheter. Subjects rated their worst, average, and current pain levels using a visual analog scale and category-ratio scale the morning after surgery. Postoperative narcotic pain medication use was converted to morphine-equivalent doses. Results: Postoperative pain ratings did not differ between the treatment groups. The largest difference in pain ratings between the groups was 0.5 cm for worst pain level (P = .345). Total narcotic use did not differ significantly between groups (1.1 morphine equivalent doses in both groups; P = .671). Conclusions: Continuous femoral block with ropivacaine appeared to have no clinical advantage in the immediate postoperative period after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction when compared with an intra-articular injection of bupivacaine/morphine. Both methods are effective for pain control after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0363546505286145",""

The project goal was to create instructional resources that emphasized active learning in undergraduate anatomy and physiology classrooms. The resources (activity modules and professional development) addressed two factors thought to be limiting science education reform: instructors' knowledge of how to implement active learning instruction and time to design innovative curricula. Volunteer instructors with a strong interest in using active learning in their classrooms were recruited to use the ITIP modules and provide ease-of-use feedback and student assessment data. As the study unfolded, instructor attrition was higher than had been anticipated, with 17 of 36 instructors withdrawing. More surprisingly, instructors remaining with the project failed to use the modules and reported specific obstacles that precluded module use, including lack of support from academic leadership, unplanned class size increases and heavy teaching loads, a union strike, insufficient time to develop a mindset for change, inadequate technology/funding, an adverse human subjects ruling, incompatibility of modules with instructors' established content and expectations, and personal factors. Despite the lack of module use and obstacles, 8 of 19 site testers began independently to introduce new active learning instruction into their classrooms. In the larger picture, however, it is important to note that only 8 of the initial 36 volunteers (22%) actually ended up changing their instruction to include opportunities for student active learning. These findings underscore the difficulty of implementing instructional change in college classrooms.","https://journals.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/advan.00064.2006",""

Recent advances in nanomaterials synthesis and characterization methods have enabled direct experimental investigation of the nanoscale size effects on thermoelectric properties. In this work, bismuth nanowires are synthesized by vapor deposition into the pores of anodic alumina membranes (AAMs) with variable pore sizes. The thermoelectric properties of individual Bi nanowires obtained from the AAMs were characterized using a new design of a microfabricated device. The presence of a highly stable bismuth oxide coating prohibited good electrical contact with the nanowire, but still allowed for thermal conductivity data to be obtained.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2006-13934/4573041/147_1.pdf",""

One pathway involves CD4+ T cells, delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), and the culmination in ischemic necrosis of the tumor and phthisis (atrophy) of the eye. The second pathway is DTH-independent and does not inflict collateral injury to ocular tissues, and the eye is preserved. In this study, we used a well-characterized tumor, Ad5E1, to analyze the role of IFN-γ in the nonphthisical form of intraocular tumor rejection. The results showed that IFN-γ induced tumor cell apoptosis, inhibited tumor cell proliferation, and promoted rejection by inhibiting angiogenesis. Microarray analysis revealed that IFN-γ induced up-regulation of five antiangiogenic genes and down-regulation of four proangiogenic genes in Ad5E1 tumor cells. Although IFN-γ knockout (KO) mice have progressively growing intraocular tumors, IFN-γ was not needed for the elimination of extraocular tumors, as all IFN-γ KO mice rejected s.c. tumor inocula. This represents a heretofore unrecognized role for IFN-γ in circumventing ocular immune privilege and eliminating intraocular tumors. The findings also reveal that some IFN-γ-independent tumor rejection processes are excluded from the eye and may represent a new facet of ocular immune privilege.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1189%2Fjlb.0806489",""

Here, a paradoxical result was obtained: PT of graphitelike hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) to superhard wurtzitic boron nitride under pressure and shear started at about the same pressure (∼10GPa) as under hydrostatic conditions. In situ x-ray diffraction measurement and modeling of the turbostratic stacking fault concentration (degree of disorder) and PT in hBN were performed. Under hydrostatic pressure, changes in the disorder were negligible. Under a complex compression and shear loading program, a strain-induced disorder was observed and quantitatively characterized. It is found that the strain-induced disorder suppresses PT which compensates the promotion effect of plastic shear. The existence of transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) was also proved during strain-induced PT. The degree of disorder is proposed to be used as a physical measure of plastic straining. This allows us to quantitatively separate the conventional plasticity and transformation-induced plasticity. Surprisingly, it is found that TRIP exceeds the conventional plasticity by a factor of 20. The cascade structural changes were revealed, defined as the reoccurrence of interacting processes including PTs, disordering, conventional plasticity, and TRIP. In comparison with hydrostatic loading, for the same degree of disorder, plastic shear indeed reduces the PT pressure (by a factor of 3–4) while causing a complete irreversible PT. The analytical results based on coupled strain-controlled kinetic equations for disorder and PT confirm our conclusions.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.2208353/13596798/044507_1_online.pdf",""

We hypothesized that IGF-IR and c-Met cooperate to induce migration and invasion of human pancreatic carcinoma cells and that IGF-I-mediated migration and invasion depend on c-Met. Migration and invasion assays were done with the human pancreatic cancer cell line L3.6pl treated with PBS, IGF-I, HGF, or IGF-I plus HGF. To determine if c-Met is necessary for IGF-IR-mediated migration and invasion, c-Met was down-regulated in L3.6pl cells via adenoviral infection with a c-Met ribozyme before IGF-I treatment. IGF-I and HGF increased cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, IGF-I plus HGF had a greater than additive effect on cell migration and invasion compared with either growth factor alone. Down-regulation of c-Met nearly completely inhibited IGF-I-mediated migration and invasion. Our findings suggest that IGF-IR and c-Met cooperate to induce migration and invasion of human pancreatic carcinoma cells. Furthermore, c-Met is required for both HGF- and IGF-I-mediated migration and invasion.

Sindbis virus (SIN) replication causes major changes in cellular macromolecular synthesis, in which the strong downregulation of transcription of cellular mRNAs and rRNAs plays a critical role. SIN nonstructural protein nsP2 was previously proposed as one of the main regulators of virus-host cell interactions, because point mutations in the carboxy-terminal part of nsP2 could make SIN and other alphaviruses and replicons less cytopathic and capable of persisting in some vertebrate cell lines. These mutants were incapable of inhibiting transcription and downregulating a viral stress-induced cell response. In the present work, we demonstrate that (i) SIN nsP2 is critically involved in CPE development, not only during the replication of SIN-specific RNAs, but also when this protein is expressed alone from different expression cassettes; (ii) the cytotoxic effect of SIN nsP2 appears to be at least partially determined by its ability to cause transcriptional shutoff; (iii) these functions of SIN nsP2 are determined by the integrity of the carboxy-terminal peptide of this protein located outside its helicase and protease domains, rather than by its protease activity; and (iv) the cytotoxic activity of SIN nsP2 depends on the presence of this protein in a free form, and alterations in P123 processing abolish the ability of nsP2 to cause CPE.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.02739-05",""

The binding of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to the TATA-box is accepted as essential in this process. It is known that the GR can interact in vitro with TBP, but the direct interaction of TBP with GR has not been previously characterized quantitatively and has not been appreciated as an important step in assembling the transcriptional complex. Herein, we demonstrate that the TBP-GR interaction is functionally significant by characterizing the association of TBP and GR in vitro by a combination of techniques and confirming the role of this interaction in vivo. Combined analysis, using native gel electrophoresis, sedimentation equilibrium, and isothermal microcalorimetry titrations, characterize the stoichiometry, affinity, and thermodynamics of the TBP-GR interaction. TBP binds recombinant GR activation function 1 (AF1) with a 1:2 stoichiometry and a dissociation constant in the nanomolar range. In vivo fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments, using fluorescently labeled TBP and various GR constructs, transiently transfected into CV-1 cells, show GR-TBP interactions, dependent on AF1. AF1-deletion variants showed fluorescence resonance energy transfer efficiencies on the level of coexpressed cyan fluorescent protein and yellow fluorescent protein, indicating that the interaction is dependent on AF1 domain. To demonstrate the functional role of the in vivo GR-TBP interaction, increased amounts of TBP expressed in vivo stimulated expression of GR-driven reporters and endogenous genes, and the effect was also specifically dependent on AF1.","http://academic.oup.com/mend/article-pdf/20/6/1218/10719619/mend1218.pdf",""

Thus it is of interest in understanding the genetic and cellular responses to hypoxia or anoxia in oxygen-deprivation-tolerant organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans. In C. elegans the DAF-2/DAF-16 pathway, an IGF-1/insulin-like signaling pathway, is involved with dauer formation, longevity, and stress resistance. In this report we compared the response of wild-type and daf-2(e1370) animals to anoxia. Unlike wild-type animals, the daf-2(e1370) animals have an enhanced anoxia-survival phenotype in that they survive long-term anoxia and high-temperature anoxia, do not accumulate significant tissue damage in either of these conditions, and are motile after 24 hr of anoxia. RNA interference was used to screen DAF-16-regulated genes that suppress the daf-2(e1370)-enhanced anoxia-survival phenotype. We identified gpd-2 and gpd-3, two nearly identical genes in an operon that encode the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. We found that not only is the daf-2(e1370)-enhanced anoxia phenotype dependent upon gpd-2 and gpd-3, but also the motility of animals exposed to brief periods of anoxia is prematurely arrested in gpd-2/3(RNAi) and daf-2(e1370);gpd-2/3(RNAi) animals. These data suggest that gpd-2 and gpd-3 may serve a protective role in tissue exposed to oxygen deprivation.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/174/3/1173/42084717/genetics1173.pdf",""

A two-dimensional, nonlinear, hydrostatic, nonrotating, and incompressible sea-breeze model is used for this purpose with buoyancy and vorticity as the prognostic variables and a square root filter with covariance localization is employed. To control filter divergence caused by the narrowing of parameter variance, a “conditional covariance inflation” method is devised. Up to six model parameters are subjected to estimation attempts in various experiments. While the estimation of single imperfect parameters results in error of model variables that is indistinguishable from the respective perfect-parameter cases, increasing the number of estimated parameters to six inevitably leads to a decline in the level of improvement achieved by parameter estimation. However, the overall EnKF performance in terms of the error statistics is still superior to the situation where there is parameter error but no parameter estimation is performed. In fact, compared with that situation, the simultaneous estimation of six parameters reduces the average error in buoyancy and vorticity by 40% and 46%, respectively.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/mwr/article-pdf/134/10/2951/4218445/mwr3224_1.pdf",""

Both the intrinsic and practical aspects of warm-season predictability, especially quantitative precipitation forecasts up to 36 h, were explored through experiments with various grid resolutions, initial and boundary conditions, physics parameterization schemes, and the addition of small-scale, small-amplitude random initial errors. It is found that the high-resolution convective-resolving simulations (with grid spacing down to 3.3 km) do not produce the best simulation or forecast. It was also found that both the realistic initial condition uncertainty and model errors can result in large forecast errors for this warm-season flooding event. Thus, practically, there is room to gain higher forecast accuracy through improving the initial analysis with better data assimilation techniques or enhanced observations, and through improving the forecast model with better-resolved or -parameterized physical processes. However, even if a perfect forecast model is used, small-scale, small-amplitude initial errors, such as those in the form of undetectable random noise, can grow rapidly and subsequently contaminate the short-term deterministic mesoscale forecast within 36 h. This rapid error growth is caused by moist convection. The limited deterministic predictability of such a heavy precipitation event, both practically and intrinsically, illustrates the need for probabilistic forecasts at the mesoscales.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/waf/article-pdf/21/2/149/4638705/waf909_1.pdf",""

Pavement treatments were selected to provide acceptable predicted performance at high levels of reliability, and the vertical movements were calculated both at the edges of pavements and beneath the outer wheelpaths. The case studies were based on a variety of traffic levels, site conditions, and sample testing. The pavement treatments included lime-stabilized and cement-stabilized layers, removal and replacement with inert layers, and vertical and horizontal moisture barriers. The results of the case studies showed that the PVR method overpredicts the swelling movement that can be expected with the new method and does not predict shrinkage movement, which is important because that is an indicator of future longitudinal shrinkage cracking along the pavement edge.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0361198106196700112",""

Even after gravel particles are crushed into smaller-size fractions, a significant proportion of the larger-size fractions retain their original shape and surface texture. As a result, HMA with a larger nominal maximum aggregate size (NMAS) has a higher percentage of rounded and low-angularity particles, which might make it more susceptible to rutting. Using a smaller NMAS may decrease the percentage of rounded and angular aggregates in the mix, but potentially at the expense of loss in shear strength of the mix. This study evaluated the effect of increasing aggregate angularity by decreasing NMAS on the rutting potential of HMA mixes containing siliceous gravels. Nine mix designs composed of three different NMASs and siliceous aggregates from three different sources were included in this study. The percentage of rounded and angular aggregates in each mix was quantified using image analysis and crushed-face count. The rutting potential of HMA mixes was assessed on the basis of Hamburg, dynamic modulus, flow time, and flow number tests. Results verify that a decrease in NMAS results in a decrease in the percentage of rounded and angular aggregates. However, rutting performance improves initially with a decrease in NMAS but then decreases; this indicates an optimum size that maximizes the rut resistance of HMA with siliceous aggregates. Results from this study are especially useful in selecting an optimum aggregate size for HMA mixes in locations where river gravels are the main source of locally available aggregates.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0361198106195200105",""

The practical implementation of the integral measurement and analysis system is demonstrated with the measurement of the wall shear stress of a microbubble laden boundary layer flow in a channel. The agreement in the results of the wall shear stress from the three synchronized measurements techniques was 93% for the single-phase case and 92.8% for the two-phase flow measurements. Moreover, independent measurements with each technique show no appreciable change in the values obtained when they were all synchronized.

In 2000, work started in Texas to evaluate the utility of infrared imaging for identifying segregation. Work conducted in Texas verified that temperature differentials did relate to changes in important hot-mix asphalt properties. This early work also showed that temperature differentials greater than 25°F (13.9°C) typically indicated problems in Texas mixes. With confidence in the utility of the technology, and recommended limits for temperature uniformity, Texas recently made substantial progress tailoring thermal data collection technology and data processing capabilities to hot-mix paving operations. The development and application of the current state of the practice for evaluating paving operations with thermal imaging in Texas are presented. The current methodology in Texas uses the Pave-IR system, which consists of a transverse bar with 10 infrared sensors immediately behind the paver, and the Pave-IR software package, which collects and displays the thermal profile in real time as the paving train progresses. In addition to real-time data display, Pave-IR can display in real time whether the paving temperatures fall within user-defined limits and, during paving Pave-IR, can provide a histogram of temperatures every 100 ft (30.5 m). Postprocessing functions in Pave-IR consist of data playback and review, spot temperature display, and creation of a histogram of the placement temperatures for the entire data file.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0361198106194600114",""

Here, we report that bortezomib inhibited docetaxel-induced M-phase arrest and apoptosis in androgen-dependent LNCaP-Pro5 cells. Direct analysis of kinase activity in immune complex kinase assays revealed that docetaxel activated cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 1 (CDC2) and that bortezomib blocked this activation. The effects of bortezomib were associated with accumulation of p21 and mimicked by chemical CDK inhibitors or by transfecting cells with a small interfering RNA construct specific for CDK1. Transient transfection with p21 also inhibited docetaxel-induced apoptosis; conversely, p21 silencing reversed the antagonistic effects of bortezomib on docetaxel-induced apoptosis. Together, our data show that bortezomib interferes with docetaxel-induced apoptosis via a p21-dependent mechanism that is associated with CDK1 inhibition. These observations may have important implications for the ongoing bortezomib-docetaxel combination trials as well as trials using bortezomib and other cell cycle–sensitive agents.

Here we show that glucose-induced activation of ERK1/2 is inhibited by epinephrine through the α2-adrenergic receptor. Epinephrine and the selective α2-adrenergic agonist UK14304 reduced insulin secretion and glucose-stimulated ERK1/2 activation in a pertussis toxin–sensitive manner, implicating the α subunit of a Gi family member. α2-adrenergic agonists also reduced stimulation of ERK1/2 by glucagon-like peptide 1 and KCl, but not by phorbol ester or nerve growth factor.

Although C5a is chemotactic for T cells, expression of C5a-R on murine T cells has been disputed. We report here that naïve, Con A-activated, and cytokine (IL-12, IL-18)-stimulated murine CD3+ T cells from three strains of mice [C57Bl/6, B10.nSn (C5+/+), B10.on (C5−/−)] lacked C5a-R, as evaluated by immunophenotyping with an anti-C5a-R mAb. Ligation of CD3 induced a modest up-regulation with 3% of CD3+ T cells expressing cell surface C5a-R. T cells primed by APC differentiate into effector T cells. Activation of mycobacteria [bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)]-sensitized T cells through MHC II and TCR interactions via BCG-infected macrophages enhanced the expression of C5a-R with ∼14% of CD3+ T cells positive for C5a-R. Comparable expression was found in C5+/+ as well as C5−/− strains of mice (14% and 15%, respectively). Furthermore, anti-CD3-activated T cells were primed by BCG-infected DC, and a larger proportion of the primed T cells expressed C5a-R (30–40%). Finally, mice infected with BCG showed significant numbers of CD3+ T cells expressing C5a-R in the spleens during infection. As APC, such as macrophages and DC, can secrete C5 and cleave C5 to C5a and C5b through a peptidase, we suggest that macrophage and DC-T cell interactions can up-regulate C5a-R on T cells through MHC II-TCR and provide a C5a peptide for additional local activation of T cells via C5a-R.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1189%2Fjlb.1005582",""

The apparatus allows the testing of specimens along a wide range of stress paths and stress levels that are not achievable in a conventional uniaxial or cylindrical apparatus. A multi-stage testing scheme can be followed by simultaneous control of the major, intermediate, and minor principal stresses directly applied to the specimens. Two cubical AC specimens cut from two WesTrack block samples were subjected to a series of multi-stage stress paths that included triaxial compression (TC), triaxial extension (TE), simple shear (SS), conventional triaxial compression (CTC), conventional triaxial extension (CTE), and cyclic conventional triaxial extension (CCTE). Experimental data were analyzed to assess volumetric creeping properties, resilient response, plastic deformation response, Poisson's ratio, loss angle, and dilatancy of asphalt concrete under general stress states. Test results highlight the potential of the cubical cell for mechanical characterization of asphalt concrete in a broad range of applications involving true triaxial stress states. Analysis of test results indicates all of the following: (a) Modulus of AC shows significant anisotropy in different orientations; (b) Volumetric creeping of AC is considerably significant at relatively high pressures; (c) AC shows significant dilatancy; and (d) Cubical Device can distinguish mixes of different performance.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/astm-ebooks/book/chapter-pdf/7211502/10_1520_stp37632s.pdf",""

The mean strain-rate tensor is of constant magnitude but the eigendirections rotate at a uniform rate or frequency. When the forcing frequency is zero, constant-shear forcing is recovered. The results indicate that there are three distinct regimes of physical behavior for this kind of forcing: (1) at low frequencies, turbulence quickly becomes one-componential and fluctuation field attains statistical steady state; (2) at intermediate frequencies, kinetic energy exhibits sporadic growth spurts interspersed with the periods of no activity; and (3) at relatively high frequencies, kinetic energy evolution exhibits a purely periodic behavior. It is rather intriguing that turbulence decays at low frequencies but grows at intermediate frequencies of forcing. We investigate the physics underlying the observed behavior and examine the roles of production and pressure-strain correlation. Finally, a simple dynamical model that captures the observed regimes of behavior is proposed. In this model the different turbulence responses are reproduced by merely introducing different phase lags between applied strain and Reynolds stress.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.2221951/16045919/085102_1_online.pdf",""

The study purpose was to document Hispanic access to hospice services in an environment where Hispanics are a majority population. The framework for the study was Aday and Anderson’s model for access to medical care. In this framework, access is not defined as availability of services and resources, but whether services are actually used by the people who need them. We completed retrospective chart reviews of 500 Medicare beneficiaries who died in four hospices. Study variables were decedent characteristics and access to hospice and hospice disciplines. Results showed that Hispanics and whites differed on characteristics known to influence access to health services, e.g., preferred language and type of caregiver. Although the proportion of Hispanic elders dying in hospice was less than the proportion living in the community, the proportions of Hispanic elders who died in the community or died in their homes were not different from the proportion that died in hospice. When access to hospice disciplines was compared between Hispanic and white decedents, the results showed one difference—more whites than Hispanics had access to volunteer services. Overall, the study showed that Hispanics were not underrepresented in hospice, and they had equal access to hospice disciplines. These findings differ from national data and may be associated with Hispanics being the majority population in the community. To learn how population dominance influences minority access to services, Hispanic access to hospice could be studied in locales with varying proportions of Hispanics in the population.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/104990910602300103",""

Therefore, the understanding of such mechanisms should improve the design of chemotherapy against prostate cancer. Galectin-3 (Gal-3), a multifunctional oncogenic protein involved in the regulation of tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis has shown antiapoptotic effects in certain cell types. Here, we show that the expression of exogenous Gal-3 in human prostate cancer LNCaP cells, which do not express Gal-3 constitutively, inhibits anticancer drug–induced apoptosis by stabilizing the mitochondria. Thus, Gal-3-negative cells showed 66.31% apoptosis after treatment with 50 μmol/L cis-diammine-dichloroplatinum for 48 hours, whereas two clones of Gal-3-expressing cells show only 2.92% and 1.42% apoptotic cells. Similarly, Gal-3-negative cells showed 43.8% apoptosis after treatment with 300 μmol/L etoposide for 48 hours, whereas only 15.38% and 14.51% of Gal-3-expressing LNCaP cells were apoptotic. The expression of Gal-3 stimulated the phosphorylation of Ser112 of Bcl-2-associated death (Bad) protein and down-regulated Bad expression after treatment with cis-diammine-dichloroplatinum. Gal-3 also inhibited mitochondrial depolarization and damage after translocation from the nuclei to the cytoplasm, resulting in inhibition of cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation. These findings indicate that Gal-3 inhibits anticancer drug–induced apoptosis through regulation of Bad protein and suppression of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Therefore, targeting Gal-3 could improve the efficacy of anticancer drug chemotherapy in prostate cancer.

In this study two forms of vascular medial involvement in toxic injury are examined. Early atherosclerotic plaques are studied by immunohistochemistry for an α class glutathione- S-transferase (GST) isozyme known as hGSTA4-4, which has preferential metabolic activity for α, β-unsaturated aldehydes derived from lipid peroxidation, especially 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal. Findings in human plaque indicate that hGST A4-4 is highly upregulated in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) within the plaque and in the medial VSMCs underlying plaque. Endothelial cells, while not expressing hGST A4-4 distant from plaques, were found to express the isozyme in cytoplasm overlying plaque. In a series of second experiments, we illustrate a developmental model of dissecting aortic aneurysm (DAA) obtained by administering semicarbazide, an inhibitor of the little-studied VSMC enzyme semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO), to pregnant rats during the last trimester of development. Newborn rats consistently developed DAA which is characterized by splitting of media of ascending thoracic aorta and extensive blood collections surrounding the vessel. These experimental examples emphasize the potential role of the media in toxic insults to blood vessels. Also, the potential importance of toxic injury to developing blood vessels by in utero exposure to xenobiotic substances is illustrated.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/01926230500369907",""

In bacteria, these signal transducers include sensor kinases, which typically control gene expression via response regulators, and methyl-accepting chemoreceptor proteins, which control flagellar rotation via the CheA kinase and CheY response regulator. We previously reported that a chimeric protein (Nart) that joins the ligand-binding, transmembrane, and linker regions of the NarX sensor kinase to the signaling and adaptation domains of the Tar chemoreceptor elicits a repellent response to nitrate and nitrite. As with NarX, nitrate evokes a stronger response than nitrite. Here we show that mutations targeting a highly conserved sequence (the P box) in the periplasmic domain alter chemoreception by Nart and signaling by NarX similarly. In particular, the G51R substitution converts Nart from a repellent receptor into an attractant receptor for nitrate. Our results underscore the conclusion that the fundamental mechanism of transmembrane signaling is conserved between homodimeric sensor kinases and chemoreceptors. They also highlight the plasticity of the coupling between ligand binding and signal output in these systems.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JB.00117-06",""

A central behavioral factor is the bees' responsiveness to sucrose, measured as their proboscis extension reflex. This study examines the genetics of this trait in diploid worker and haploid male honeybees (drones) to learn more about the genetic architecture of the overall behavioral syndrome, using original strains selected for pollen-hoarding behavior. We show that a significant proportion of the phenotypic variability is determined by genotype in males and workers. Second, our data present overwhelming evidence for pleiotropic effects of previously identified quantitative trait loci for foraging behavior (pln-QTL) and epistatic interactions among them. Furthermore, we report on three genomic QTL scans (two reciprocal worker backcrosses and one drone hybrid population) derived from our selection strains. We present at least one significant and two putative new QTL directly affecting the sucrose response of honeybees. Thus, this study demonstrates the modular genetic architecture of behavioral syndromes in general, and elucidates the genetic architecture of the pollen-hoarding behavioral syndrome in particular. Understanding this behavioral syndrome is important for understanding the division of labor in social insects and social evolution itself.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/172/1/243/42070604/genetics0243.pdf",""

Recent outbreaks in Venezuela and Colombia in 1995, involving an estimated 100,000 human cases, indicate that VEEV still poses a serious public health threat. To develop a safe, efficient vaccine that protects against disease resulting from VEEV infection, we generated chimeric Sindbis (SIN) viruses expressing structural proteins of different strains of VEEV and analyzed their replication in vitro and in vivo, as well as the characteristics of the induced immune responses. None of the chimeric SIN/VEE viruses caused any detectable disease in adult mice after either intracerebral (i.c.) or subcutaneous (s.c.) inoculation, and all chimeras were more attenuated than the vaccine strain, VEEV TC83, in 6-day-old mice after i.c. infection. All vaccinated mice were protected against lethal encephalitis following i.c., s.c., or intranasal (i.n.) challenge with the virulent VEEV ZPC738 strain (ZPC738). In spite of the absence of clinical encephalitis in vaccinated mice challenged with ZPC738 via i.n. or i.c. route, we regularly detected high levels of infectious challenge virus in the central nervous system (CNS). However, infectious virus was undetectable in the brains of all immunized animals at 28 days after challenge. Hamsters vaccinated with chimeric SIN/VEE viruses were also protected against s.c. challenge with ZPC738. Taken together, our findings suggest that these chimeric SIN/VEE viruses are safe and efficacious in adult mice and hamsters and are potentially useful as VEEV vaccines. In addition, immunized animals provide a useful model for studying the mechanisms of the anti-VEEV neuroinflammatory response, leading to the reduction of viral titers in the CNS and survival of animals.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.80.6.2784-2796.2006",""

We have clinical findings on five families with diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds who all harbor SQSTM1 UBA domain mutations (P387L, P392L, D391fsX394, P392fsX394). Intrafamilial expressivity was highly variable. The probands in two of the families had early-onset disease involving a large number of bones and highly elevated prediagnostic levels of serum alkaline phosphatase. Affected siblings in these same families had limited bone involvement and were only diagnosed by technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scans. Furthermore, there was at least one subject in each family with no evidence of Paget's disease, although they carried one mutated copy of the SQSTM1 gene. A total of 18 such individuals were identified across the five kindreds. Thus, the gene seems to have highly variable expressivity, as well as incomplete penetrance, supporting the role of this gene as a predisposition gene for familial Paget's disease of the bone. Molecular studies of the SQSTM1 protein showed different cellular aggregation phenotypes depending on the nature of the mutation. In general, the point mutations formed larger cytoplasmic aggregates than the wildtype or truncation mutations. This aggregation phenotype was not altered on removal of the N-terminal PB1 dimerization domain, implying that aggregate formation is not wholly mediated by interaction through the PB1 domain. Although there was a genotype/phenotype correlation on the cellular level, this was not apparent on the clinical level. This supports the argument that other nongenetic factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease.","https://academic.oup.com/jbmr/article-pdf/21/S2/P45/56479650/5650211309.pdf",""

Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) has been identified as an important molecule in spinal nociceptive processing and ensuing behavioral responses, but its contribution to synaptic plasticity, cellular mechanisms and site of action in the spinal cord remain to be determined. Here we address the role of CGRP in synaptic plasticity in the spinal dorsal horn in a model of arthritic pain. Results: Whole-cell current- and voltage-clamp recordings were made from substantia gelatinosa (SG) neurons in spinal cord slices from control rats and arthritic rats (> 6 h postinjection of kaolin/carrageenan into the knee). Monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were evoked by electrical stimulation of afferents in the dorsal root near the dorsal root entry zone. Neurons in slices from arthritic rats showed increased synaptic transmission and excitability compared to controls. A selective CGRP1 receptor antagonist (CGRP8-37) reversed synaptic plasticity in neurons from arthritic rats but had no significant effect on normal transmission. CGRP facilitated synaptic transmission in the arthritis pain model more strongly than under normal conditions where both facilitatory and inhibitory effects were observed. CGRP also increased neuronal excitability. Miniature EPSC analysis suggested a post- rather than pre-synaptic mechanism of CGRP action. Conclusion: This study is the first to show synaptic plasticity in the spinal dorsal horn in a model of arthritic pain that involves a postsynaptic action of CGRP on SG neurons.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1186/1744-8069-2-31",""

Moral intensity (Jones, 1991) is an issue-contingent model of ethical decision-making based on the supposition that situations vary in terms of the moral imperative present in that situation. An individual's decision is guided by his or her assessment of six different components that collectively comprise the moral intensity of the situation. The relationship between the components of moral intensity and the decision-making process is tested through the use of scenarios that present IS-related ethical situations. The results indicate that moral intensity plays a significant role in shaping the perceptions and intentions of individuals faced with IS-related ethical situations.

The notion of generating and servicing long-latency cache misses in parallel is called Memory Level Parallelism (MLP). MLP is not uniform across cache misses - some misses occur in isolation while some occur in parallel with other misses. Isolated misses are more costly on performance than parallel misses. However, traditional cache replacement is not aware of the MLP-dependent cost differential between different misses. Cache replacement, if made MLP-aware, can improve performance by reducing the number of performance-critical isolated misses. This paper makes two key contributions. First, it proposes a framework for MLP-aware cache replacement by using a runtime technique to compute the MLP-based cost for each cache miss. It then describes a simple cache replacement mechanism that takes both MLP-based cost and recency into account. Second, it proposes a novel, low-hardware overhead mechanism called Sampling Based Adaptive Replacement (SBAR), to dynamically choose between an MLP-aware and a traditional replacement policy, depending on which one is more effective at reducing the number of memory related stalls. Evaluations with the SPEC CPU2000 benchmarks show that MLP-aware cache replacement can improve performance by as much as 23%.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1150019.1136501",""

Normalization of embossing temperatures is performed to assess the HEMM process performance as a function of a normalized quantity that considers the glass transition, melting and embossing temperatures of a polymer. The performance comparison is based on evaluating the flow rate or measuring the height of an embossed feature for a given applied embossing pressure and holding time.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2006-14478/2782465/331_1.pdf",""

The mechanism of this depletion, however, is still unclear. Evidence suggests that lymphocytes die in lymph nodes, not in blood, and that uninfected bystander cells are the predominant cells dying. Our and others’ previous studies showed that the lymph node homing receptor, CD62 ligand (CD62L), and Fas are up-regulated on resting CD4+ T cells after HIV-1 binding and that these cells home to lymph nodes at an enhanced rate. uring the homing process, signals are induced through various homing receptors, which in turn, induced many of the cells to undergo apoptosis after they entered the lymph nodes. The purpose of this study was to determine how the homing process induces apoptosis in HIV-1-exposed, resting CD4+ T cells. We found that signaling through CD62L up-regulated FasL. This resulted in apoptosis of only HIV-1-presignaled, resting CD4+ T cells, not normal CD4+ T cells. This homing receptor-induced apoptosis could be blocked by anti-FasL antibodies or soluble Fas, demonstrating that the Fas-FasL interaction caused the apoptotic event.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1189%2Fjlb.0506338",""

Malignancies are also associated with the dysregulation of cell cycle events and concomitant elevated activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK). CDK2 is a key cell cycle regulatory protein that controls the transition of cells from G1 to S phase. In this study, we furnish several lines of evidence that show a functional role for the CDK2 in interleukin-1β (IL-1β)–induced COX-2 expression in H358 human non–small cell lung carcinoma cell line by blocking CDK2 activity. First, we show that BMS-387032, a potent CDK2 inhibitor, blocks IL-1β-induced expression as well as steady-state mRNA levels of COX-2. Second, we show that small interfering RNA that abrogates CDK2 expression also blocks IL-1β-induced COX-2 expression. Third, results from in vitro kinase assays clearly show that IL-1β induces CDK2 activity in H358 cells and this activity is significantly inhibited by BMS-387032. Moreover, CDK2 inhibition blocks IL-1β-induced binding to the NF-IL6 element of the COX-2 promoter and inhibits transcription of the COX-2 gene. We also observed that BMS-387032 does not inhibit endogenous expression of COX-2 or prostaglandin synthesis in lung carcinoma cells. Finally, we provide evidence showing that IL-1β-induced signaling events, such as p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphorylated stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, phosphorylated AKT, and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, are not inhibited by CDK2 inhibitor. Taken together, the data suggest that CDK2 activity may play an important event in the IL-1β-induced COX-2 expression and prostaglandin E2 synthesis and might represent a novel target for BMS-387032.

In this study, we used 3MC and 3,3′,4,4′,5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB) as prototypical AhR ligands, and both compounds activated estrogen-responsive reporter genes/gene products (cathepsin D) in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The estrogenic responses induced by these AhR ligands were inhibited by the antiestrogen ICI 182780 and by the transfection of a small inhibitory RNA for ERα but were not affected by the small inhibitory RNA for AhR. These results suggest that 3MC and PCB directly activate ERα, and this was confirmed in a competitive ERα binding assay and in a fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiment in which PCB and 3MC induced CFP-ERα/YFP-ERα interactions. In a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, PCB and 3MC enhanced ERα (but not AhR) association with the estrogen-responsive region of the pS2 gene promoter. Moreover, in AhR knockout mice, 3MC increased uterine weights and induced expression of cyclin D1 mRNA levels. These results show that PCB and 3MC directly activate ERα-dependent transactivation and extend the number of ligands that activate both AhR and ERα.

The SCoV 5′UTR was predicted to contain a fourth stem-loop, named SL3, in which the leader transcriptional regulatory sequence (TRS) is folded into a hairpin loop. cDNAs corresponding to MHV/SCoV chimeric genomes were constructed by replacing the complete MHV 5′UTR with the corresponding SCoV sequence and by separately replacing MHV 5′UTR putative SL1, putative SL2, TRS, and putative SL4 with the corresponding SCoV sequences. Chimeric genomes were transcribed in vitro, and viruses were recovered after electroporation into permissive cells. Genomes in which the MHV 5′UTR SL1, SL2, and SL4 were individually replaced by their SCoV counterparts were viable. Chimeras containing the complete SCoV 5′UTR or the predicted SCoV SL3 were not viable. A chimera containing the SCoV 5′UTR in which the SCoV TRS was replaced with the MHV TRS was also not viable. The chimera containing the entire SCoV 5′UTR failed to direct the synthesis of any virus-specific RNA. Replacing the SCoV TRS with the MHV TRS in the MHV/5′UTR SCoV chimera permitted the synthesis of minus-sense genome-sized RNA but did not support the production of positive- or minus-sense subgenomic RNA7. A similar phenotype was obtained with the MHV/SCoV SL3 chimera. These results suggest a role for the TRS in the replication of minus-sense genomic RNA in addition to its known function in subgenomic RNA synthesis.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.00455-06",""

We find that HMBA activation of viral expression is Tat independent but, like Tat, increases the efficiency of elongation of the HIV-1 promoter (long terminal repeat [LTR]) transcripts. Further, exposure to HMBA induces chromatin remodeling at nucleosome 1 (Nuc-1) near the start site of LTR transcription but does so without increasing histone acetylation or altering histone methylation near Nuc-1. Of note, despite enhanced proviral expression, HMBA suppressed HIV infection ex vivo in primary blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures. Treatment with HMBA did not alter expression of the HIV coreceptors, CCR5 and CXCR4, in PBMCs but down-regulated CD4. Finally, HMBA interferes with cell proliferation and activation; it suppressed expression of Ki67 and CD25 and in PBMCs exposed to mitogen. As HMBA has been tested in oncology trials, its unusual properties make it a useful reagent for future studies of HIV promoter regulation and a novel prototype molecule for therapeutics that abort the latent proviral state of chronic HIV infection.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.80.9.4570-4579.2006",""

DOC-2/DAB2 modulates mitogen-elicited mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction by sequestering several adaptor or effector molecules, such as growth factor receptor bound protein 2 and c-Src. We have shown that the proline-rich sequence in DOC-2/DAB2 is the key functional domain for this action. In this study, we further synthesized peptide based on the functional proline-rich domain and examined its biological function in prostate cancer using cell-permeable peptide (CPP) as a delivery system. From screening of several CPPs in prostate cancer cell lines, a polyarginine peptide (R11) seemed to be the best delivery vehicle because of its highly efficient uptake. In addition, we also observed a similar in vitro half-life and cellular location of R11 in four different prostate cancer cell lines. By conjugating a proline-rich sequence (PPL) or control sequence (AAL) derived from DOC-2/DAB2 to the COOH terminus of R11, we showed that R11PPL but not R11 or R11AAL was able to suppress either serum- or androgen-induced cell proliferation in prostate cancer cells without endogenous DOC-2/DAB2 expression. Consistently, the activation status of MAPK elicited by these mitogens was significantly inhibited by R11PPL but not by R11AAL or R11. Taken together, we conclude that a functional peptide derived from proline-rich domain in DOC-2/DAB2 has growth-inhibitory activity as its native protein, and CPP seems to be an efficient delivery system in prostate cancer cells.

The best-studied example is the Bcr-Abl fusion protein in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Although the clinical success of the Abl kinase inhibitor imatinib against chronic-phase CML emphasizes the importance of developing therapeutic strategies aimed at this target, resistance to imatinib poses a major problem for the ultimate success of CML therapy by this agent. We hypothesized a sequential blockade strategy that is designed to decrease the expression of the Bcr-Abl protein, with the goal of complementing the action of imatinib on kinase activity. In this study, flavopiridol, an inhibitor of transcription, homoharringtonine (HHT), a protein synthesis inhibitor, and imatinib were used singly and in combination against the Bcr-Abl-positive human CML cell line K562. Flavopiridol alone inhibited phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II COOH-terminal domain, specifically reduced RNA polymerase II–directed mRNA synthesis, and decreased the Bcr-Abl transcript levels. HHT inhibited protein synthesis and reduced the Bcr-Abl protein level. Imatinib directly inhibited the kinase activity of Bcr-Abl. The combinations of flavopiridol and HHT and flavopiridol and imatinib synergistically decreased clonogenicity as evaluated by the median-effect method. Greater synergy was observed when HHT and imatinib were given sequentially compared with simultaneous administration. Imatinib-resistant Ba/F3 cells that were transfected to express the E255K and T315I mutations of Bcr-Abl were not cross-resistant to flavopiridol and HHT. These results provided a rationale for the combination of inhibitors of transcription and/or translation with specific kinase inhibitors.

The helium metastables in the plasma break the C–H bonds in acetylene, causing molecular dissociation.

Matched field inversions using simulated annealing were performed with a ray trace plus complex plane wave reflection coefficient forward propagation model that was validated in previous work. Isolating bottom interacting paths to perform the inversions is shown to be essential to reduce parameter uncertainties in the hard bottom environment and enables a systematic approach to the inversions which establishes the number of layers needed to represent the lake environment. Measured transmission loss data from a towed source were compared through a RMS error analysis to modeled transmission loss, constructed with the parameters from inversions of data from several source types, to further establish the validity of the inversion approach for this environment. Geoacoustic parameters obtained by inversions of short range, low frequency impulsive data are used to predict transmission loss at longer ranges and higher frequencies. The range dependence of the global minimum is discussed.","https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article-pdf/120/6/3607/15281631/3607_1_online.pdf",""

However, its mechanism of action is not clear because high doses were used for in vitro studies to obtain antitumor effects. We found that celecoxib inhibited the growth of premalignant and malignant human bronchial epithelial cells with IC50 values between 8.9 and 32.7 μmol/L, irrespective of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. Normal human bronchial epithelial cells were less sensitive to celecoxib. Because these concentrations were higher than those attainable in vivo (≤5.6 μmol/L), we surmised that combining celecoxib with the synthetic retinoid N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide (4HPR) might improve its efficacy. Treatment of premalignant lung cell lines with combinations of clinically relevant concentrations of celecoxib (≤5 μmol/L) and 4HPR (≤0.25 μmol/L) resulted in greater growth inhibition, apoptosis induction, and suppression of colony formation than did either agent alone. This combination also decreased the levels of Bcl-2, induced the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, activated caspase-9 and caspase-3, and induced cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase at concentrations at which each agent alone showed no or minimal effects. Furthermore, combinations of celecoxib and 4HPR suppressed the phosphorylation levels of serine/threonine kinase Akt and its substrate glycogen synthase kinase-3β more effectively than the single agents did. Accordingly, overexpression of constitutively active Akt protected bronchial epithelial cells from undergoing apoptosis after incubation with both celecoxib and 4HPR. These findings indicate that activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and suppression of the Akt survival pathway mediate the augmented apoptosis and suggest that this combination may be useful for lung cancer chemoprevention.

The total vertical movement (including both swelling and shrinking) at the edge of pavement sections, the geometry of the pavement, site conditions, traffic, and the level of reliability were used as model parameters. Total movements calculated at the edge of pavement sections were based on a relationship between moisture content and suction, exponential suction envelopes, volume change coefficients, pavement treatments, and roadside conditions. Pavement treatments included vertical and horizontal barriers, inert soil, and lime-stabilized or cement-stabilized layers. The movements in wheelpaths at a distance from the edge of pavement were estimated on the basis of both field observations and the computed results of a transient finite element analysis.

Most highway work zones are restricted in regard to available lateral space for accommodating traffic and the work activity. Consequently, it is desirable to minimize deflection of work zone barriers to minimize the required buffer distance between the barrier and work activity area and, thereby, maximize the space and number of lanes available for traffic. Under this study, a new connection designed to reduce dynamic deflection of portable concrete traffic barriers was developed through a program of finite element simulation and full-scale crash testing. The new cross-bolted (or X-bolt) connection uses two threaded rods in different horizontal planes across the barrier joint to form a tight, moment connection. It achieves the objective of low dynamic barrier design deflection without sacrificing constructability. In addition to being easy to install, the new barrier system is also perceived to be easy to inspect and repair. Crashworthiness and design deflection of the barrier connection were verified through full-scale crash testing using segment lengths of 10 ft and 30 ft. An F-shape barrier with X-bolt connection was demonstrated to have the lowest deflection of any approved portable concrete barrier.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0361198106198400105",""

These observations suggest that the coupling between the magnetic orders and the dielectric properties is mediated by the lattice distortion. In particular, a possible scenario as to how ferroelectricity arises and subsequently is altered as a result of the subtle changes in the highly frustrated magnetic order, is discussed in the light of the strong spin-lattice coupling observed in these materials.

The evolutionary solutions to these problems reveal common themes. However, depending on differences in their organization, ploidy, and copy number, chromosomes and plasmids display distinct segregation strategies as well. In bacteria, chromosome duplication, likely mediated by a stationary replication factory, is accompanied by rapid, directed migration of the daughter duplexes with assistance from DNA-compacting and perhaps translocating proteins. The segregation of unit-copy or low-copy bacterial plasmids is also regulated spatially and temporally by their respective partitioning systems. Eukaryotic chromosomes utilize variations of a basic pairing and unpairing mechanism for faithful segregation during mitosis and meiosis. Rather surprisingly, the yeast plasmid 2-micron circle also resorts to a similar scheme for equal partitioning during mitosis.","https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.biochem.75.101304.124037",""

This description provides a baseline of strategies to investigate the effect of this program in developing sustainable communities. The builder study population was derived from a database of registered “green” residences built during 1998-2002 in greater Austin, Texas (2,335 homes and 73 listed builders). Almost half the builders constructed just one “green” home, whereas two builders built almost 75% of the green homes during the 5-year study period. Less than 1% of the homes received a perfect 5-star rating, whereas 87% were rated 1 or 2 stars. The frequency of implementing the 122 green features were compared over time and analyzed for correlation with cost and their associated star-value. Cost was the primary factor determining item use frequency. Participating builders generally concurred that the program was successful and beneficial to homeowners but that the additional work required for participation provided little financial reward for builders. While much can be done with low-cost interventions to reduce the negative environmental impacts of residential construction, builder participation may be enhanced by promotion of some of the higher cost features. In addition, public education about the long-term benefits of green homes is needed to increase homeowner participation, and encourage builders to incorporate more environmentally friendly features in the homes they construct.","",""

Impairment in signaling mechanisms that regulate differentiation of neurons is hypothesized to be one of the main causes of neuronal dysfunction. Retinoic acid, a physiologically active retinoid synthesized from vitamin A, regulates neuronal differentiation during embryonic development and is required for maintenance of plasticity in differentiated neurons. To date, little is known about the molecular events underlying hyperglycemia-induced complications in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we provide evidence, in a diabetes rat model, of hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress along with apoptotic stress in developing cortical neurons isolated from 16-day-old rat embryos. We also demonstrate impaired retinoic acid signaling that is involved in neuronal differentiation. Retinoic acid–induced neurite outgrowth and expression of neuronal markers were reduced in this model. The activation of small–molecular weight G-protein, Rac1, that mediates these effects was also reduced. Retinoic acid applied at a physiological concentration significantly decreased hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress and thus supported the antioxidant defense system. These results suggest that diabetes-induced neuronal complications during pregnancy might be due to impaired retinoic acid signaling, and exogenously administered retinoic acid may be useful against CNS complications associated with diabetes.","https://journals.org/diabetes/diabetes/article-pdf/55/12/3326/383833/zdb01206003326.pdf",""

The measurements are performed with the vorticity probe (VP), a probe that directly measures the plasma vorticity associated with the E×B shear flow by means of a method that is both simpler and more accurate than the methods used in neutral fluids. Because the rate of change of vorticity is a key quantity in nonlinear models, as in the Hasegawa-Mima equation, its direct measurement is critical for verification purposes. The physical origin of the rate of change of plasma vorticity from E×B flow is the divergence of the ion polarization current. Vortex coherent structures occur when the vorticity is a nonlinear function of the stream function. Statistical properties of vorticity are reported and shown to be consistent with the types of coherent structures created by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. Comparisons of the measured vortex characteristics with the results from nonlinear simulations of the systems is described.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pop/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.2179423/15802346/055701_1_online.pdf",""

We derive a general analytic model of reinforcement to study the effects of sex linkage on reinforcement under three forms of selection against hybrids: one-locus, two-locus, and ecological incompatibilities. We show that the pattern of sex linkage can have a large effect on the amount of reinforcement due to hybrid incompatibility. Sex linkage of genes involved in postzygotic isolation generally increases the strength of reinforcement, but only if genes involved in prezygotic isolation are also sex linked. We use exact simulations to test the accuracy of the approximation and find that qualitative predictions made assuming weak selection can hold when selection is strong. Our simulations also show that incompatibilities that evolve in allopatry by drift or weak selection are likely to be lost by swamping during secondary contact, even when selection against hybrids is strong.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/173/2/1145/42065582/genetics1145.pdf",""

This suggests that process-induced defects, which are the most probable cause for early failures, are significantly reduced for the barrier-first process. Transmission electron microscopy observation demonstrated a more uniform and thicker Ta barrier for the barrier-first process than the preclean-first process. This led to a higher (jL)c product, and prolonged the EM lifetime accordingly. In addition, a predeposited Ta barrier during the barrier-first process protected the mechanically weak low-k dielectrics from plasma etch damage, and a uniform via profile resulted. In contrast, the via opening at the top was found to be larger than that of at the via bottom for the preclean process.

Would organizations benefit from structural changes during crises? From a neo-information processing perspective that views organizations as composed of cognitively restricted, socially situated, and task-oriented actors, we argue that the causes and consequences of crises may be better understood through the systematic examination of both environmental and organizational factors. We address our research questions using a rather unique approach: a matched analysis of 80 real organizational cases and 80 computer-simulated organizations. The findings show that a crisis can present critical challenges to organizational performance both externally and internally, and that there is no design guarantee that a high-performing organization will continue to perform well during a crisis situation. In addition, when organizations restructure to adapt to crisis situations, they often face the serious challenges of having to understand not only the external environment, but also organizational design traps.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/orsc.1060.0210",""

The presence of anisotropy in the hydrate bearing sediments adds an additional complexity in data analysis; however anisotropy can help reveal the distribution of hydrates. Here we report on the evidence of seismic anisotropy at Hydrate Ridge along the Cascadia convergent margin. We find that the south summit is anisotropic, while the basin side (east of south summit) is isotropic. Anisotropy is likely caused by the hydrate veins. We interpret the anisotropy parameters in terms of the distribution and fabric of gas hydrates.","http://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2005GL023945",""

Results from field testing indicate that devices with the ability to display drivers’ speeds have considerable potential for reducing speeds and improving compliance. Orange borders greatly improve the visibility and conspicuity of speed limit signs, but they do not have a consistent measurable effect on compliance.

However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate PTHrP production by breast cancer cells are not entirely clear. We hypothesized that Gli2, a downstream transcriptional effector of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, regulates PTHrP expression in metastatic breast cancer because the Hh pathway regulates physiologic PTHrP expression in the developing growth plate. Here, we show that Gli2 is expressed in several human cancer cell lines that cause osteolytic lesions in vivo and produce PTHrP (MDA-MB-231, RWGT2, and PC-3) but is not expressed in nonosteolytic cancer cell lines that do not secrete PTHrP (MCF-7, ZR-75, and T47D). Transient expression of Gli2 in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells increased PTHrP promoter-luciferase activity dose dependently. Stable expression of Gli2 in MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in an increase in PTHrP protein in the conditioned medium. Alternatively, MDA-MB-231 cells stably transfected with Gli2-EnR, a repressor of Gli2 activity, exhibited a 72% to 93% decrease in PTHrP mRNA by quantitative real-time PCR when compared with control cells. To examine the effects of Gli2 on breast cancer–mediated osteolysis in vivo, athymic nude mice were inoculated with MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing Gli2 or the empty vector. Following tumor cell inoculation via the left cardiac ventricle, Gli2-expressing tumors caused significantly more osteolysis. Together, these data suggest that PTHrP expression and osteolysis in vivo in human breast cancer cells is driven at least in part by Gli2.

Medication-related problems were identified that could be addressed with pharmacist MTM. MTM design should include elements of pharmacotherapy effectiveness and program quality. Important considerations for reimbursement are the priorities of health care organizational stakeholders, promotion of the nondispensing role of pharmacists, capacity to integrate the workflow processes and billing codes of pharmacists and other health professionals, and newly emerging trends and service demands in health care.

The platform has a labyrinth-like seal upstream of the blades to model a realistic stator-rotor seal configuration. Additional coolant is supplied to the downstream half of the platform via discrete film cooling holes. The coolant flow rate through the upstream seal varies from 0.5% to 2.0% of the mainstream flow, while the blowing ratio of the coolant through the discrete holes varies from 0.5 to 2.0 (based on the mainstream velocity at the exit of the cascade). Detailed film cooling effectiveness distributions are obtained using the pressure sensitive paint (PSP) technique under a wide range of coolant flow conditions and various freestream turbulence levels (0.75% or 13.4%). The PSP technique clearly shows how adversely the coolant is affected by the passage induced flow.

The motors in the robotic hand could be replaced with novel electro-active polymer (EAP) actuators. In the three-finger gripper proposed in this paper, each finger can be actuated individually so that dexterous handling is possible, allowing precise manipulation. To develop model-based control laws, an approximated linear model representing the electromechanical behaviour of the gripper fingers is introduced. Several chirp voltage signal inputs were applied to excite the IPMC (ionic polymer metal composite) actuators in the interesting frequency range of (0.62 Hz, 5 Hz) for 30 s at a sampling frequency of 250 Hz. The linear Box-Jenkins (BJ) model was well matched with the model obtained using a stochastic power spectral method. With feedback control, the large overshoot, rise time, and settling time associated with the inherent material properties were reduced. The motions of the IPMC fingers in the microgripper would be coordinated to pick, move, and release a macro- or micro-part.

Hypothesis: Quadriceps strength and outcome measures improve after arthroscopic release of the vastus lateralis tendon in patients with documented patellar dislocation. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Twenty patients who had recurrent patellar dislocation underwent arthroscopic lateral retinacular release that included a complete release of the vastus lateralis tendon from the superior pole of the patella and were observed prospectively. Bilateral quadriceps strength was tested preoperatively and at follow-up with an isokinetic dynamometer. Patients also completed the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form and the Short Form-36 preoperatively and postoperatively. Results: Follow-up averaged 27 months (range, 24-43 months). There were no redislocations. Mean quadriceps strength improved by a mean of 28% (from 32.3 to 41.4 N·m). The mean quadriceps torque ratio (involved/uninvolved) improved significantly from a preoperative value of 63% (31/51 N·m) to 80% (42/52 N·m) at follow-up (P = .017). Fourteen patients (70%) increased quadriceps torque, and 6 patients (30%) decreased quadriceps torque.

However, the demagnetization effect and the resulting sample shape-dependent difference between the applied field and the internal field makes measurements of MSMAs properties difficult to interpret. Since for non-ellipsoidal specimen the internal magnetic field and thus the induced magnetization is nonuniform, standard demagnetization factors can not be applied without evaluation of the expected error. Following up on previous work by the authors this paper describes a methodology by which experimental data can be interpreted more accurately. The procedure involves the numerical solving of nonlinear magnetostatic boundary value problems for MSMAs in which the stress-dependent magnetic properties of the material are predicted by the constitutive model. New results of this analysis presented here include a parametric study of the sample shape dependence of the demagnetization effect when accounting for the nonlinear magnetization properties of MSMAs.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2006-15296/2659599/311_1.pdf",""

Also, in order to minimize foot prints, the recent trend in packaging is stacking. The stacking, however, creates challenges in cooling and especially if one is to include logic in the stack. The primary heat flow path for stacking is through the substrate and as the number of stacks increase, the cooling problem is amplified. Thermal vias are emerging as a viable technology for transferring heat and in effect creating a thermal short circuit from individual die to the substrate. Some of the authors of this paper earlier reported on the reliability of stacked memory dies. In a subsequent paper the thermal reliability that included geometrical stacking architecture (rotating, spacer, ..) and the inclusion of both logic and memory dies was addressed. In this present paper, the heat transfer enhancement using silicon vias on various stacking schemes is discussed. The CAD models required for this study were developed in Pro/Engineer® Wildfire™ 2.0 and for the result simulation ANSYS® Workbench™ 10.0 have been used. Packaging architectures that have been taken in to consideration are die, solder ball, substrate, mold cap and thermal vias.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2006-15352/4572943/287_1.pdf",""

Recently, these compounds have also been shown to suppress tumor development in several animal models. The molecular basis for their antitumor action, however, is largely unknown. We report here that oral administration of thiazolidinediones (rosiglitazone and troglitazone) remarkably inhibited insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)–promoted skin tumor development by 73% in BK5.IGF-1 transgenic mice, although they were previously found to be ineffective in inhibiting UV- or chemically induced mouse skin tumorigenesis. The anti-IGF-I effect of troglitazone in mouse skin keratinocytes was due to, at least partially, inhibition of IGF-I–induced phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase (p70S6K) at Thr389, a site specifically phosphorylated by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Troglitazone did not directly inhibit mTOR kinase activity as shown by mTOR in vitro kinase assay but rapidly activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) through a yet undefined peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ–independent mechanism. Expression of a dominant-negative AMPK reversed the inhibitory effect of troglitazone on IGF-I–induced phosphorylation of p70S6K, suggesting that troglitazone inhibited IGF-I and p70S6K signaling through activation of AMPK. Collectively, these data suggest that thiazolidinediones specifically inhibit IGF-I tumor-promoting activity in mouse skin through activation of AMPK and subsequent inhibition of p70S6K.

Most migration-based velocity analysis algorithms need spatial coordinates of reflection points and CIG depth residuals at different offsets (or angles) to provide updated velocity information. We propose a new algorithm that can analyze 3D velocity quickly and accurately. Spatial coordinates and orientations of reflection points are provided by a 3D prestack parsimonious depth migration; the migration involves only the time samples picked from the salient reflection events on one 3D common-offset volume. Ray tracing from the reflection points to the surface provides a common-reflection-point (CRP) gather for each reflection point. Predicted (nonhyperbolic) moveouts for local velocity perturbations, based on maximizing the stacked amplitude, give the estimated velocity updates for each CRP gather. Then the velocity update for each voxel in the velocity model is obtained by averaging over all predicted velocity updates for that voxel. Prior model constraints may be used to stabilize velocity updating. Compared with other migration velocity analyses, the traveltime picking is limited to only one common-offset volume (and needs to be done only once); there is no need for intensive 3D prestack depth migration. Hence, the computation time is orders of magnitude less than other migration-based velocity analyses. A 3D synthetic data test shows the algorithm works effectively and efficiently.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/1.2227523",""

In this work, we propose a new generation of sensors and actuators based on a piezoelectric polymer (PVDF) with embedded carbon nanotubes. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)-double walled carbon-nanotubes (DWNT) composite films are prepared with the goal to develop new polymeric materials with enhanced electrical and electromechanical properties. Electrical conductivity and dielectric properties of polyvinylidene fluoride- double-walled carbon nanotubes composites are investigated as a function of frequency (10 Hz–1 MHz), and as a function of weight fraction (0.01–2 wt%). DWNT and PVDF are mixed under mechanical stirring and sonication. The dispersion is assessed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), indicating a good dispersion. Differential Scanning Calorimetery (DSC) is used to study the effect of DWNTs inclusions on the glass transition temperature, Tg, and the crystallinity of the resulting PVDF composite. The percolation threshold is computed by using the bulk conductivity data and it is found that percolation occurs at about 0.19wt%. These investigations promise to increase our understanding of the mechanisms involved, particularly as related to nanoparticle/polymer interaction. This in turn would allow us to tailor the polymer nanocomposites to yield desired performance in terms of actuation voltage, electroactive strain, blocking stress and response time to name a few.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/MN/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/MN2006-17057/4569802/267_1.pdf",""

The composite microstructures are simplified with uniformly distributed cubic particles over an infinite medium. The representative volume element (RVE) consists of a single particle embedded in the cubic matrix. One eighth unit-cell model with four particle and polymer subcells is generated. The solid spherical particle is modeled as linear elastic, while the polymer follows nonlinear viscoelastic material responses. The homogenized micromechanical relation is developed in terms of the average strains and stresses and satisfies traction continuity and displacement compatibility at the subcells' interfaces. The micromechanical model provides three-dimensional (3D) effective properties of homogeneous materials, while recognizing important micro-structural aspects and parameters of the heterogeneous medium. The micromechanical formulation is generalized to include an explicit time-scale for modeling time-dependent behavior and is designed to be compatible with general displacement based finite element (FE) analyses. Due to the nonlinear and time-dependent response in the polymeric matrix, the linearized micromechanical relations will often deviate from the nonlinear constitutive equations. Thus, the stress-strain correction scheme is formulated to satisfy both micromechanical and nonlinear constitutive relations. Experimental data and analytical models available in the literature are used to verify the capability of the above micromechanical model in predicting the overall nonlinear behaviors. Comparisons with detail unit-cell FE model are also presented.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2006-13598/4525563/513_1.pdf",""

Despite the preferential association of K4-trimethylated H3 with regions of the genome that are transcribed by RNA polymerase II, transcriptional silencing is one of the few cases in S. cerevisiae where histone-methylation defects have a clear effect on gene expression. To better understand the role of COMPASS in transcriptional silencing, we have determined which members of COMPASS are required for silencing at the ribosomal DNA locus (rDNA), a telomere, and the silent mating loci (HM) using Northern analyses. Our findings indicate that most members of COMPASS are required for silencing at the rDNA and telomere, while none are required for silencing of endogenous genes at the HM loci. To complement gene-expression analysis, quantitative Western blot experiments were performed to determine the members of COMPASS that are required for methylation of histone H3. While most are required for trimethylation, cells lacking certain COMPASS proteins maintain reduced levels of K4 mono- and dimethylated H3, suggesting that some COMPASS members have redundant function. Finally, we show Paf1 is required for silencing and K4-methylated H3 at the rDNA, suggesting a possible direct role for K4-methylated H3 in gene silencing.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/173/2/557/42067453/genetics0557.pdf",""

To begin to understand the virus-host interactions that may influence the phenotypic properties of divergent lineage I and II viruses, we compared the genetic, pathogenic, and alpha/beta interferon (IFN-α/β)-regulatory properties of a lineage II isolate from Madagascar (MAD78) with those of a new lineage I isolate from Texas (TX02). Full genome sequence analysis revealed that MAD78 clustered, albeit distantly, with other lineage II strains, while TX02 clustered with emergent North American isolates, more specifically with other Texas strains. Compared to TX02, MAD78 replicated at low levels in cultured human cells, was highly sensitive to the antiviral actions of IFN in vitro, and demonstrated a completely avirulent phenotype in wild-type mice. In contrast to TX02 and other pathogenic forms of WNV, MAD78 was defective in its ability to disrupt IFN-induced JAK-STAT signaling, including the activation of Tyk2 and downstream phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2. However, replication of MAD78 was rescued in cells with a nonfunctional IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR). Consistent with this finding, the virulence of MAD78 was unmasked upon infection of mice lacking IFNAR. Thus, control of the innate host response and IFN actions is a key feature of WNV pathogenesis and replication fitness.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.00768-06",""

In this study, the efficacy of L-arginine in enhancing intestinal absorption of ardeparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) was investigated in Caco-2 cell monolayers and a rat model. Regional permeability studies using rat intestine were performed using a modified Ussing chamber. Cell viability in the presence of various concentrations of enhancer was determined by MTT assay. Furthermore, the eventual mucosal epithelial damage was histologically evaluated. LMWH formulated with L-arginine was administered orally to male Sprague-Dawley rats and the absorption of LMWH was determined by measuring plasma anti-factor Xa activity. Higher ardeparin in-vitro permeability (∼3 fold) compared with control was observed in the presence of 2% L-arginine. Regional permeability studies indicated predominant absorption in the colon region. Cell viability studies showed no significant cytotoxicity below 0.8% L-arginine. The oral bioavailability of ardeparin formulated with L-arginine (250 mg kg−1) was increased by ∼2 fold compared with control. The formulation was well tolerated by the rats and no abnormal histopathological findings were observed in intestinal tissues of rats exposed to L-arginine. These results suggest that L-arginine may be useful in enhancing the intestinal absorption of LMWHs.","http://academic.oup.com/jpp/article-pdf/58/5/591/36736576/jpp.58.5.0003.pdf",""

The PPARγ-active C-DIMs have not previously been studied against bladder cancer. We investigated the effects of the PPARγ-active C-DIMs on bladder cancer cells in vitro and bladder tumors in vivo. In this study, the PPARγ-active compounds inhibited the proliferation of KU7 and 253J-BV bladder cancer cells, and the corresponding IC50 values were 5 to 10 and 1 to 5 μmol/L, respectively. In the less responsive KU7 cells, the PPARγ agonists induced caveolin-1 and p21 expression but no changes in cyclin D1 or p27; in 253J-BV cells, the PPARγ agonists did not affect caveolin-1, cyclin D1, or p27 expression but induced p21 protein. In KU7 cells, induction of caveolin-1 by each of the PPARγ agonists was significantly down-regulated after cotreatment with the PPARγ antagonist GW9662. DIM-C-pPhCF3 (60 mg/kg thrice a week for 4 weeks) inhibited the growth of implanted KU7 orthotopic and s.c. tumors by 32% and 60%, respectively, and produced a corresponding decrease in proliferation index. Treatment of KU7 cells with DIM-C-pPhCF3 also elevated caveolin-1 expression by 25% to 30%, suggesting a role for this protein in mediating the antitumorigenic activity of DIM-C-pPhCF3 in bladder cancer.
