Recently, these parasites have exhibited increasing resistance towards these drugs. Haemonchus controtus, a gastrointestinal nematode commonly found in small ruminants, has developed resistance towards multiple classes of anthelmintics, leading to huge economic losses worldwide. There are few novel drugs currently being developed, but certain plant-derived products have demonstrated anthelmintic properties when administered in various forms to ruminants. By utilizing these plant products, producers have the opportunity to decrease the rate of development of anthelmintic resistance, and prevent eggs from hatching when excreted by infected livestock. Therefore, it is hypothesized that specific plant-derived products will act as ovicidal agents in H. contortus eggs. The objective of this study was to determine the ovicidal activity of allicin (from Allium sativum) and pumpkin seed oil (PSO). H. contortus eggs were extracted from a pooled fecal sample of Boer and Spanish goats naturally infected with H. contortus. The eggs were then exposed to allicin or PSO at different concentrations. Experiments were replicated four times per concentration. To determine ovicidal activity, samples were observed for unhatched eggs and hatched worms for 24 hours. The 1:100 allicin dilution treatment tended (P = 0.053) to inhibit hatching more than the control. Furthermore, any worms that hatched in allicin treatments exhibited limited signs of motility. Pumpkin seed oil does not appear to possess the same ovicidal potency as allicin, but may still have potential as a larvicidal agent. Based on the current results, allicin is a potential ovicidal agent that may be used independently or incorporated with current treatment methods for H. contortus control.","http://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/97/Supplement_3/217/31255208/skz258.446.pdf",""

In small ruminants, Haemonchus contortus contributes to substantial economic losses in weight gain and mortality. Historical pharmaceutical control of H. contortus resulted in anthelmintic resistance, further exacerbating economic losses. The rise of anthelmintic resistance precipitated the need to investigate alternative treatments. One promising area is using anthelmintically active plant extracts. It is hypothesized that substances extracted from pumpkin seeds, garlic, and wormwood will demonstrate anthelmintic activity against H. contortus. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of three plant extracts on adult H. contortus mortality in vitro. Pumpkin seed oil (extracted from Cucurbita maxima), allicin (extracted from Allium sativum), and artemisinin (extracted from Artemisia absinthium) were selected as viable alternatives and evaluated for anthelmintic activity. Live adult H. contortus nematodes were extracted from the abomasum of sheep and goats collected from a local abattoir and placed in triplicate into 6-well plates containing differing concentrations of treatments. Fenbendazole was utilized as a positive control and physiological saline as a negative control. Anthelmintic efficacy was determined via time-to-death observation. Time-to-death was determined hourly by observation of movement for thirty seconds. Absence of movement for thirty seconds indicated death. Time-to-death was evaluated via ANOVA. Allicin exhibited a time-to-death similar to fenbendazole (2.15 ± 0.58 h vs. 1.00 ± 0.58 h, P = 0.15). Pumpkin seed oil exhibited accelerated time-to-death compared to negative control (4.15 ± 0.73 h vs. 10.00 ± 0.73 h, P &lt; 0.01). Artemisin did not affect time-to-death at the tested concentrations. Allicin and pumpkin seed oil demonstrated potential as alternative anthelmintics at the evaluated concentrations, providing a potential treatment for H. contortus.

The first 6 themes represent the values, beliefs, and norms of the participants, with the remaining 4 reflecting their personal identities, personalities, and experiences. The findings suggest that they continue to value families and religion, care about others, and make judgements about people, things, and circumstances that they face.

The current study aimed to identify specific social media behaviors related to Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). Methods: U.S adults (n = 1,314) aged 18 to 82 (M = 35.74) who actively use social media were recruited to participate in an online survey assessing specific social media behaviors. The Patient Health Questionnaire was included to assess the presence of GAD. Univariate analyses were conducted to identify specific social media behaviors associated with GAD. A stepwise binary multivariate logistic regression was developed to determine the key social media behaviors most strongly associated with GAD. Results: Analyses at the univariate level showed a trend, such that individuals with GAD endorsed behaviors associated with social media addiction and censorship. Other behaviors associated with GAD included a greater likelihood of participants comparing themselves to others who are better off than they are, being bothered if unfriended/unfollowed, and being more likely to post under the influence. The multivariate logistic regression model identified two key social media factors most strongly associated with GAD: participants comparing themselves to others better off (p < .001) and posting while drinking alcohol (p = .044).Conclusion: Upward social comparisons and alcohol use while on social media are significantly associated with GAD in an adult population.

Methods: Three hundred eighty-five individuals with hypothyroidism completed the Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI) and measures evaluating symptom severity and comorbid diagnoses. Results: Hypothyroid patients with high CSI scores (Severe and Extreme subscales) were more likely to report fibromyalgia, musculoskeletal pain, arthritis, and migraine, along with chronic fatigue syndrome, gastrointestinal problems, depression and anxiety disorders. The key symptoms related to CSS were depressive symptoms, fatigue, headaches, and aches/pains. The key comorbidities related to CSS were lower age, and depression and/or anxiety diagnoses. Conclusion: Hypothyroid patients reporting greater ratings of hypothyroid symptoms, particularly fatigue, aches/pains, and depression symptoms may be exhibiting central sensitization, and further testing for CSS conditions should be considered.

Ellipsometry is considered the most appropriate technique for fast and accurate thickness measurement for large scale production. However, a precise and well-calibrated model is a prerequisite for this technique. While ellipsometry of individual device layers has been reported in recent perovskite literature, a comprehensive multilayer modeling approach is thus far unavailable. Perovskite optoelectronic devices generally consist of a six-layer film stack with three transparent layers required for optical absorption in the perovskite layer. Spin casted thin films, now common in this line of research, impart their own difficulties into ellipsometric modeling. Roughnesses at each heterointerface, similarities in optical spectra of transparent layers, and anomalous dispersion of perovskite are just a few of such challenges. In this work, we report the process of building an ellipsometry model from scratch for thickness measurement of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI) perovskite and indium tin oxide (ITO)/hole transport layer (HTL) bilayer thin film stacks on a glass substrate. Three promising representatives of HTLs (CuI, Cu2O, and PEDOT:PSS) were studied. The models were extended to measure the individual layer thicknesses of the MAPI/HTL/ITO film stack on a glass substrate using the models developed for individual layers. Optical constants of all the representative thin films were thus extracted for a wide wavelength range (300 nm–900 nm).","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/adv/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.5125686/12929303/125107_1_online.pdf",""

If cyclic AMP were exported from the photoreceptors into the sub‐retinal space, it could then be available for uptake by the RPE, in which it could activate processes that drive pigment granule aggregation. We hypothesize that ABCC4 in photoreceptors mediates cAMP‐export and is needed for pigment granule migration in mice.

We recorded the talus trochlear mediolateral (TTML) breadth and femoral head diameter (FHD) for each modern human specimen, and obtained KNM‐ER 5428's TTML values from the literature. We developed regression formulae based on TTML using the body mass estimated from FHD for the entire human sample and for known body masses from a normal‐BMI subsample, and then used these formulae to calculate body mass for KNM‐ER 5428. In addition, we examined the range of body masses for individuals with TTML measurements comparable to KNM‐ER 5428. Results: The body masses of normal‐BMI individuals with a TTML ≥32.3 mm (the smaller of the two fossil measurements from the literature) ranged between 60.3 and 86.2 kg and averaged 72.3 kg. The body masses of normal‐BMI individuals with a TTML ≥33.7 mm (the larger measurement) ranged between 63.5 and 86.2 kg with a mean of 73.6 kg.

To investigate the association between baseline health in each domain and developmental change across domains, we estimated trajectories of working memory, mobility limitations, and comorbidity among US adults age 65 and older over 18 years. We drew observations from the nationally-representative Health and Retirement Study with an analytic sample consisting of 5,963 adults age 65 and over in 1998. Immediate word recall, an 11-item Nagi scale of mobility limitations, and a summary count of eight doctor-diagnosed chronic conditions were measured biennially from 1998 to 2016. Parallel-process quadratic growth models with individually-varying time scores were used to estimate non-linear trajectories of each health measure, allowing identification of associations between baseline health and developmental change in each health process at both earlier and later stages of older adulthood. All estimates adjusted for covariates, complex survey design, and missing data. Greater baseline immediate word recall was associated with less rapid increase in mobility limitations at earlier ages. More baseline mobility limitations were associated with faster increase in comorbidity at earlier ages. Greater baseline chronic conditions were associated with more rapid increase in mobility limitations at later ages. These results highlight the importance of conceptualizing health among older adults as an interdependent and developmental process and should help clinicians recognize that single-domain health status may influence the progression of other health outcomes at different stages of older adulthood.","http://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/3/Supplement_1/S659/33001178/igz038.2442.pdf",""

Several nutrients found in walnuts appear to play a neuro-protective role, yet few studies examine whole walnut consumption or draw from representative longitudinal samples. We draw observations from the nationally-representative Health and Retirement Study and Health Care and Nutrition Study to investigate the association between walnut consumption and cognitive trajectories among older US adults. The analytic sample consisted of 6,639 adults age 50 and over in 2013, representing a population of 77,726,682 community-dwelling older adults. Walnut consumption was a categorical measure representing no consumption, moderate consumption (&lt; one serving per week), or high consumption (≥ one serving per week). Indicators of cognitive function representing working memory (immediate and delayed word recall) and global cognitive function (Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status, TICS) were measured at 3 time points (2012, 2014, and 2016). Latent growth models were used to estimate each linear trajectory while adjusting for covariates and complex survey design. Walnut consumption was positively associated with word recall and global mental status at baseline, but was not associated with change over the four year observational window. For example, those with high walnut consumption had baseline TICS scores .89 units greater (SE = .17, p &lt; .001) than those consuming no walnuts. These results indicate that walnut consumption appears to have a positive association with cognitive health, but walnut consumption does not appear to be associated with short-term change in the cognitive outcomes measured.","http://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/3/Supplement_1/S659/33001068/igz038.2441.pdf",""

Recent efforts to improve nursing home quality are focused on providing person‐centered care and improving the resident experience. However, the literature on nursing home quality lacks the perspective and experiences of nursing assistants themselves, despite their crucial role in the resident experience. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 25 nursing assistants from 17 organizations and seven states. Data were analyzed using an interpretive approach that identified relevant codes and themes. Respondents perceived that they play a pivotal role in the resident experience by providing choices, communicating important information, comforting, and living within the daily reality of cognitively impaired residents. Nursing assistants' challenges included using non‐verbal communication, balancing personal care while maintaining boundaries, and dealing with a perceived lack of trust. Nursing assistants are integral to interpersonal engagement with residents and relationship‐based activities, such as communication, caring, and protecting. Increased nursing assistant input into programs and policies to improve the resident experience is warranted.

The Longissimus muscle was cored for tenderness. Two sources of loins were evaluated: Akaushi breed, and from a commercial grocery store. Meat used consisted of Akaushi loins from 6 different animals (prime grade) and one select grade loin (control). The protocol involved dividing each loin into 6 (907-1134g) roasts, cooking at 104.40 C (to internal temperature of 73.90 C), measuring by weight the cooking loss of the roasts after a 30-minute resting period, and determining tenderness by Warner-Bratzler Shear Force (WBSF) (after overnight storage in a cooler). Cores were taken at 6 different locations of the roast, over the same regional area for WBSF determinations. The WBSF coring instrument used was provided. Tenderness of each loin was measured in 36 cores (n = 36). In overall tenderness, the control loin ranked third out of the seven loins and had the least amount of cooking loss. No differences were found in tenderness (P > 0.05). However, a difference was found in average cooking loss 181.44g ± 0.03 (control); 254.01g ± 0.03 (Akaushi) (P < 0.05). When observing tenderness consistency, the control loin had a somewhat larger standard deviation (1.38 vs 0.756) than the Akaushi loins.Loins used in this study showed variation in cooking loss, tenderness, and consistency between a commercial grocery store source and the Akaushi beef source.

This study contributes to this knowledge base by centering the voices and experiences of four Latina school leaders in the United States. All of the school leaders were current or former school principals and/or assistant principals at the time of the study, with three being from Texas and one from California. Research Approach: Drawing on the methodological tenets of testimonio, this study asked: What are Latina school leaders’ professional experiences like, both positive and negative, given the intersectionality of their social identities? Utilizing intersectionality as a theoretical framework provided the means to analyze and understand Latina school leaders’ multiple social identities and the role that such identities played in their professional roles and career trajectories as school leaders within the larger context of educational politics and systemic inequities. Findings: Testimonios of participants centered on four themes related to how they confronted gender roles and expectations of motherhood, the criticality of mentorship, how they confronted and addressed racism and sexism, and harnessed bilingualism to empower self and others. Implications: Findings help inform those seeking to meet the needs of our growing Latinx student population, including school district administrators, current and upcoming school leaders, and those working to prepare a more diverse school leadership pipeline.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0013161X19866491",""

We examined parental nativity (foreign‐born mothers, fathers, and both parents combined compared to a referent of both U.S.‐born parents) and the number of years lived in the U.S. (≤5/6+ years). Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate crude/adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Results: Compared to U.S.‐born mothers, foreign‐born mothers tended to be older (25+ years), of Hispanic or Other race/ethnicity and were less likely to have reported drinking, smoking, illicit drug use, or having taken folic acid. In the adjusted analysis, seven findings among both parents reporting a foreign‐birth were significant, including an increased association with spina bifida, anotia/microtia, and diaphragmatic hernia (aORs range: 1.3–1.7), and a reduced association with craniosynostosis and gastroschisis (aORs = 0.7). A generally protective effect was observed among foreign‐born subjects living in the U.S. ≤5 years. Conclusions: We found that nativity was associated with some selected isolated defects, although the direction of effect varied by phenotype and by a number of years residing in the U.S.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fbdr2.1494",""

Other reviews have analyzed the relationship between CDSS, practitioner performance, and patient outcomes. These reviews reported positive practitioner performance in over half the articles analyzed, but very little information was found for patient outcomes. The purpose of this review was to analyze the relationship between CDSS, practitioner performance, and patient medical outcomes. PubMed, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases were queried.Methods 27 articles were chosen based on year published (last ten years), high quality source, and discussion of the relationship between the use of CDSS as an intervention and links to practitioner performance or patient outcomes. Reviewers used an Excel spreadsheet to collect information on the relationship between CDSS and practitioner performance or patient outcomes. Reviewers also collected observations of participants, intervention, comparison with control group, and outcomes (PICO) along with those showing implicit bias. Articles were analyzed by multiple reviewers following the Kruse Protocol for systematic reviews. Data were organized into multiple tables for analysis and reporting.Results Fourteen articles (52%) discussed positive practitioner performance, three articles (11%) found no difference in practitioner performance, ten articles (37%) did not discuss practitioner performance. Zero articles reported negative practitioner performance. Fifteen articles (56%) discussed positive patient medical outcomes, two articles (7%) found no statistically significant difference in medical outcomes between intervention and control groups, and ten articles (37%) did not discuss medical outcomes. Zero articles found negative patient medical outcomes.Conclusions Results of this review are commensurate with previous reviews with similar objectives, but unlike these reviews we found significant positive reporting of a positive effect on patient medical outcomes. Our findings support adoption of decision support systems.","https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-7528/v1",""

Yet extent information system (IS) curriculum lacks teaching resources on chatbots programming.. Background: To better prepare students for this new technological development and to enhance the IS curriculum, we introduce a project that teaches students how to program simple chatbots, including a transactional chatbot and a conversational chatbot. Methodology: We demonstrated a project that teaches students how to program two types of simple chatbots: a transactional chatbot and a conversational chatbot. We also conducted a survey to examine students’ perceptions on their learning experience. Findings: Our survey on students’ perception of the project finds that learning chatbots is deemed very useful because chatbot programming projects have enabled the students to understand the subject better. We also found that social influence has positively motivated the students to learn chatbot programming. Though most of the students have no prior experiences programming chatbots, their self-efficacy towards chatbot programming remained high after working through the programming project. Despite the difficult tasks, over 71% of respondents agree to various degrees that chatbot programming is fun. Though most students agree that chatbot programming is not easy to learn, more than 70% of respondents indicated that they will use or learn chatbots in the near future. The overwhelmingly positive responses are impressive given that this is the first time for the students to program and learn chatbots. Recommendations for Practitioners: In this article, we introduced a step by step project on teaching chatbot programming in an information systems class. Following the project instructions, students can get their first intelligent chatbots up and running in a few hours using Slack. This article describes the project in detail as well as students’ perceptions. Recommendations for Researchers: We used UTAUT model to measure students’ perception of the projects. This study could be of value to researchers studying students’ technology learning and adoption behaviors. Impact on Society: To our best knowledge, pedagogical resources that teach IS students how to program chatbots, especially the introductory level materials, are limited. We hope this teaching case could be of value for IS educators when introducing IS students to the wonderful field of chatbot programming. Future Research: For future work, we plan to expand the teaching resources to cover more advanced chatbot programming projects, such as on how to make chatbot more human-like.","http://iisit.org/Vol16/IISITv16p001-031Long5559.pdf",""

A total of 64 steers were enrolled in this study over 2 years (32 steers/year), with 4 phases per year: creep-feeding (d 0 to 60), pre-weaning (d 61 to 120), post-weaning (d 121 to 180) and feedlot (181 to slaughter). On d 0 steers were ranked by body weight (BW) and age (114 ± 2 kg; 66 ± 0.5 d) and randomly assigned, in a 2 x 2 factorial, to receive 80 g/steer daily (creep-feeding) or 150 g/steer daily (post-weaning) of CSSO. Non-supplemented steers (CON) were provided with equivalent saturated fat supplement. On d 0, 61, 120, 180, and 330 steers were evaluated for longissimus muscle depth, backfat thickness, and marbling via real time ultrasonography, blood was sampled for determination of plasma fatty acid composition, muscle samples were collected via needle biopsy, and BW was recorded. After the creep-feeding phase, CSSO steers had greater (P &lt; 0.01) plasma concentrations of linoleic, omega-6, and total PUFA compared with CON. Steers that received CSSO during the postweaning phase had greater (P &lt; 0.01) plasma concentrations of linoleic, omega·-6, and total FA compared with CON prior to feedlot entry. No treatment differences were detected for performance or body composition responses (P &gt; 0.25) during any phase. However, mRNA expression of adipogenic/lipogenic genes was greater (P &lt; 0.03) prior to slaughter (d 330) in muscle of steers that had received CSSO during the creep-feeding phase.

Seventy-two Angus × Hereford heifers weaned at 7 months of age were managed as a single group on pasture, and individually received supplements to achieve the desired average daily gain (ADG) until breeding (d 183). Accordingly, ADG was greater (P &lt; 0.01) in HGAIN vs. MGAIN and LGAIN (0.85, 0.65, and 0.40 kg/d, respectively), and greater (P &lt; 0.01) in MGAIN vs. LGAIN heifers.

No differences were detected for pregnancy and final calving rate between treatments (P &gt; 0.22), whereas HGAIN and MGAIN heifers were heavier (P = 0.05) at calving compared with LGAIN. Approximately 45 days after calving, milk production was estimated via weight-suckle-weight and milk samples collected from a subset of 10 heifers/treatment.

However, what this looks and sounds like in practice is not always clear, leaving schools seeking common ground on how to create a college-going environment. Purpose: Through a symbolic and ecological model of college readiness framework, the messaging associated with the college-going culture at three racially and economically diverse Texas high schools that had consistently high college ready graduate rates was examined. The research questions that guided the study included: What types of college-going culture messages are conveyed at the schools, and how? How might such messaging impact students, school staff and leaders? Research Design: This study drew on data from a three-year, multi-site descriptive case study of three public high schools in different regions of Texas that all served approximately 50% or more of students with financial need and 72% to 97% students of color, specifically Latina/o and Black students. Data Collection and Analysis: Data was collected during week-long, yearly visits to the three schools and included: school and district documents; individual and group semi-structured interviews with 194 individuals including administrators, teachers, support staff, students, parents, and community members; observations of common areas and classrooms; archival data; and researcher-derived documents including field notes, memos, and photographs of the school grounds and school activities. This paper primarily drew on the pictures taken of the schools (in hallways, classrooms, and shared spaces like cafeterias and libraries), field notes, memos, and interview data that specifically spoke to the visual and verbal messaging associated with the college-going culture. Analysis of data revealed six themes: college is a revered goal with many options; varying degrees of integration; support and resources are at your reach; think college and career; finding funding for college is vital; college is an individual and shared success. Conclusions: This study's findings suggest the need to: reconsider what a strong college-going culture entails, re-envision college-going cultures as dynamic, multi-layered, and responsive, reframe postsecondary opportunities so they are more expansive and varied, and re-evaluate inequities in college-going messaging and academic rigor.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/016146811912101103",""

Because the devices are grid-resident and interact directly with other devices on the same physical link, applications such as ML-assisted DVO can be targeted with very high confidence.","https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/9/14/2902/pdf",""

Users can spread information on Twitter either by crafting new posts, which are called “tweets,” or by using the retweet mechanism to re-post previously created tweets. During natural disasters, identifying how likely a tweet is to be retweeted is crucial since it can help promote the spread of useful information in a social network such as Twitter, as well as it can help stop the spread of misinformation when corroborated with approaches that identify rumors and misinformation. In this paper, we present an analysis of retweeted tweets from two different hurricane disasters, to identify factors that affect retweetability. We then use these factors to extract features from tweets' content and user account information in order to develop models that automatically predict the retweetability of a tweet.

There have been a limited number of sightings in only seven counties in northern Texas during the past 30 y. The apparent decline of the species has been attributed to habitat loss due to increasing conversion of natural areas into cropland. The magnitude and exact cause of the decline are difficult to determine because of insufficient data on the distribution of the species and its habitat within its relatively small geographic range. Habitat studies have focused on the microhabitat of burrows rather than a coarser-scale identification of habitat and its distribution within the species' historic range. Multiple species of Dipodomys have demonstrated strong associations with certain soil and land-cover types. Therefore our goal was to develop a range-wide map of potential habitat on the basis of the association of D. elator with specific soil and land-cover types. We used the map to guide roadside surveys and also updated the map with information on D. elator distribution obtained during the surveys. Over the course of two summers (2016 and 2017) we documented D. elator at 138 separate point locations in five counties. A geographic information system-based analysis of soil and land-cover data revealed that the species is associated with clay-loam and loam soils and mixed-grass/shortgrass prairie. We also found an unexpected association with cropland, although we do not know the exact extent to which D. elator actually uses cropland. The surveys provide an updated assessment of the species distribution and the maps of potential habitat indicate areas where the species may still exist.","http://meridian.allenpress.com/jfwm/article-pdf/10/2/619/2462308/122018-jfwm-113.pdf",""

The study used a pretest-posttest, quasi-experimental design and focus group interviews. Randomly selected 18 older-adult participants were paired with young-adult participants as an exercise buddy for each other to attend 8 weekly Tai Chi or Chair Yoga classes at a community center. Meanwhile, 16 older-adult participants formed a control group attending different exercise classes without young-adult buddies. The survey results show that, compared to the control group, the intervention group (n = 35) had significantly greater satisfaction with life (p &lt; .09 ) and a more positive attitude towards aging (p &lt; .01) after attending exercise classes with their buddies. In focus group interviews, the participants most frequently mentioned that commitment to their buddies as a key factor for class attendance.

Texas State University has taught a bachelor’s in health administration (BHA) and a master’s in health administration (MHA) for decades and recently wanted to validate its curriculum. Professors began with one course, the management of health information technology (HIT). We had two objectives with this work: What are the current health care information technology competencies required of health care administrators? Is the quality and depth of the current HIT curriculum sufficient? A competency-mapping exercise was used for the first question, and a survey mechanism was used for the second. Three demographic, 10 Likert-type-scale statements, and one free-text question were presented through an online survey instrument to stakeholders (alumni and preceptors). Stakeholders were asked about the importance, quality, and capabilities enabled by the HIT course. Nonparametric tests were used for analysis. The competency-mapping exercise highlighted clear relationships with learning objectives and identified two shortcomings in the current syllabus for both BHA and a MHA programs.

The 5-year survival rate for patients diagnosed metastatic CRC is only 14%. Effective and well-tolerated therapies, such as dietary supplements, that prevent metastasis may increase the survival of these patients. The ability of the n-3 fatty acids (n-3FAs) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to decrease the proliferation of a variety of cancers in vitro, including CRC, is well established; however, the efficacy of n-3FAs with respect to inhibition of CRC metastasis has received little attention. EPA- and DHA ethyl esters (EE) are alternative forms of n-3FAs that may be more efficacious than free, non-esterified n-3FAs due to their ability to resist degradation allowing them to exert their effects for longer durations. Our objectives were to (1) compare the efficacy of free vs EE-n-3FAs with respect to inhibition of CRC cell proliferation, (2) to determine if EE-n-3FAs decreased CRC cell invasion, and (3) to begin to elucidate the mechanism through which EE-n-3FAs decrease cell invasion. We used two human invasive CRC cell lines, HCT-116 and SW620. To examine the effects of each n-3FA on cellular proliferation, cells were treated with 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 µM free or EE- EPA or DHA for 72 h [CAS numbers: free EPA (10417-94-4), free DHA (6217-54-5), EE-EPA (86227-47-6), EE-DHA (81926-94-5)]. All cells received equal volumes of ethanol vehicle. Data shown are mean +/- n=3 unless indicated. As n-3FA concentration increased, cellular proliferation decreased, regardless of n-3 FA type. Importantly, the IC50 (inhibitory concentration) for EE-EPA (7.7 ± 1.6 µM) was lower than that of free EPA (24.5 ±4.2 µM). The ability of EE-EPA and -DHA to decrease the invasion of CRC cells through Matrigel coated Boyden chambers was assessed following treatment with 12.5 µM EE-EPA or -DHA for 24 h. EE-EPA and EE-DHA inhibited the invasion of HCT-116 cells to 37.1 ± 13.5% and 50.6 ± 17.5% of control, respectively (n=4). Similarly, SW620 cell invasion was decreased to 27.5 ± 9.7% of control by EE-EPA and 24.2 ± 6.7% of control by EE–DHA. The decrease in metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activity, assessed via zymography following EE-n-3FA treatment, reflected the decrease in CRC cell invasion. Finally, EE-n-3FAs failed to inhibit the invasion of HCT-116 cells expressing two alleles of constitutively active phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, suggesting their ability to decrease cell invasion is conferred by inhibition of PI3K activity. In conclusion, EE-n-3FAs are likely more effective inhibitors of CRC proliferation than free n-3FAs, potentially because they are more stable. Additionally, EE-n-3FAs also inhibit CRC invasion and decrease MMP-2 activity through a mechanism that may involve PI3K.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/79/13_Supplement/1606/633784/Abstract-1606-The-ethyl-ester-forms-of-the-n-3",""

Efforts across the United States to increase active transportation (walking, biking and fixed route transportation) by older adults have lacked meaningful input by older adults, are non-theoretical and have had inconclusive results. This paper describes the findings from Phase 1 of the Safe Routes to Age in Place project, a collaboration between Age-Friendly Franklin County, The Ohio State University (OSU) and the University of Texas-Arlington (UT-A), funded by the Ohio Department of Transportation. The aim of the study is to increase the options and safe utilization of active transportation by older persons in three pilot neighborhoods in Franklin County, Ohio utilizing community-based participatory action research strategies with a customized data collection app, MyAmble. The purpose of Phase 1 was to engage city and regional planning students, government officials and older adults to identify “hot spots” in the three pilot neighborhoods. Heat mapping of community data including locations of densely-populated vulnerable older adults, fixed transportation routes, bus stop signage and benches, shared bike stations, bike routes, paratransit routes and pedestrian crash data was completed. Maps were used to identify areas of focus and discussions with municipal leaders and older adult residents further refined target areas to be used in the second phase of the study. Older residents completed walk audits using the MyAmble app and identified issues with sidewalks, crosswalk timers and bus stops. Implications related to age-friendly communities and active transportation are offered.","http://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/3/Supplement_1/S253/33005915/igz038.947.pdf",""

Obesity is associated with increased adiposity and macrophage infiltration both of which promote secretion of adipokines and cytokines in the tumor microenvironment. Specifically, visfatin and resistin have been detected at higher levels in the serum of obese individuals and liver tumors. However, the contribution of these adipocytokines in the progression of liver cancer remains unclear. Materials and methods: The objective of this study was to characterize the effects of visfatin and resistin on HepG2, SNU-449 and HuH7 liver cancer cells. Cells exposed to visfatin and resistin were analyzed for fatty acid synthase protein, and phosphorylation of Akt and ERK tumorigenic signaling pathways, cell viability, lipogenesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) enzyme activity and invasion. Results: HepG2, SNU-449, and HuH7 liver cancer cells treated with visfatin and resistin increased cell viability, invasion, FASN protein, and Akt and ERK phosphorylation. Visfatin and resistin selectively increased ROS production in HepG2 and SNU-449 cells while there was no statistical difference in HuH7 cells. Visfatin and resistin stimulated lipogenesis in HepG2 cells while visfatin increased lipogenesis in SNU-449 cells, and visfatin nor resistin had an effect on lipogenesis in HuH7 cells. Lastly, visfatin and resistin increased MMP-9 enzyme activity in HepG2 and HuH-7 cells but only visfatin increased MMP-9 activity in SNU-449 cells. Conclusions: Future studies are needed to determine if inhibition of ERK and Akt suppresses the visfatin and resistin-induced invasive liver cancer phenotype.","http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/hmbci.2019.38.issue-2/hmbci-2018-0068/hmbci-2018-0068.xml",""

Therefore, discovery and characterization of novel feedstuffs could benefit the producer. Our objective was to evaluate the viability of waste popcorn (Zea mays L.) as a feedstuff in ruminant diets. This objective was addressed through a series of two experiments. In Exp. 1, storage stability of popcorn was evaluated. Popcorn was collected on consecutive weekdays in 2 wk from a local cinema. Samples (n = 10) were subdivided into 9 aliquots and subjected to storage, uncovered, for 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 35, 70, 105, and 140 d. Following the assigned storage time, samples were dried at 55°C to determine weight loss. Following open storage in a laboratory at approximately 24°C, popcorn gained (P < 0.05) between 2.6% (3 d) and 5.6% (105 d) of the original weight through moisture absorption. When dried, however, samples from any length of storage were within 1% of the original weight (P < 0.05). In Exp. 2, a composite sample of popcorn was used in comparison with cracked and steam-flaked corn (Zea mays L.), popped milo [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench ssp. bicolor], and rolled barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Samples were dried at 55°C, ground to pass through a 2-mm screen, and subjected to a batch-culture in vitro assay for digestibility estimates. In vitro true digestibility of popcorn (77.8%) was less (P < 0.05) than estimates for cracked corn (94.8%), popped milo (93.6%), steam-flaked corn (92.6%), or rolled barley (90.3%). From these results, we may conclude that, while popcorn is not as digestible as other commercial energy sources, it may represent a viable option in the arsenal of feed formulation.","http://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/97/Supplement_1/55/29014550/skz053.124.pdf",""

However, the application of cEOR under the harsh conditions of reservoirs where most of today’s crude oils come from remains a challenge. High temperatures, the presence of ions, divalent ions, and heterogeneous rock structures in such reservoirs restrict the application of cEOR. Polymer solutions, surfactants, alkaline-based solutions, and complex multi-components of them are common chemical displacing fluids that failed to show successful recovery results in hostile conditions for various reasons. Wormlike micellar solutions (WMS) are viscoelastic surfactants that possess advantageous characteristics for overcoming current cEOR challenges.

This study estimated birth defect prevalence among the less studied non‐Hispanic (NH) Asian/Pacific Islander (PI) and American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations in Texas relative to NH Whites. Methods: Data were obtained from the Texas Birth Defect Registry from 1999 to 2015 for deliveries to Texas‐resident women who were NH White, NH Asian/PI, or AI/AN. This covers a live birth population of 2.6 million. Prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated for NH Asian/PIs and AI/ANs (relative to NH Whites) for 44 birth defects using Poisson regression adjusting for maternal age. Results: After adjustment there were 33 statistically significant prevalence ratios (aPRs). Among NH Asian/PIs, 23 defects had a lower aPR (0.38–0.86) and three defects had a higher aPR (1.19–2.50). AI/ANs had one defect with a significantly lower aPR (0.64) and six with a higher aPR (1.36–4.63).

Seven beef crossbred, ruminally-cannulated steers (BW = 520 ± 30 kg) were used in a completely randomized design. Steers were individually fed a steam-flaked corn-based finishing diet ad libitum for 21-d. Degradable gel capsules containing 7.5 g of titanium dioxide and chromic oxide were placed inside the rumen through the ruminal-cannulae twice daily, throughout the experiment. Fecal samples were collected twice daily from d 14–21, stored frozen (-20oC), and thawed on d-21 to make a composite sample per steer/day. Wet chemistry analyses of fecal samples included atomic absorption for Cr and spectrophotometry for TiO2 and were compared with PXRF to determine the concentration of these markers on three types of fecal specimens: fresh (average 22.5 % DM), dried (60oC, 72 h), or dried/ground (1 mm). Data were analyzed using the GLIMMIX procedures of SAS with collection day as a repeated measure. Delta between ATTD estimated by wet chemistry and PXRF was not different from zero when using fresh fecal specimens analyzed for Cr (P = 0.40) or Ti (P = 0.14), while for dried or dried/ground specimens it differed (P ≤ 0.04), in which ATTD was underestimated by 3.6 and 1.1 percent units for Cr and Ti, respectively, when using PXRF. Concentration of Ti in fecal specimens was similar (P = 0.39) between analytical methodologies regardless of sample preparation. However, concentration of Cr was underestimated (P &lt; 0.01) by 13% when PXRF was used in dried or dried/ground fecal samples compared to wet chemistry. Detection of Cr and Ti in fresh fecal samples with PXRF spectrometry seems to be a viable alternative to wet chemistry for estimating ATTD for finishing steers.","http://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/97/Supplement_3/322/31255558/skz258.647.pdf",""

Methods: An upper airway model of a 9‐month‐old infant (Sophia Anatomical Infant Nose‐Throat) with an absolute filter distal to the trachea was connected to a breathing simulator to simulate pediatric parameters (tidal volume = 100 mL, respiratory rate = 30 breaths/min, and I:E ratio = 1:1.4). Oxygen at 3 L/min was administered through an infant HFNC (Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand) attached to the nares of the model. Albuterol sulfate (2.5 mg/3 mL) was delivered with JN attached to an aerosol facemask and powered by air at 8 L/min. Ventolin Hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) (360 μg) was administered using pMDI connected to a valved holding chamber (VHC) with a facemask.

Hypotheses drawing on warm-glow theory and the incremental useful information perspective are developed and tested using computer-assisted text analysis (CATA) and event study methodology on a longitudinal sample of 1920 calls, and it is suggested that warm-glow rhetoric positively moderates the relationship between earnings surprises and financial performance (as measured through cumulated abnormal returns).

Previous research has shown reductions in ambulatory blood pressure (BP) with thermoneutral (nonheated) yoga interventions; however, to date, no studies have investigated the safety and efficacy of hot yoga in hypertension (HTN). The purpose of this ongoing trial is to determine whether hot yoga can reduce ambulatory BP, augmentation index (AIx), and perceived stress in unmedicated adults with elevated BP and stage I HTN. Sedentary men and women (ages 20-65yrs) were enrolled if the averages of 3 seated BP measurements were within the elevated BP (120-129 mmHg for systolic with a diastolic <80 mmHg) or stage I HTN (130-139 mmHg for systolic or 80-89 mmHg for diastolic BP) ranges at two separate visits. Twenty-four hours of ambulatory BP monitoring was completed prior to randomization to the yoga or control groups. Yoga group participants (n=5) completed 3 60min Bikram yoga classes (40.5°C) and the control group (n=5) was instructed not to change their physical activity for 12 weeks. AIx and perceived stress were assessed using the SphygmoCor and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Most study participants were African-American (n=3) or Hispanic/Latinx (n=3) and no adverse events occurred. Twenty-four-hour systolic (126±17 to 121±14 mmHg; p=0.01) and diastolic (82±12 to 79±12 mmHg; p=0.04) BPs and PSS scores (14±9 to 10±6; p=0.047) were reduced following the yoga intervention. When comparing waking versus sleeping BPs according to subjects’ reported sleep times, only waking systolic (129±15 to 122±15 mmHg; p=0.016) and diastolic (85±11 to 81±12 mmHg; p = 0.024) BPs declined while no changes in sleeping BPs were detected in the yoga group. AIx (23% to 21%; p =0.58) and body mass were unaltered following the yoga intervention and no outcome variable changed in the control group. Preliminary results support the safety and efficacy of hot yoga in improving ambulatory BP and reducing mental stress, a correlate of HTN, in adults with elevated BP and stage I HTN. These BP reductions were observed in the absence of BP medications or weight loss, and do not appear to be associated with improvements in pulse wave analysis.","",""

Activation of this receptor is dependent on paracrine ligand induction, and its preferred ligand, PDGFB, is released by neighboring epithelial and endothelial cells. While expression of both PDGFRβ and PDGFB has been noted in patient breast tumors for decades, how PDGFB-to-PDGFRβ tumor-stromal signaling mediates breast cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis remains unclear. To test this important research question, we developed a mouse model of mesenchymal-specific PDGFRβ hyper-activation. PDGFRβ mutant mammary glands exhibit increased tertiary side-branching and epithelial proliferation confirming a stromal-specific PDGFRβ effect on neighboring epithelium during normal development. To test the effect of hyper-active mesenchymal PDGFRβ on disease progression, experimental tail vein metastasis assays were performed where we observed prominent brain metastases in 50% of the PDGFRβ mutantmice (n=5/10) with no brain lesions seen in controls (n=0/19). There was no difference in the incidence of lung or liver metastases in the mutant mice suggesting a pro-metastatic function for PDGFRβ in the brain metastatic niche. To rule out dysfunction of the blood brain barrier contributing to the observed metastatic spread, we then intracranially injected mammary tumor cells, and as expected based on our metastasis assay, found that larger tumors formed in the brains of PDGFRβ mutant mice versus controls. To our knowledge, these combined findings are the first example where genetic manipulation of the stroma increases breast cancer associated brain metastases (BCBM). Given that these pre-clinical data suggest that primary breast tumors expressing high PDGFB could preferentially metastasize to the brain, we analyzed PDGFB protein expression in a tissue microarray comprised of HER2-positive and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) primary tumors (total n=425). While high PDGFB did not correlate with site-independent metastatic recurrence, it was prognostic of brain metastasis, mirroring our mouse data. Evaluation of PDGFB in a small cohort of matched primary breast tumors with associated brain (n=5) and lung metastases (n=2) revealed intense PDGFB staining in 100% of the brain metastases, but only 50% of the lung metastases. These findings further suggest that high primary tumor PDGFBexpression defines a subset of breast cancer patients predisposed to brain metastases and that these patients may benefit from therapeutic inhibition of PDGFRβ signaling. To test this pre-clinically, we treated mice harboring intracranial tumors with the PDGFR specific inhibitor crenolanib. Excitingly, crenolanib treatment significantly inhibited the brain tumor burden in these mice. Combined, our findings to date (1) advocate that primary tumor expression of PDGFB is a novel prognostic biomarker for the development of BCBM and (2) support clinical trial evaluation of PDGFR inhibitors for the prevention and treatment of BCBM. Ongoing studies are evaluating how the PDGFRβ-expressing mesenchymal cells within the brain promote a pro-metastatic niche.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/79/4_Supplement/PD9-11/640308/Abstract-PD9-11-Platelet-derived-growth-factor",""

The objective was to identify the factors that affect nursing care of patients who undergo robotic‐assisted laparoscopic surgery (RALS). Background: The rapid introduction of technological innovations into the healthcare system has created new challenges for perioperative nurses. RALS affects the physical and interpersonal context of the surgical team's work and subsequent patient outcomes. Despite significant changes to the workflow for perioperative nurses and CRNAs, there is little research focusing on the nurses’ experience and their challenges with RALS. Design: A qualitative descriptive study. Method: Semi‐structured interview questions guided data collection. A total of seventeen participants including six preoperative and postoperative nurses, seven intraoperative nurses, and four CRNAs in the United States were interviewed. The interviews were conducted between 26 April–24 June 2018. Data were analysed using thematic analysis, and the COREQ checklist was used to report data collection, analysis and the results. Results: Three major themes and two categories within each theme were identified: (a) surgical innovation: nurse perception and workflow; (b) interprofessional practice: teamwork and standards; and (c) outcome: patient outcomes and system outcomes. Conclusions: The findings indicate that RALS has the potential to improve patient outcomes when performed in a timely fashion by skilled surgeons, and efficient, well‐trained surgical teams. For patients to experience full benefits of RALS, patient characteristics, the underlying reason for surgery, and cost must be considered.

In three studies, the concurrent validity of the scale was assessed with several domain-specific lying scales, two Machiavellianism scales, a social desirability scale, and reports of actual lie frequency over a 24-hour period. The scale was also assessed for interitem consistency (Cronbach’s α) and test-retest reliability. We found that the LiES scale was a reliable and valid measure of lying.

Furthermore, EMT results in the acquisition of stem-cell markers and an increased ability to initiate tumor growth, supporting the concept that EMT may contribute to the development of a small, persistent sub-population of the tumor called cancer stem cells (CSCs). Cells that have undergone EMT have characteristically suppressed cell cycles, making them resistant to commonly used chemotherapies that target DNA replication or microtubule dynamics, processes essential to replicating cells. Nonspecific treatments can also rely on inducing apoptotic cell death; however, recent debates challenge the efficacy of apoptosis in solid tumors, citing high rates of acquired resistance. Utilizing a compound that induces alternative cell death, namely paraptosis, becomes attractive when these other treatments fail. Relying on an activated gene expression program, paraptosis results in the swelling of the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum and Apaf-1-independent alternative caspase-9 activity. Treating with paraptosis-inducing compounds such as Ophiobolin A (OpA) specifically targets otherwise-insensitive CSC and EMT cells to re-sensitize bulk tumor populations to chemotherapies. We describe EMT as a key driver of enhanced sensitivity to paraptosis-induced cell death following short-term treatment with OpA or other paraptosis-inducing compounds. Further, paraptosis selectively eliminates the CSC sub-population by reducing stem cell activity and highlights the potential of this pathway in breast cancer treatment.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/79/4_Supplement/P4-07-10/639663/Abstract-P4-07-10-Epithelial-mesenchymal",""

Eating self-regulation is the link between eating intention and behavior. However, the extent to which these factors influence overweight and obesity has not been thoroughly studied. The study examined nutrition knowledge, attitudes, and eating self-regulation as predictors of overweight and obesity among adults in a community setting. Methods:: A total of 313 adults participated in an online survey, which included the General Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire–Revised, the Nutrition Attitudes Questionnaire, and the Self-Regulation of Eating Behavior Questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, Kendall's tau tests, and multivariate logistic regression procedures were performed. Conclusions:: More than half of the participants were either overweight or obese (56.5%). The mean nutrition knowledge score was 74.1%, and only 28.1% correctly identified the body mass index for obesity. Positive predictors of overweight and obesity included poor eating self-regulation of giving up too easily on eating intentions (odds ratio [OR] = 3.81), male gender (OR = 2.0), and age (OR = 1.03), whereas nutrition attitudes were a negative predictor (OR = 0.74). Implications for practice:: The odds of overweight or obesity were nearly four times greater for those who gave up too easily on their eating intentions. Nurse practitioners can play a critical role in establishing healthy dietary habits to maintain weight control by promoting good eating self-regulation, despite the current obesogenic environment. After assessing patient readiness and motivation, it is important to help patients make eating self-regulation as manageable as possible to promote long-term weight management.","https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/JXX.0000000000000169",""

Many studies have found factors that affect beef flavor, but little is known about variability of major beef cuts in the retail meat case where meat is displayed, and customers can choose from.Materials and MethodsFour beef cuts (chuck roast, top sirloin steaks, top loin steaks, and 80/20 ground beef) were obtained from retail stores in Miami, Los Angeles, Portland, New York, and Denver within a 2-mo period. The study wanted a variety of samples that were from different production systems or contained certain claims that would be available to customers. The meat was shipped with dry ice and stored at –9°C. For evaluation steaks, roasts, and ground beef were thawed 24 h at 4°C. Prior to cooking, chuck roasts were cut 10.16 × 12.7cm from the center of the roast. Each ground beef sample was formulated into 3, approximately 150 g patties. Chuck roasts were placed in a roasting pan on a roasting rack and 2 cups of water. Beef steaks and ground beef patties were cooked on a stovetop grill and cooked to 71°C, steaks and patties were flipped when temperature reached 35°F. Chuck roasts were cut into 1.27cm cubes with no visible connective tissue, fat, or outside browning. Steaks were cut into 1.27cm cubes with no connective tissue or fat. Ground beef patties were cut into 6 wedges. Panelists were served either 2 wedges or 2 1.27 cm samples for evaluation. An expert trained descriptive flavor and texture sensory panel was conducted where panelists evaluated beef flavors and textures. Beef flavor and texture attributes were analyzed using SAS (version 9.4, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) and principal component (PCA) bi-plots were generated using XLSTAT (Addinsoft, Inc., Long Island City, NY) using P < 0.05.ResultsChuck roasts were associated with bloody/serumy flavor aromatics. Ground beef patties were clustered with fat-like, overall sweet, green hay, and buttery flavor aromatics. Top sirloin steaks samples were more highly associated with off flavors such as liver, cardboardy, and sour flavor aromatics. Top loin steaks were clustered with positive attributes such as umami, beef flavor identity, and brown, roasted flavor aromatics. For the PCA biplot, factor 1 accounted for 60% and factor 2 accounted for 28% of variation. Ground beef was higher (P < 0.0001) in brown, fat like, green hay, sour milk/sour dairy, flavor aromatics, and had more salty and sweet basic taste than the other cuts. Ground beef patties had the least amount (P < 0.0001) of bloody/serumy, metallic, and liver like flavor aromatics. Chuck roasts had the least (P < 0.0001) beef flavor id, brown, roasted flavor aromatics and salt and umami basic taste. Sirloin steaks had the lowest (P < 0.0001) fat like flavor aromatic and the highest levels (P < 0.0001) of burnt and cardboardy flavor aromatics and bitter and sour basic taste. Sirloin steaks and chuck roasts had more metallic and liver like (P < 0.0001) flavor aromatics than other cuts. Top loin steaks were intermediate in flavor attributes.ConclusionFlavor descriptive attributes of four beef cuts differed. Results indicated that chuck roasts and top sirloin steaks were associated with negative flavor attributes. Ground beef contained sweeter, fat like attributes with exceptions of green hay, while top loin steaks were associated with more positive beef flavor attributes.","https://www.iastatedigitalpress.com/mmb/article/10745/galley/10152/download/",""

While the use of by- or co-products can help offset the costs of feeding cattle, these feeds often increase in price with increased adoption. Wastes from human enterprises may represent the next step in feedstuff investigation. Our objective was to evaluate the suitability of newspaper as a component of silage for ruminant feeding. Newspapers were obtained from the Dick Smith Library and JTAC News at Tarleton State University (Stephenville, TX). Samples were cut into strips (approximately 4.0 × 30.2 mm) using an office shredder. Sorghum-sudangrass [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench ssp. drummondii (Nees ex Steud.) de Wet & Harlan] was harvested and cut by hand to lengths of approximately 10 cm. Samples were combined to achieved DM ratios of 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100% newspaper and sorghum-sudangrass. Distilled water was added to achieve 45% DM. Samples were packed in a double layer of plastic sheeting and sealed in 19 L buckets. Laboratory silos were arranged in a Latin square design in a laboratory and allowed to ferment for 35 d. Ensiled samples were assayed for DM, particle size, and silage acids. There was no effect of newspaper percentage (P = 0.47) on silage pH. Ammonia (0.04 to 1.2% DM), total VFA (0.01 to 4.8% DM), lactic acid (0 to 46.6% VFA), and acetic acid (0.01 to 2.4% DM) increased linearly (P < 0.01) with increased concentration of sorghum-sudangrass. Results indicated that newspaper alone was not an effective feedstuff to ensile. However, addition of newspaper to grass silages could represent a viable means to decrease cost and extend resources for ruminant animal producers.","http://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/97/Supplement_1/56/29014596/skz053.126.pdf",""

However, little is known about how illness perception influences SRH in Chinese American patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). This study, guided by Leventhal’s Self-Regulatory Model, explored the association between illness perception and SRH beyond socioeconomic and health factors. A cross-sectional survey from 109 community-dwelling foreign-born Chinese Americans with T2DM (60-95 years old; 51.4% females; Mean age= 74.17, SD=6.83). In addition to descriptive and correlation analysis, hierarchical regression models of SRH was estimated by subsequently entering the following set of predictors: (1) demographics (age, gender, marital status, education, financial status, and acculturation), (2) health factors (insulin usage, length of diabetes, number of chronic condition, depression, and diabetes distress) and (3) illness perception (timeline, disease consequence, personal and treatment control). SRH was measured by asking “How would you rate your overall health?” with a likert response scale: 1 (poor) to 4 (very good). Only 50.5 % of participants rated their health as good or very good. Participants with lower acculturation, higher number of chronic health conditions, higher diabetes distress, and a belief that illness will have more negative consequences were highly correlated with worse SRH. The total amount of variance explained by the entire model was 56% (F = 6.07, p &lt; .001). These findings suggest that the modifiable factors such as acculturation, diabetes distress, and the belief of diabetes consequences should be incorporated into integrative health promotion efforts for this population.","http://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/3/Supplement_1/S493/33007146/igz038.1829.pdf",""

Materials and Methods: Fifty-one children with ASD (five females and 46 males) aged 7–12 participated in the study. The Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2 (MABC-2) was used to examine children’s fine and gross motor skill competence; the nutrition knowledge survey assessed children’s overall knowledge of food groups and healthful eating; and BMI-for-age determined their weight status. Descriptive analysis and Pearson correlation was used to analyze the relationship between nutrition knowledge, BMI, and motor competence in children with ASD. Results: The majority of children with ASD (82%) showed significant motor delays in MABC-2 assessments. The BMI-for-age percentile data suggested that 20% of participants were obese, 17% were overweight, and 12% were underweight. The nutrition knowledge data indicated that 55% of children scored below 70% on accuracy in the nutrition knowledge survey. Pearson correlation analysis revealed a significant positive relationship between MABC-2 manual dexterity and nutrition knowledge (r = 0.327, p < 0.01), and between MABC-2 balance skills and nutrition knowledge (r = 0.413, p < 0.01). A significant negative relationship was also found between BMI and MABC-2 balance skills (r = −0.325, p < 0.01). Conclusions: The findings of the study suggest that nutrition knowledge and motor competence may be key factors influencing BMI in children with ASD and therefore interventions tackling both sides of the energy balance equation are necessary.","https://www.mdpi.com/1648-9144/55/5/135/pdf",""

Using 3 years of data from the National Incident-Based Reporting System for robbery incidents, assault incidents, and sexual offenses, the study finds that the relative likelihood of arrest for group-offender incidents, compared with lone-offender incidents, varies by incident type. For robbery incidents, the likelihood of arrest increases when committed by a group of offenders. Yet, for assault incidents and sexual offenses, the likelihood of arrest decreases when committed by a group of offenders. Further analysis looks more closely at incidents committed by a group of offenders and how the number of offenders in the group affects the likelihood of arrest. A consistent finding is that for each incident type, the likelihood that all offenders in a group will be arrested is lower as the number of offenders increases, which may justify offenders’ perceptions of “safety in larger numbers.”","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0886260519872308",""

The guidelines provide the following recommendations for managing 10 health-related factors at each of the first four canine life stages: lifestyle effect on the patient’s safety, zoonotic and human safety risk, behavior, nutrition, parasite control, vaccination, dental health, reproduction, breed-specific conditions, and a baseline diagnostic profile.","http://meridian.allenpress.com/jaaha/article-pdf/55/6/267/2481969/jaaha-ms-6999.pdf",""

One member of the family, LARP6, regulates the synthesis of type I collagen by binding the 5′ untranslated region of the mRNA and facilitating its localization to the ER membrane. Aberrant collagen expression is a key feature of fibroproliferative diseases such as osteogenesis imperfecta. Therefore, LARP6 is a potential target for treatment of these diseases. However, the mechanisms of LARP6 cellular localization remain unclear. Previously published work transfected a GFP‐tagged LARP6 harboring a deletion of a putative nuclear export sequence (NES‐RBD) within the RNA binding domain. The NES deletion mutant was observed to accumulate in the nucleus, suggesting nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The purpose of the current study is to understand this nuclear export mechanism in concert with recent structural data for the RNA‐binding domain of LARP6. First, we investigated the localization of endogenous LARP6 in immortalized cell lines using immunocytochemistry and leptomycin B treatment to inhibit classical nuclear transport mechanisms. These experiments demonstrated challenges with the selectivity of commercial antibodies for endogenous levels of human LARP6 in mammalian cells. Additionally, we used a recently‐developed algorithm, LocNES, to identify a second candidate NES motif in the C‐terminus of LARP6 (NES‐CTD) and to clarify the boundaries of the NES‐RBD effectively breaking it into two candidates (NES‐RBD1 and NES‐RBD2). Two approaches were used to test these new candidate motifs. First, the predicted NES motifs were cloned as fusions to GST and purified in preparation for pulldown assays to directly assess interaction with the transporter CRM1. Second, bacterial expression constructs of the wildtype and deletion mutants of the two predicted NES were constructed to analyze the effects of the NES deletions on recombinant protein stability. Chemical and thermal denaturation of the recombinant proteins was monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy to measure the free energy of folding. While all of the GST‐NES fusions are readily expressed in bacteria, only the NES‐CTD candidate motif is readily purified. The high hydrophobicity of the two NES‐RBD candidate motifs appears to prevent their purification. Together, the observed differences in the stability of GST‐NES peptides and the LARP6‐NES deletion mutants suggest that manipulation of the hydrophobic‐rich regions complicates the biochemical efforts to elucidate the mechanism of nuclear export of LARP6.","",""

Performance, DMI, and FB traits were measured for 70 to 100 d in 15 trials with Holstein heifers (n = 611) fed a corn-silage based ration. Seventeen FB traits were evaluated: frequency and duration of bunk visit (BV) and meal events, head-down duration (HDD), meal length, maximum non-feeding interval, corresponding day-to-day variation (SD) of these traits, and ratios of HDD per BV duration and meal duration, HDD per meal duration, and BV events per meal event. Data were analyzed using a mixed model that included RFI group and trial. The PLSR model for RFI was developed using cross-validation procedures (Leave-One-Out) in JMP (SAS), with FB traits as independent variables. Low-RFI heifers consumed 24% less (P < 0.01) DMI and had lower (P < 0.01) day-to-day DMI variation than high-RFI heifers. Distinct differences were observed in FB patterns between low- and high-RFI heifers (Table 1). Eight of 17 FB traits were included [selected based on variable of importance (VIP) score > 0.80] in the PLSR model that explained 33% of the variation in RFI. Head-down duration had the highest VIP score; accordingly, low-RFI animals had 44% lower HDD and 30 and 40% lower ratios of HDD per BV duration and meal duration, respectively. Additionally, low-RFI animals had 20 and 18% fewer BV and meal events per day, spent 21% less time eating during BV events, and had reduced day-to-day variation in HDD and meal frequency. For this study, distinctive differences were observed in the FB patterns of Holstein heifers with divergent RFI, which explained 33% of the between-animal variation in RFI.","http://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/97/Supplement_1/61/29014480/skz053.138.pdf",""

Wastes from human enterprises may represent the next step in feedstuff investigation. In an effort to minimize the anthropogenic waste contribution, and as a means to find a more cost-efficient resource to feed ruminant animals, our objective was to determine the nutritive value of disposable coffee cups and warmer sleeves in relation to ruminant nutrition. Discarded cups and warmer sleeves were collected from employees at Tarleton State University in fall of 2017. Cups were obtained from five sources, and warmer sleeves were obtained from two sources. Cups and sleeves were dried at 55°C for 72 h and ground to pass through a 2-mm screen. Ground samples were subjected to a batch-culture in vitro true digestibility (IVTD) assay. Original samples and incubated residues were then assayed for DM, NDF, ADF, and CP. Data were analyzed as a random effects model completely randomized design using the MIXED procedure of SAS. There was no effect (P > 0.05) of source (n = 5) or type (cup or sleeve) for contribution to variance of NDF, ADF, IVTD, and in vitro NDF digestibility (IVNDFD). Mean values for NDF, ADF, IVTD, and IVNDFD across samples were 89.5, 81.4, 24.5, and 18.7%, respectively. Results indicate a low digestibility coefficient for these waste products, thus meaning its use as a feedstuff could be questionable. However, such results provide insight into niches where this product and other anthropogenic wastes may fit in the larger picture of ruminant nutrition","http://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/97/Supplement_1/54/29014529/skz053.123.pdf",""

This study is critically important in better understanding the bioaccumulation and depletion of RH in live animals, and how this may relate to depletion in differing tissues on animal harvest.This study was designed to determine dose response and depletion curves in the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract of fistulated (i.e., cannulated- both rumen and duodenal) steers either receiving or not receiving ractopamine hydrochloride as part of the daily ration. There were originally five steers in this study, but due to performance challenges and scarring issues, one animal was removed from the study for a total of four test subjects.Materials and MethodsIn the dose and depletion study, four steers (n = 2 not receiving RH and n = 2 receiving RH at the approved dosage) were assessed from –3 d (still receiving RH if on the RH treatment) to 13 d post-withdrawal to determine the amount of RH present and length of time required for RH to clear the GI tract should a contamination event of low levels occur. Residues were quantified using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS).ResultsFor the dose and depletion study, RH residues were quantified in rumen fluids, rumen solids, fecal material, and duodenal fluids. Overall, the RH present in the two control steers (which did not receive RH) declined from approximately 30 ppb in all matrices 3 d before withdrawal to below the limit of quantitation at the end of withdrawal. Furthermore, samples tended to be below the limit of quantitation by Day 4 post-withdrawal. The steers that received RH also exhibited a decline of RH throughout the withdrawal period for all matrices (e.g., 5800 ppb in rumen fluids at day –3 versus 1.81 ppb 13 d post-withdrawal).ConclusionThe dose and depletion study results suggest that RH declines rapidly in the lower GI of beef cattle, with levels below detection by day four. There are events in which RH declines and then spikes, so further research may be necessary to determine why this rapid increase occurs.","https://www.iastatedigitalpress.com/mmb/article/10723/galley/10170/download/",""

Secondary objectives were to determine if clinical signs of respiratory disease, age, sex, weight, body condition score, recumbency, or thoracic depth‐to‐width ratio had any influence on vertebral heart scale measurements in this breed. The electronic medical record systems of two universities were reviewed and Norwich terriers were included in the study if they had orthogonal thoracic radiographs performed and no historical or radiographic evidence of cardiopulmonary disease. A vertebral heart scale was calculated for each patient. Sixty‐one client‐owned, Norwich terrier dogs with no clinical signs of cardiovascular disease were evaluated. The vertebral heart scale for Norwich terriers without evidence of cardiac disease (10.6 ± 0.6) was found to be significantly greater than the canine reference value of 9.7 ± 0.5 initially established by Buchanan and Bücheler. No significant correlation was found between clinical signs of respiratory disease, sex, age, thoracic depth‐to‐width ratio or lateral recumbency, and vertebral heart scale.

As role models, school employees play a significant part in creating a healthy environment. Research suggests that employee wellness programs (EWPs) may help school employees adopt healthier lifestyles and, therefore, be healthier, more productive, and serve as healthy role models for students. This article describes the process by which a school district in central Texas partnered with a local university to plan, develop, and implement an affordable EWP. METHODS: A university‐led leadership team sought input from employees, including administrators, and conducted a 4‐week trial. These resulted in an EWP that provided health risk appraisals, fitness testing, group exercise classes, education seminars, online wellness resources, and blood draws/analysis. RESULTS: During the first 4 years, membership ranged from 107 to 384 (10–37%), and the annual cost of the program ranged from $49 to $116 per participating employee. CONCLUSIONS: University‐led EWP programs can support, at a low cost, the health of school employees. Despite low employee engagement, need was demonstrated and feedback was positive. Challenges identified include time demands and lack of principals' support. Future considerations include targeting principals, utilizing the Human Resources Office, and strategically building a culture of health.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fjosh.12791",""

We compared the initial cancer treatment and cancer‐specific mortality of SEER‐Medicare patients with locoregional high‐grade (nonmetastatic) prostate cancer with and without preexisting SMI. Methods: We identified SEER‐Medicare patients who were 67 years of age or older diagnosed between 2006 and 2013 with locoregional high‐grade (nonmetastatic) prostate cancer. Preexisting SMI was identified by claims indicative of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and other psychotic disorder, during the 2 years before cancer diagnosis. We used multivariable binary logistic regression to examine associations between SMI and receipt of surgery or radiation concurrent with hormone therapy (definitive initial treatment) within 1 year after cancer diagnosis. We used Kaplan‐Meier survival curves, as well as Cox proportional hazards and competing risk models to evaluate unadjusted and adjusted associations between SMI and 5‐year cancer‐specific survival. Results: Among 49 985 patients with locoregional high‐grade (nonmetastatic) prostate cancer, 523 (1.1%) had SMI and 49 462 (98.9%) had no SMI.

Therefore, we investigate TMT conflict (cognitive and affective) to understand how the firm-level knowledge capability of absorptive capacity (ACAP) is altered as a result of such types of conflict. Further, given that strategic orientations offer guiding principles for organisational behaviours, we suggest that the main effects of conflict are augmented by strategic orientations. Specifically, both entrepreneurial orientation and market orientation are posited to affect the relationship between conflict and ACAP, which expands understanding of the conditions in which TMT conflict affects ACAP. In all, a conceptual framework is developed to offer insight into how TMT conflict affects firm-level ACAP, highlighting differences that are dependent on whether team members collaborate via cognitive conflict or clash given affective conflict.","https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S1363919619500233",""

Studies suggest that hypertension prevalence among PLWH is high, yet none assess how the 2017 redefinition of hypertension as ≥130/80 rather than the previous standard of ≥140/90 mm Hg will affect prevalence among PLWH. This study addresses this gap. METHODS: We examined medical record abstractions of 957 PLWH in Texas from the 2013–2014 Medical Monitoring Project survey. Participants with hypertension were identified by charted diagnosis, antihypertensive medication use, or blood pressure readings ≥140/90 and ≥130/80 mm Hg. Associations with sociodemographic and clinical variables were assessed using Rao–Scott chi-square tests, and odds of having hypertension were calculated using multivariable logistic regression models while adjusting for several demographic and HIV-related variables. RESULTS: The 2017 redefinition of hypertension increased prevalence in the sample by 44.3%, from 47.6% to 68.7%. Age group, body mass index, sex, and race remained significantly associated with hypertension (all P &lt; 0.01). Although prevalence was near equal between males and females at ≥140/90 mm Hg (47.4% and 48.5%, respectively), males were 2.36 times more likely to have hypertension than females (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.55–3.60) at ≥130/80 mm Hg. Prevalence remained comparable between white (73.3%) and black participants (72.9%). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that hypertension prevalence is remarkably high among PLWH and is further increased by updated guidelines. Barriers to hypertension control in the HIV care setting should be identified and addressed to facilitate continued improvement in the quality and length of life for PLWH.","http://academic.oup.com/ajh/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/ajh/hpz078/28785030/hpz078.pdf",""

In this study, we revealed and quantitatively assessed the overall status of prestraining and residual stresses exerted by the epicardial layer on the heart left ventricle (LV). During porcine heart wall dissection, we discovered that bi-layered LV surface strips, consisting of an epicardial layer and cardiac muscle, always curled towards the epicardial side due to epicardial residual stresses. We hence developed a curling angle characterization technique to intuitively and qualitatively reveal the location-dependency and direction-dependency of epicardial residual stresses. Moreover, by combining prestrain measurement and biaxial mechanical testing, we were able to quantify the epicardial prestrains and residual stresses on the unpressurized intact LV. To investigate the potential mechanical effect of epicardial prestraining, a finite-element (FE) model has been constructed, and we demonstrate that it is the prestraining of the epicardial layer, not the epicardial layer alone, providing an additional resistance mechanism during LV diastolic expansion and ventricular wall protection by reducing myocardial stress. In short, our study on healthy, native porcine hearts has revealed an important phenomenon—the epicardial layer, rich in elastin, acts like a prestrained ‘balloon’ that wraps around the heart and functions as an extra confinement and protection interface. The obtained knowledge fills a gap in ventricular biomechanics and will help design novel biomimicking materials or prosthetic devices to target the maintenance/recreation of this ventricle confinement interface.","http://journals.lww.com/00003012-201908021-00503",""

Positive affectivity has a robust positive effect on meaning in life, suggesting that positive awe experiences might increase meaning. At the same time, however, awe experiences lead to a diminished self that reflects feelings of smallness and insignificance, which might negatively predict meaning.

Biological processes at the implant‐tissue interface are critical for implant osseointegration. Superior mechanical properties of the implant constitute a major challenge for traditional histological techniques. It is imperative to develop new technique to investigate the implant‐tissue interface. Materials and methods: Our laboratory developed the polyethylene glycol (PEG)‐associated solvent system (PEGASOS) tissue clearing method. By immersing samples into various chemical substances, bones and teeth could be turned to transparent with intact internal structures and endogenous fluorescence being preserved. We combined the PEGASOS tissue clearing method with transgenic mouse line and other labelling technique to investigate the angiogenesis and osteogenesis processes occurring at the implant‐bone interface. Results: Clearing treatment turned tissue highly transparent and implant could be directly visualized without sectioning. Implant, soft/hard tissues and fluorescent labels were simultaneously imaged in decalcified or non‐decalcified mouse mandible samples without disturbing their interfaces. Multi‐channel 3‐dimensional image stacks at high resolution were acquired and quantified. The processes of angiogenesis and osteogenesis surrounding titanium or stainless steel implants were investigated. Conclusions: Both titanium and stainless steel implants support angiogenesis at comparable levels. Successful osseointegration and calcium precipitation occurred only surrounding titanium, but not stainless steel implants.

The capability data is extracted either directly from the website of manufacturing firms or from their profiles in e-sourcing portals and directories. Feature extraction and dimensionality reduction process in this work are supported by N-gram extraction and latent semantic analysis (LSA) methods.

Seventeen FB traits were evaluated: frequency and duration of bunk visit (BV) and meal events, head-down duration (HDD), meal length, maximum non-feeding interval, corresponding day-today variation (SD) of these traits, and ratios of HDD per BV duration and meal duration, HDD per meal duration, and BV events per meal event. Data was analyzed using a mixed model that included RFI group and trial. The PLSR model for RFI was developed using cross-validation procedures (Leave-One-Out) in JMP (SAS), with FB traits as independent variables. LowRFI heifers consumed 24% less (P < 0.01) DMI and had lower (P < 0.01) day-to-day DMI variation than high-RFI heifers. Distinct differences were observed in FB patterns between low- and high-RFI heifers (Table 1).

MEK activation in tumor cells can increase replication of ICP34.5-deleted herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), but paradoxically its activation in tumor-associated macrophages promotes a pro-inflammatory signaling that can inhibit virus replication and propagation. Here we investigated the effect of blocking MEK signaling in conjunction with oncolytic HSV-1 (oHSV) for brain tumors. Methods: Infected glioma cells co-cultured with microglia or macrophages treated with or without trametinib were used to test trametinib effect on macrophages/microglia. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, western blotting, and flow cytometry were utilized to evaluate the effect of the combination therapy. Pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of mouse plasma and brain tissue was used to evaluate trametinib delivery to the CNS. Intracranial human and mouse glioma-bearing immune deficient and immune competent mice were used to evaluate the antitumor efficacy. Result: Oncolytic HSV treatment rescued trametinib-mediated feedback reactivation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway in glioma. In vivo, PK analysis revealed enhanced blood–brain barrier penetration of trametinib after oHSV treatment. Treatment by trametinib, a MEK kinase inhibitor, led to a significant reduction in microglia- and macrophage-derived tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) secretion in response to oHSV treatment and increased survival of glioma-bearing mice.

In the following paper, we offer examples from three Head Start classrooms to demonstrate multiple ways that young children act civically in everyday ways. When classrooms and teachers afford young children more agency, children’s civic capabilities expand, and they are able to act on behalf of and with their community.

ASHA's 32-year transition from no formal multicultural education to mandatory multicultural education infusion provokes to enquire whether multicultural education in speech-language pathologists (SLPs) has modified SLPs' perceptions toward multicultural issues. In this article, we explored an aspect of such sensitivity. We want to know whether there exists a linear relationship between SLPs' age, as an index of their exposure to formal multicultural education, and SLPs' bias toward nonnative accent, as an index of their multicultural sensitivity. Method: Two hundred sixty-eight SLP ASHA members completed a web-based pilot survey testing whether SLPs made biased associations based on personality traits, sociocultural factors, professional attire, and physical appearance of persons with nonnative accent and whether the SLPs thought they had an accent. Logistic regression tested whether age predicts explicit biased associations for these five outcomes. Results: ASHA SLPs made biased associations with accent for all outcomes, but age only predicted the likelihood of explicit accent-based biases for physical appearance. The relationship was curvilinear, with 40- to 45-year-olds making the most biased associations and older SLPs making progressively fewer biased associations. Conclusion: Clearly, the specific psychosocial attributes associated with perception of nonnative accent need to be explored from a dynamical systems perspective to discover potential variables that might directly or indirectly influence accent perception and potential biases.","http://pubs.asha.org/doi/pdf/10.1044/2019_PERS-SIG17-2019-0030",""

Molasses (3% of diet DM) was added to all treatments to improve diet palatability. On d 22 of each period, fecal and rumen samples for in vitro procedure were collected 0 and 2 hr after feeding, respectively. Rumen (10 g) and fecal (20 g) samples were added to 100 ml Wheaton vials with buffer solution at 1:5 and 1:2 ratio, respectively. Vials were incubated at 39°C, and samples were collected at 6 and 24 hr to determine gas production. Methane was analyzed using gas chromatography. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS.

For the presented study, a downhole shale sample is analyzed in the laboratory to predict gas storage properties such as pore-volume, pore compressibility, and gas adsorption capacity. Then a series of pressure pulse decay measurements are performed to delineate transport mechanisms and predict stress-sensitive permeability. These coefficients are obtained as the calibration parameters of a simulation-based optimization for injection and production. Simulation model considers compositional gas flow in a deformable porous media and includes a multi-continuum porosity, with organic and inorganic pores, and micro-fractures. The experimental and simulation results show that most of the injected CO2 is adsorbed in the organic matrix and are not produced back. This is because CO2 molecules have significantly larger adsorption capacity when compared to methane. The strong adsorption of CO2 improves the release of natural gas from kerogen pores. This indicates that the separation of produced CO2 will be a minimal cost. Transport in kerogen has significant pore wall effects, and includes large mass fluxes of the adsorbed molecules by the walls due to surface diffusion. In essence, the adsorbed CO2 molecules significantly influence transport of methane. The results also show core-plug permeability is stress-sensitive due to presence of micro-fractures. Forward simulation results using optimum parameters indicate that closure stress developing near the fractures could significantly control the volume of CO2 injected. This raises operational issues on when to start injecting, and how to inject CO2. Using a simulation study of a production well with single-fracture, we show that fracture closure stress develops rapidly and production rate becomes a slave of the fracture geo-mechanics, e.g., strength of the proppants and the level of proppant embedment.","http://onepetro.org/SPEEURO/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/195528-MS/1174014/spe-195528-ms.pdf",""

Methodology: This study adopts a mixed‐methods approach using descriptive statistics to examine the distribution of language content among MOOCs, and qualitative content analysis to understand the motivations, resources, and methods behind initiatives to create MOOC language content. Results: The availability of MOOCs varies significantly by language, with a preponderance of English‐language courses available compared to other world languages. Furthermore, a qualitative content analysis of initiatives to expand MOOC language content reveals a diverse ensemble of actors whose varied motivations, resources, and methods may widen existing inequalities structuring access to online learning despite expanding the availability of MOOCs in non‐English languages. Conclusion: By revealing the availability of online content structuring access to capital‐enhancing uses of the Internet, studies of online content can help explain sociodemographic differences in Internet accessibility and usage, and can delineate digital divides along lines of inequality, when content is available to some people but not others, as well as inequity, when content is available but not useful in people's contexts of use.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ssqu.12691",""

This paper provides a broad review of the applications of remote sensing techniques in fire ecology. Remote sensing applications related to fire risk mapping, fuel mapping, active fire detection, burned area estimates, burn severity assessment, and post-fire vegetation recovery monitoring are discussed. Emphasis is given to the roles of multispectral sensors, lidar, and emerging UAS technologies in mapping, analyzing, and monitoring various environmental properties related to fire activity. Examples of current and past research are provided, and future research trends are discussed. In general, remote sensing technologies provide a low-cost, multi-temporal means for conducting local, regional, and global-scale fire ecology research, and current research is rapidly evolving with the introduction of new technologies and techniques which are increasing accuracy and efficiency.

In Texas, the most popular hair type breed of sheep is the Dorper. Various breed characteristics make the Dorper sheep an excellent candidate for an accelerated lambing system. Reproductive performance of Dorper ewes with various lengths of post-partum interval, during the traditional non-breeding season, was determined. During May (13L:11D), 2+ yr-old multiparous ewes (n = 28) were joined with a fertile ram for 30 d. Weekly blood samples were taken for progesterone analysis. Ewes were blocked according to length of post-partum interval (lamb to ram): short (SPP; n = 10, 100 ± 2.7 d), mid (MPP; n = 11, 130 ± 0.68 d) and long (LPP; n = 7, &gt;200 d). Weaning age of lamb(s) from previous parturition was similar for SPP (62 ± 3.2 d) and MPP (67 ± 0.6 d). Interestingly, 11% of the ewes had a functional CL at initiation of the study (P4 &gt; 1.5 ng/mL). Mean body condition score for SPP, MPP, and LPP ewes were 2.8 ± 0.08, 3.1 ± 0.09, and 3.7 ± 0.08, respectively. Pregnancy rates were similar between MPP (100%), LPP (100%) and SPP (60%). Overall, pregnancy rate was 87% and a lamb crop (lambs per ewe exposed) was 1.3 ± 0.09. Twinning rate for SPP, MPP, and LPP was 20%, 73%, and 43%, respectively. Pregnancy rate in SPP ewes may indicate carryover of the suppressive effects of lactation and suckling. Results suggest a lamb to ram interval of &gt;100 d is sufficient for response to the ram effect and resumption of estrous cycles in a majority of ewes during photoperiod of 13L:11D. We conclude Dorper sheep have the reproductive capacity to successfully meet the production goals of accelerated lambing systems and thus, the potential for optimized lamb production.","http://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/97/Supplement_3/450/31255051/skz258.887.pdf",""

Calves were assessed for BRD signs daily from d 0 to 306 according to the DART system. Blood samples were collected and BW recorded on d -15, 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 180. Hot carcass weight was recorded upon slaughter, and carcass quality assessed after a 24-h chill. No treatment effects were detected (P ≥ 0.49) for BW gain and carcass traits (P ≥ 0.32). Incidence of BRD (d 0 to 306) was lessened (P < 0.01) in EARLY vs. CON and DELAYED, and similar (P = 0.17) between CON and DELAYED. Treatment × day interactions were detected (P ≤ 0.02) for serum antibody titers against bovine herpesvirus-1, bovine viral diarrhea virus-1, parainfluenza3, and bovine respiratory syncytial virus, which were greater (P ≤ 0.05) in EARLY vs. CON and DELAYED upon feedyard entry. Hence, anticipating initial and booster vaccination against respiratory pathogens to provide both doses prior to shipping appears to be a valid strategy to enhance cattle health responses and mitigate BRD in feedyards.","http://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/97/Supplement_1/39/29014627/skz053.089.pdf",""

We have identified transposable element activation as a key mediator of neurodegeneration in tauopathies, a group of disorders that are pathologically defined by deposits of tau protein in the brain. Cellular defenses that limit transposable element mobilization include 1) formation of silencing heterochromatin and 2) generation of piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) that clear transposable element transcripts. Using genetic approaches in Drosophila models of tauopathy, we find evidence for a causal relationship between tau-induced heterochromatin decondensation and piRNA depletion, transposable element mobilization, and neurodegeneration. 3TC, an FDA-approved inhibitor of reverse transcriptase, suppresses transposable element mobilization and neuronal death in tau transgenic Drosophila. We detect a significant increase in transcripts of the human endogenous retrovirus class of transposable elements in postmortem human Alzheimer’s disease brains.

Despite all the advantages, such as easier operation, less bleeding, and shorter post-surgery recovery time, side effects including sticking, charring, and rebleeding, often occur, leading to increased operation time and sometimes complications that are potentially fatal. Tissue impedance during the electrosurgical procedure has been used to improve the surgical outcome However, this method has only been effective for small-diameter vessels of 3–5 mm. Overall, little is found in literature on dynamic impedance monitoring of blood vessel sealing using bipolar electrosurgical devices. In this study, an experimental setup was designed and built to perform vessel sealing tests on large-diameter blood vessels with mimicking blood flow. Ex vivo porcine carotid artery samples with a diameter about 7 mm were used. Burst pressures after sealing were measured. It was found that the tissue impedance started with an initial decrease, followed by a rapid increase, and ended with a plateau that was orders of magnitude higher than the initial impedance. The rapid increase of impedance provides indication of protein denaturing, thus the seal completion. This feature was used to monitor the electrosurgical vessel sealing process. It is shown that a burst pressure at least twice the normal human systolic blood pressure can be achieved with heating until the maximum tissue impedance is reached. A FEA model was developed in COMSOL to understand the dynamic impedance behavior in the vessel sealing process.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/MSEC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/MSEC2019-3033/6456527/v001t05a011-msec2019-3033.pdf",""

Since carbonate reservoirs are often naturally fractured, fractures should be modeled for realistic acidizing operations. We present adaptive enriched Galerkin (EG) methods to simulate acidizing in fractured carbonate reservoirs. We adopt a two-scale continuum model for the acid transport. The coupled flow and reactive transport systems are spatially discretized by EG methods. Fractures are introduced using local grid refinement (LGR) technique. Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is implemented around wormhole interfaces. Simulation results show that acidizing in fractured carbonate reservoirs is largely dependent on the fracture system while acidizing in unfractured carbonate reservoirs is mainly determined by operation parameters such as acid injection rate. Computationally, the proposed EG scheme has less numerical dispersion and grid orientation effects than standard cell center finite difference/volume methods. AMR is very efficient to track the wormhole growth and speed up acidizing simulations.","http://onepetro.org/spersc/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/193862-MS/1164178/spe-193862-ms.pdf",""

These land use changes are impacting jurisdictional streams, and thus require compensatory stream mitigation via environmental restoration. In this article, we first characterize current demand and supply for stream mitigation for the entire state of Colorado. Second, we assess future demand by forecasting and mapping the lengths of streams that will likely be impacted by specific development and land use changes. Third, based on our interviews with experts, stakeholders, resource managers, and regulators, we provide insight on how regulatory climate, challenges, and water resource developments may influence demand for stream mitigation. From geospatial analyses of permit data, we found that there is currently demand for compensatory stream mitigation in 13 of the 89 HUC-8 watersheds across Colorado. Permanent riverine impacts from 2012–2017 requiring compensatory mitigation totaled 38,292 linear feet (LF). The supply of stream mitigation credits falls well short of this demand. There has only been one approved stream mitigation bank in Colorado, supplying only 2539 LF credits. Based on our analyses of future growth and development in Colorado, there will be relatively high demand for stream mitigation credits in the next 5–10 years. While most of these impacts will be around the Denver metropolitan area, we identified some new areas of the state that will experience high demand for stream mitigation. Given regulatory agencies’ stated preference for mitigation banks, the high demand for stream mitigation credits, and the short supply of stream credits, there should be an active market for stream mitigation banks in Colorado. However, there are some key obstacles preventing this market from moving forward, with permanent water rights’ acquisitions at the top of the list. Ensuring stream mitigation compliance is essential for restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of stream systems in Colorado and beyond.","https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/11/1/174/pdf",""

Whether this reflects a causal relationship is unknown. If this association does reflect a causal relationship, the risk of spina bifida should change with changes in maternal BMI. We evaluated the association between spina bifida and maternal change in BMI, assessed using interpregnancy change in BMI (IPC‐BMI). Methods: We used data from the Texas Birth Defects Registry and statewide vital records for 248 spina bifida cases and 2,562 controls (2006–2012) to conduct a case–control study. We used logistic regression to estimate the association between IPC‐BMI and spina bifida, with adjustment for potential confounders. Results: When assessed as a continuous variable, IPC‐BMI was associated with spina bifida, with a 5% increase in the odds of spina bifida per unit (approximately 6 pounds) increase in BMI (adjusted odds ratios [aOR] = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.09). When assessed as a categorical variable, with weight stable women as the referent, the odds of spina bifida were lower in women with any BMI decrease (aOR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.50, 1.08) and higher in women with an increase of ≥1 BMI units (aOR = 1.17, 95% CI: 0.85, 1.62). Conclusions: Our findings provide suggestive, although not conclusive, evidence that maternal prepregnancy change in BMI, assessed using IPC‐BMI, is associated with spina bifida in the later pregnancy. Additional studies aimed at confirming this association and further strengthening the evidence for a causal relationship between spina bifida and maternal BMI are needed.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fbdr2.1547",""

However, it could yield the opposite DNP effect when samples are doped with small EPR width free radicals. Herein, we have investigated the influence of solvent deuteration on the 13C nuclear and electron relaxation that go along with the effects on 13C DNP intensities at 3.35 T and 1.2 K. For 13C DNP samples doped with trityl OX063, the 13C DNP signals decreased significantly when the protons are replaced by deuterons in glycerol:water or DMSO:water solvents. Meanwhile, the corresponding solid-state 13C T1 relaxation times of trityl OX063-doped samples generally increased upon solvent deuteration. On the other hand, 13C DNP signals improved by a factor of ∼1.5 to 2 upon solvent deuteration of samples doped with 4-oxo-TEMPO. Despite this 13C DNP increase, there were no significant differences recorded in 13C T1 values of TEMPO-doped samples with nondeuterated or fully deuterated glassing matrices. While solvent deuteration appears to have a negligible effect on the electron T1 relaxation of both free radicals, the electron T2 relaxation times of these two free radicals generally increased upon solvent deuteration. These overall results suggest that while the solid-phase 13C DNP signals are dependent upon the changes in total nuclear Zeeman heat capacity, the 13C relaxation effects are related to 2H/1H nuclear spin diffusion-assisted 13C polarization leakage in addition to the dominant paramagnetic relaxation contribution of free radical centers.","http://aip.scitation.org/doi/am-pdf/10.1063/1.5096036",""

This study examined the influence of humor and spirituality on resiliency of 156 (age 60 years and older) community-dwelling members of an Osher Lifelong Learning Institute located in the western region of the United States who completed a pen and paper and electronic newsletter surveys. The majority of the sample used humor to cheer themselves when feeling depressed, were amused by the absurdities of life, used humor to feel better and to cope with problems, and believed their humorous outlook prevented them from being upset or depressed. Almost three-quarters of the sample looked to a spiritual force for strength, support, and guidance, 58% worked together with a spiritual force and less than 39% thought about how their lives were part of a larger spiritual force. In the final hierarchical regression model (F (5, 143, = 8.895, p .000), only spirituality (beta = -.238, p &lt; .001) and humor (beta = .444, p &lt; .000) were statistically significant; whereas age, gender and living with another were not statistically significant. The findings suggests that humor along with spirituality are two internal resources that promote resiliency in older adults. Humor infused in informal interactions and planned activities as well as spiritual support may contribute to the promotion and enhancement of resiliency in community-dwelling older adults.","http://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/3/Supplement_1/S940/32999763/igz038.3420.pdf",""

This study involved the estimation of safety performance for rural county roadways (paved and gravel). This was accomplished through the development of safety performance functions (SPFs) to estimate the number of annual crashes at a given highway segment, crash modification factors to determine the impacts associated with various roadway and geometric characteristics, and severity distribution functions (SDFs) to predict the crash severity. County road segment data were collected across a sample of 30 counties representing all regions of Michigan. Because of the overwhelming proportion of deer crashes, only non-deer-related crashes were considered. To minimize the influence of variability among counties, the random effect negative binomial model was used to develop SPFs. In addition, a multinomial logit model was used to develop SDFs. Paved county roadways showed approximately double the crash occurrence rate of typical state-maintained two-lane rural highways, and gravel roadways showed a substantially greater crash occurrence rate than paved county roadways across the equivalent range of traffic volumes. The economic analysis showed that it is beneficial to pave a gravel road when the traffic volume is greater than 600 vehicles per day. The random effect variable is significant in all the calibrated models, which shows that there is a considerable variability among counties that cannot be captured with the available variables. Not considering the random effects will result in biased estimation of crashes.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0361198119850127",""

While public members serving on health care regulatory boards involved with the accreditation, assessment, certification, education, and licensing of physicians provide formal opportunities for voicing public interests, their presence has not been deeply explored. Using 2016 survey and interview data from health care organizations and public members, the authors explore the value and challenges of public members. Public members were often defined as individuals who did not have a background in health care and provided a patient perspective, but in some instances prior health care experience did not automatically exclude these individuals from serving as public members. Public members served on the majority of national health care regulatory boards and constituted an average 9% to 15% of board composition, depending on how rigidly the organizations defined “public member.” Public members were valued for their commitment to the priorities and interests of the public, ability to help boards maintain that public focus, and various professional skills they offer to boards. A main challenge that public members faced was their lack of familiarity with and knowledge of the health care field. The authors suggest several considerations for improved public member integration into health care regulatory organizations: clearly defined roles of public members, including evaluating whether or not previous health care experience either contributes or hinders their role within the organization; greater visibility of opportunities for the public to serve on these boards; and potentially a more intensive orientation for public members.","https://journals.lww.com/00001888-201902000-00019",""

Time-restricted feeding (TRF) is a new approach to combatting many of these diseases; it places an emphasis on when meals are consumed, rather than calorie content. By only manipulating the eating “window,” and without changing the food composition of the diet, research in rodent models has shown promising results that have health implications in people, such as obesity prevention, improved insulin sensitivity, and decreased oxidative stress, inflammation, and cholesterol synthesis. Human trials remain limited and the current data are mixed with regard to TRF and improving health. Present findings suggest the timing of the feeding-fasting window, with feeding taking place in the waking hours and fasting in the evening hours, might offer the greatest benefit for improving cardiometabolic markers. Although additional human trials are needed, TRF might reset and synchronize metabolic “clocks” found throughout the body that are disturbed with obesity, shift work, and frequent eating. Therefore, TRF might offer an effective feeding-fasting paradigm with significant clinical implications for the management and treatment of cardiometabolic diseases observed in individuals in high-stress occupations in the United States and in the US population in general. This review outlines the current rodent and human evidence in these areas and the efficacy of TRF for improving human health.","http://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article-pdf/78/6/459/33202139/nuz090.pdf",""

The trained panel results and WBSF values were analyzed using Proc Means and Proc GLMMIX procedures of SAS (version 9.4, SAS Institute, Cary, NC) with a predetermined α of 5%.ResultsQuality grade impacted flavor for the inside round (P < 0.05). USDA quality grade had minimal effect on tenderness as expected, as beef round cuts are highly active muscles in the animal and contain considerable amounts of connective tissue. Cooking method and internal cook temperature endpoint, or cooking time for the stewing cooking treatment, impacted beef flavor to a greater extent (P < 0.05). When pan fried, thicker cuts resulted in more positive flavor attributes. For cuts that were roasted, cooking to higher internal temperatures resulted in higher levels of beef identity, roasted, and umami flavors and less serumy/bloody flavors, as well as decreased tenderness (P < 0.0001), especially in inside round roasts. Marinated round cuts were more tender than their non-marinated counterparts (P < 0.0001). Cuts that were thinner and had longer cooking times were more tender but had more off-flavor attributes (P < 0.05).ConclusionCut thickness, cooking method, length of cooking or internal cook temperature endpoint, and presence of marinade affected flavor and texture of bottom round, eye of round, and inside round cuts. This data will be useful in providing consumer and food service personnel recommendation on how to maximize the flavor and texture of beef round cuts.","https://www.iastatedigitalpress.com/mmb/article/10720/galley/10244/download/",""

The present work aims to observe the levels of uncertainty in modeling the wake effect by attempting to perform statistical inference of a wake parameter, the wind speed deficit. For this purpose, an uncertainty propagation framework is presented. The framework starts by randomly sampling mean wind speed data from its probability density function (PDF), that is fed an inflow model (TurbSim), resulting in random full-flow fields that are integrated into an aeroelastic model (FAST), which results in the variability of the power and thrust coefficients of a wind turbine. Such coefficients and wind data, finally, fed the wake engineering model (FLORIS). The framework ends with the determination of the 95% coefficient intervals of the time-averaged wind speed deficit. The results obtained for the near and far wake regions introduce fundamentals in estimate the uncertainty in wind speed deficit of a single wind turbine wake and concludes that a systematic uncertainty quantification (UQ) framework for wind turbine wakes may be a useful tool to wind energy projects.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2019-11872/6514109/v013t13a022-imece2019-11872.pdf",""

We hypothesized transporting sedentary horses would yield allied results to studies using transport-conditioned horses. Mature stock-type horses (n = 4) were subjected to three transport durations (0.25, 3 and 6 hours) with 7–8 days between transport. All subjects were transported simultaneously for all durations of transport. Blood samples were collected before, post-transport and 24 hours post-transport and analyzed for complete blood count (CBC). Body weight (BW), rectal temperature (RT), blood glucose (GLU) and blood lactate (BLA) were recorded before and post-transport. All data (p<0.05) were analyzed using PROC MIXED (SAS © 9.4). Transport duration did not influence CBC, BLA or other physical measurements. Resulting GLU increased after 3 (158.5±8.5 mg/ dL) and 6 (147.50±8.5 mg/dL) hours of transport compared to 0.25 hour of transport (117.8±7.2 mg/dL). Weights decreased after transport; however, this was likely due to eliminative behavior during transport. Total WBC tended (P = 0.06) to increase before transport (7.71±0.6 K/µL) than post (5.64±0.59 K/µL) and 24 hours post-transport (6.14±0.06 K/µL). Percent neutrophils (N) increased post-transport (66.8±2.5%) compared to before transport (55.7±2.6%) and 24 hours post-transport (57.2±2.5%). Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (N:L) tended (p= 0.07) to increase post-transport (66.7±2.7%) than before (55.7±2.7%) and 24 hours post-transport (57.3±2.6%) regardless of duration. Increases in N are consistent with previous research indicating a short-term stress response. Previous research measuring adrenocortical response reported elevated N:L ratios indicating stress; our results suggests transport, even minimal, may stimulate a stress response in rarely-transported horses. Elevated GLU after transport may further support an adrenocortical response as cortisol can influence blood glucose concentrations. Findings indicate even short-term transport elicits an immunological stress response and may be intensified in rarely transported horses compared to seasoned travelers.","http://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/97/Supplement_1/31/29014623/skz053.070.pdf",""

Culture results from the lesion within C4 confirmed a diagnosis of Results: Poor response to medical management justified surgical debridment of the lesion in C4 and subsequent stabilization of the cervical vertebral column. A three‐part procedure was performed including (1) debridement of the C4, (2) bilateral ventral vertebral stabilization from C3 to C5, and (3) placement of ampicillin‐impregnated plaster of Paris beads within the body of C4. With postoperative physical rehabilitation, the calf regained full ambulatory function. At 1‐month follow‐up, the calf remained ambulatory with mild proprioceptive ataxia and no evidence of implant failure. At annual recheck, the calf had gained 208 kg and remained fully ambulatory with no residual neurologic deficits. Conclusion: Surgical intervention and use of antibiotic‐impregnated implants offered a viable alternative to long‐term medical management of vertebral osteomyelitis in the calf reported here.

The skin and brain of the three animals as well as the liver of both fish models all exhibit increased inflammation and immune responses; however, the mouse liver suppressed the same pathways.

In this qualitative study, we explored the experiences of a particular group of marginalized women, namely those transitioning out of the sex trade and into legal employment. Study participants included 10 women who have been out of the sex trade from between 3 and 20 years. We found that, in their transition to lawful work, the women began with low job self‐efficacy. Traditional influencers of self‐efficacy were key to aiding their transitions. The most important factor was reflected efficacy, which occurred through their experiences receiving coaching from leaders of the exit‐assistance organizations and employers. This coaching helped the women reframe their skills and attributes gained in the sex trade into employable qualities valued in lawful work. The present study contributes to our understanding of supervisors' roles in helping employees develop self‐efficacy. We conclude with ways in which employers and organizations can aide employment transitions as well as build skills transfer and job self‐efficacy through modes of reflected efficacy and coaching in positive, professional relationships.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hrdq.21382",""

For the discrete controller, we use least-squares estimation method to approximate the Poincaré map on a certain section and use discrete-linear-quadratic-regulator (DQLR) to stabilize a (closed-form) linearization of this map. For the continuous controller, we introduce moving Poincaré sections and stabilize the transverse dynamics along these moving sections. For both controllers, we estimate the region of attraction of the closed-loop system using sum-of-squares methods. Analysis of the impact map yields a refinement of the controller that stabilizes a steady-state walking gait with minimal energy loss. We present both simulation and experimental results that support the validity of the proposed approaches.

Sex hormones are implicated in pain modulation and studies suggest that estradiol increases pain and decreases analgesia. Previous studies have identified that sex differences in descending modulation contribute to dimorphic pain and analgesia. The midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) is a critical brain region for descending inhibition of pain. The PAG projects to the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), which projects to the spinal cord to inhibit pain signals. In addition to pain, this descending system can be activated by endogenous (e.g. endorphins) and/or exogenous (e.g. morphine) substances and sex differences have been reported in the activation of this system during pain and analgesia. Forebrain structures, such as the amygdala, project to and engage the PAG descending circuit, however studies examining forebrain projections to the PAG have been conducted exclusively in males. Further, the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) seems to be involved in pain facilitation, while the medial nucleus (MeA) is involved in pain inhibition. The objective of the present study was to delineate the neural projections from the amygdala to the PAG in the female rat and determine if they are (1) sexually dimorphic in anatomical organization, (2) estradiol‐sensitive, and (3) activated by inflammatory pain. The retrograde tracer fluorogold (FG) was injected into the ventrolateral PAG of adult male (n=4) and female (n=4) Sprague Dawley rats. After 10 days, complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) was injected into the right hind paw to induce inflammatory pain. Twenty‐four hours later, rats were perfusion fixed, brains were sectioned at 25 μm, then processed by immunohistochemistry. Fluorogold was visualized using diaminobenzidine (DAB) oxidation and Fos or estrogen receptor (ERα)was visualized using DAB oxidation in the presence of nickel. Heavy projections from the CeA and MeA to the PAG were observed in females, with a greater number of MeA neurons projecting to the PAG in females than the CeA. Overall, inflammatory pain induced greater Fos expression in the CeA and MeA of males. Interestingly, females had greater Fos expression in CeA‐PAG projection neurons, while in males Fos expression was greater in MeA‐PAG neurons. ERα expression was comparable between the sexes in the CeA, and higher in MeA neurons in females. Together our data indicate that although the MeA‐PAG projection is denser in females, inflammatory pain activates this pathway to a greater degree in males. This suggests that descending inhibition is more ‘engaged’ in males during inflammatory pain. On the other hand, inflammatory pain results in a greater activation of the CeA‐PAG pathway in females, suggesting a pain faciliatory mechanism in females. We are currently using confocal microscopy to determine potential sex differences in the neurochemistry of this system that underlies dimorphic modulation of the PAG during pain.","",""

Consequently, such failures cause the implant not to last as long as required. The uncertainty in design parameters, loading, and even the manufacturing process of femoral stems, makes it important to consider uncertainty quantification and probabilistic modeling approaches instead of the traditional deterministic approach when designing femoral stems. This paper proposes a probabilistic analysis method which considers uncertainties in the design parameters of femoral implants to determine its effect on the implant stiffness. Accordingly, this method can be used to improve the design reliability of femoral stems. A simplified finite element model of a femoral stem was considered and analyzed both deterministically and probabilistically using Monte Carlo simulation. The results showed that uncertainties in design parameters can significantly affect the resulting stiffness of the stem. This paper proposes an approach that can be considered a potential solution for improving, in general, the reliability of hip implants and the predicted stiffness values for the femoral stems so as to better mitigate the stress shielding phenomenon.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/BIOMED/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/DMD2019-3319/5171203/v001t07a006-dmd2019-3319.pdf",""

The study sample was 53.8% female and primarily White (73.6% White, 17.9% Black, and 8.5% Other). Presence and nature of psychotic symptoms, suicidal ideation, and functioning level were assessed through clinician‐administered measures. A series of logistic regressions was performed to assess the contribution of each subtype of psychotic symptom to the presence of suicidal ideation above and beyond age, sex, socio‐economic status, age at bipolar disorder onset, and global level of functioning. Results: Hallucinations overall, delusions of guilt, and number of different psychotic symptom types were uniquely associated with increased odds of suicidal ideation after accounting for covariates. Other forms of delusions (eg, grandiose) and specific types of hallucinations (eg, auditory) were not significantly uniquely associated with the presence of suicidal ideation. Conclusions: Findings of this study suggest the presence of hallucinations as a whole, delusions of guilt specifically, and having multiple concurrent types of psychotic symptoms are associated with the presence of suicidal ideation in children and adolescents with bipolar I disorder.

In fact, uncertainties regarding load conditions, soil and structural properties highly undermine the OWT structural reliability. In this scenario, in order to obtain more accurate results, rigorous probabilistic analyses are necessary. In this study, a probabilistic analysis of the dynamic response of a monopile OWT is conducted by using a systematic uncertainty quantification (UQ) framework to deal with the uncertainty assessment of the model input parameters. The proposed dynamic model computes the dynamic response of the turbine due to wind and waves loads on the monopile structure utilizing a simple cantilever beam analytical model. The distributions of the model input parameters are determined using (1) nonparametric statistics for a large dataset, and (2) the maximum entropy principle for a small dataset. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to propagate the uncertainties of the model inputs and to determine the system reliability expressed in terms of their probability of failure for the serviceability limit state design criterion. Finally, to demonstrate the shortcomings of traditional approaches that assume standard distributions to model uncertainties, a UQ approach modeling the uncertainties of the parameters using normal distributions is contrasted with our framework. From the results, significant differences between the distribution shape and values of the probability of failure can be observed; thus, it demonstrates the importance of developing probabilistic frameworks with systematic UQ to have more realistic approximations of the reliability of the OWT structure.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2019-11862/6514222/v013t13a021-imece2019-11862.pdf",""

However, only little work has been done on using SERS for the detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), primarily due to the challenges associated with fabricating SERS substrates with sufficient hotspots for signal enhancement and with the surface interfacially compatible for the VOCs. This study investigated the phase transfer of Ag-nanospheres (AgNSs) from the aqueous phase to the non-aqueous phase by electrostatic interaction induced by cationic surfactants, and the feasibility of the transferred AgNSs as SERS substrates for the determination of methyl salicylate VOC. Results indicated that one of three cationic surfactants, tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOAB) dissolved in organic solvent showed successful phase transfer of the AgNSs confirmed by several characterization analyses. The complex formed by hydrophobic interaction between the transferred AgNSs and Tenax-TA adsorbent polymer was able to be utilized as a SERS substrate, and the volatile of methyl salicylate could be easily determined from SERS measurements at 4 h static volatile collection. Therefore, the proposed new techniques can be effectively employed to areas where many VOCs relevant to food and agriculture need to be analyzed.","https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/9/11/1621/pdf",""

In this study, we revealed and quantitatively assessed the overall status of prestraining and residual stresses exerted by the epicardial layer on the heart left ventricle (LV). During porcine heart wall dissection, we discovered that bi-layered LV surface strips, consisting of an epicardial layer and cardiac muscle, always curled towards the epicardial side due to epicardial residual stresses. We hence developed a curling angle characterization technique to intuitively and qualitatively reveal the location-dependency and direction-dependency of epicardial residual stresses. Moreover, by combining prestrain measurement and biaxial mechanical testing, we were able to quantify the epicardial prestrains and residual stresses on the unpressurized intact LV. To investigate the potential mechanical effect of epicardial prestraining, a finite-element (FE) model has been constructed, and we demonstrate that it is the prestraining of the epicardial layer, not the epicardial layer alone, providing an additional resistance mechanism during LV diastolic expansion and ventricular wall protection by reducing myocardial stress. In short, our study on healthy, native porcine hearts has revealed an important phenomenon—the epicardial layer, rich in elastin, acts like a prestrained ‘balloon’ that wraps around the heart and functions as an extra confinement and protection interface. The obtained knowledge fills a gap in ventricular biomechanics and will help design novel biomimicking materials or prosthetic devices to target the maintenance/recreation of this ventricle confinement interface.","https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsif.2019.0028",""

One way to address this possibility is by using a behavioral individual differences design. This study examined whether behavioral individual differences in episodic memory abilities predicted adult word learning abilities. If behavioral performance in a nonlinguistic episodic memory task is predictive of behavioral performance in word learning, then it is likely that they share a common underlying nonlinguistic, memory-based mechanism. The results revealed that individual differences in episodic memory abilities predicted word learning abilities shortly after learning but not two days later.

The present study explored associations between cultural humility, moral foundations, political orientation, religious commitment, and xenophobia toward Syrian refugees. Data were collected from adults ( N = 996) in the United States during the 2016 presidential election cycle. Cultural humility was positively correlated with openness to immigration and moral foundations of care and fairness, and inversely related to prejudicial attitudes, perceived real and symbolic threat, and moral foundations of loyalty, authority, and purity. Over and above political identification and religiosity, cultural humility was found to be uniquely associated with more positive attitudes toward Syrian refugees. Additionally, the relationship between the moral foundations of care and fairness and positive attitudes toward refugees was mediated by cultural humility. Findings are discussed in light of the biblical mandate within Christianity to welcome foreigners and advocate for the vulnerable, while balancing compassion with wisdom. In addition to approaching psychological care with refugees through the lens of cultural humility, psychologists have a unique opportunity to advocate for this population through systems-level intervention.

This event plays an important role in both cancerous and normal cell development. Previous studies often assume symmetric methylation on both DNA strands. However, asymmetric methylation, or hemimethylation (methylation that occurs only on 1 DNA strand), does exist and has been reported in several studies. Due to the limitation of previous DNA methylation sequencing technologies, researchers could only study hemimethylation on specific genes, but the overall genomic hemimethylation landscape remains relatively unexplored. With the development of advanced next-generation sequencing techniques, it is now possible to measure methylation levels on both forward and reverse strands at all CpG sites in an entire genome. Analyzing hemimethylation patterns may potentially reveal regions related to undergoing tumor growth. For our research, we first identify hemimethylated CpG sites in breast cancer cell lines using Wilcoxon signed rank tests. We then identify hemimethylation patterns by grouping consecutive hemimethylated CpG sites based on their methylation states, methylation “M” or unmethylation “U.” These patterns include regular (or consecutive) hemimethylation clusters (eg, “MMM” on one strand and “UUU” on another strand) and polarity (or reverse) clusters (eg, “MU” on one strand and “UM” on another strand). Our results reveal that most hemimethylation clusters are the polarity type, and hemimethylation does occur across the entire genome with notably higher numbers in the breast cancer cell lines. The lengths or sizes of most hemimethylation clusters are very short, often less than 50 base pairs. After mapping hemimethylation clusters and sites to corresponding genes, we study the functions of these genes and find that several of the highly hemimethylated genes may influence tumor growth or suppression. These genes may also indicate a progressing transition to a new tumor stage.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1176935119872959",""

Multiparous ewes (n = 414) were randomly assigned to one of four treatments: untreated (U, n = 122), 7 d CIDR (C, n = 97), 7 d CIDR plus P.G. 600 at CIDR removal (CPG0, n = 97), and 7 d CIDR plus P.G. 600 1 d before CIDR removal (CPG-1, n = 98). Rams (n = 15) were joined with ewes immediately after CIDR removal for a 21 d breeding period. Data collected included day of lambing in the lambing season, lambing rate (number of ewes lambing/ewe exposed), and prolificacy (number of lambs/ewe lambing). Lambing season was further divided into the first 10 d and overall. Lambing rate in the first 10 d was greater (P &lt; 0.05) for CPG0 and CPG-1 ewes compared with CIDR ewes, which was greater (P &lt; 0.0001) compared with U ewes. Overall lambing rate increased (P ≤ 0.0001) in all treatments utilizing CIDR compared with U ewes, but no differences (P &gt; 0.76) due to P.G. 600 were detected. Day of lambing was reduced (P ≤ 0.03) for CPG0 and CPG-1 compared with CIDR ewes, which was reduced (P &lt; 0.0001) compared with U ewes (d 10.6, 9.0, 13.4, and 24.4 ± 0.9 for CPG0, CPG-1, CON, and U, respectively). Prolificacy was similar among all treatments both for the first 10 d of the lambing season (P = 0.86) and overall (P = 0.80). The combination of CIDR and P.G. 600 may be beneficial in promoting fewer days to lambing and increasing overall productivity in out of season breeding scenarios.","http://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/97/Supplement_3/144/31256603/skz258.295.pdf",""

Between-within regression analysis of nationally representative longitudinal survey data shows that transitions into cohabitation and parenthood affect depressive symptoms differently for young adults with and without childhood symptoms of ADHD. Specifically, within-person effects indicate that transitions into cohabitation and parenthood are tied to decreases in depressive symptoms, but only for young adults without childhood symptoms of ADHD. In contrast, transitions into marriage are tied to decreases in depressive symptoms, and transitions out of coresidential unions are tied to increases in depressive symptoms, regardless of childhood symptoms of ADHD. The results suggest that some family transitions may work to widen ADHD disparities in depression, underscoring the importance of family contexts for shaping mental health throughout the life course.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2156869319859402",""

Due to the variety of drugs (prescribed and/or illicit) and their various physiological effects on the body, it is difficult for law enforcement to detect/prosecute drug impairment. While blood and urine are typical biological specimens used to test for drugs, oral fluid is an attractive alternative matrix. Drugs are incorporated into oral fluid by oral contamination (chewing or smoking) or from the bloodstream. Oral fluid is non-invasive and easy to collect without the need for a trained professional to obtain the sample, unlike urine or blood. This study analyzes paired oral fluid and urine with drug recognition expert (DRE) observations. Authentic oral fluid samples (n = 20) were collected via Quantisal™ devices from arrestees under an institutional review board-approved protocol. Urine samples (n = 18) were collected with EZ-SCREEN® cups that presumptively screened for Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (cannabinoids), opiates, methamphetamine, cocaine, methadone, phencyclidine, amphetamine, benzodiazepines and oxycodone. Impairment observations (n = 18) were recorded from officers undergoing DRE certification. Oral fluid samples were screened using an Agilent Technologies 1290 Infinity liquid chromatograph (LC) coupled to an Agilent Technologies 6530 Accurate Mass Time-of-Flight mass spectrometer (MS). Personal compound and database libraries were produced in-house containing 64 drugs of abuse. An Agilent 1290 Infinity LC system equipped with an Agilent 6470 Triple Quadrupole MS was used for quantification of buprenorphine, heroin markers (6-acetylmorphine, morphine) and synthetic opioids. Subjects were 23–54 years old; 11 (55%) were male and 9 (45%) were female. Evaluator opinion of drug class was confirmed in oral fluid 90% of time and in urine 85% of the time in reference to scope of testing by the LC–MS methods employed (excludes cannabis and central nervous system depressants). Data indicate that oral fluid may be a viable source for confirming driving under the influence of drugs.","http://academic.oup.com/jat/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jat/bkz075/29400135/bkz075.pdf",""

The second aim was to elicit safety recommendations from the parents of autistic children. Design: Hermeneutic phenomenology. Methods: Fifteen participants who self‐reported they were parents of children with autism were recruited via snowball sampling. Data were collected from September 2017–December 2018 in audiotaped interviews using semi‐structured questions. Interviews were held with four participants to determine if the findings represented their experiences and concerns accurately. Results: Two underlying structures which demonstrated the trajectory of the experience caring for autistic children were lost/finding our way and battle ready/battle weary. The phenomenological themes within battle weary included living with fear, living with uncertainty and living with disappointment. Resilience was a fourth phenomenological theme which supported the experience of being battle ready. The participants provided recommendations for other parents and healthcare professionals to help keep autistic children safe. Conclusion: This study illustrates the unique perspective of parents of autistic children concerning autism and safety. Impact: Most parents in this sample reported they faced substantial issues with safety for their child. Study results demonstrated that parents received little to no information about safety from healthcare professionals. Parents of autistic children and healthcare professionals need to be educated about safety issues to prevent injuries and death.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fjan.14213",""

Methods: We used Texas inpatient discharge diagnoses between 2000 and 2015, restricting to newborns. Between 2000 and 2003, the maximum number of fields for recording diagnostic codes was eight, and between 2004 and 2015 it was 24. Microcephaly was classified into four subgroups based on co‐occurring diagnoses: A (Known Causes), B (Other Birth Defects), C (Preterm Birth or Fetal Growth Restriction) and D (Isolated Cases). Results: We identified 2,301 cases of microcephaly or 4.0 cases per 10,000 live births. There was an increase in the prevalence of microcephaly in 2012–2015 compared with 2000–2003, odds ratio = 1.85 (95% CI 1.64–2.10) Significant temporal increases in microcephaly were observed within each of the four microcephaly subgroups and significant temporal increases were also observed for eight other neonatal diagnoses during the same time period. When we restricted our analysis to cases with microcephaly identified using only the eight diagnostic codes available throughout the entire study period, the temporal trend for microcephaly was diminished or absent. Conclusions: It remains uncertain whether the observed increases in microcephaly and other neonatal diagnoses are real or an artifact of the change in the number of fields. However, since it is unlikely that there would be a simultaneous increase in microcephaly and eight other neonatal diagnoses, it is likely that some or all of the temporal increases in neonatal diagnoses are artifactual.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fbdr2.1491",""

This essay contributes to this central problem of knot making and reading traditions by enlisting the aid of an unlikely source: the memoirs of a mid-nineteenth-century gentleman who was given a striking account of how khipu masters in Cuzco’s countryside recorded specific events of a twelve-month calendar in their khipus and made accurate calculations based on them. The analysis and reconstruction of Cuzco’s calendar-demographic khipus is framed into the history of Catholic catechesis, which included early efforts at colonizing indigenous ways of thinking and experiencing time through tactile, visual, and sonic strategies. This process, rather than marginalizing knotted cords all together, as it is sometimes assumed, turned khipukamayuq into important, yet often overlooked agents for the gradual establishment of the Roman Catholic calendar in Andean rural parishes. Unraveling the basic principles for the accounting of time in these modern khipus by placing them in their historical context is a firm, and to our knowledge unprecedented, step toward future efforts at deciphering both quantitative and qualitative cords with a temporal component.","https://read.dukeupress.edu/ethnohistory/article-pdf/66/3/437/1634729/437delapuente.pdf",""

Among the many relationships that influence children’s growth and development, perhaps the most influential is the one that exists between parent and child. Recognition of the critical importance of early parent-child relationship quality for children’s socioemotional, cognitive, neurobiological, and health outcomes has contributed to a shift in efforts to identify relational determinants of child outcomes. Recent efforts to extend models of relational health to the field of child development highlight the role that parent, child, and contextual factors play in supporting the development and maintenance of healthy parent-child relationships. This review presents a parent-child relational health perspective on development, with an emphasis on socioemotional outcomes in early childhood, along with brief attention to obesity and eating behavior as a relationally informed health outcome. Also emphasized here is the parent–health care provider relationship as a context for supporting healthy outcomes within families as well as screening and intervention efforts to support optimal relational health within families, with the goal of improving mental and physical health within our communities.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1559827619849028",""

This study examines the effects of social influence, network characteristics, and entrepreneurial motivations on trust, reciprocity, and togetherness in a network of wildlife tourism microentrepreneurs. Thirty-seven wildlife tourism microentrepreneurs from North Carolina’s Pamlico Sound Region were recruited for in-person structured interviews. Data were analyzed using social network analysis, specifically a series of linear network autocorrelation models in conjunction with supportive qualitative assessment. Microentrepreneurs expressing a high level of trust were connected with microentrepreneurs expressing a low level of trust in their peers. Conversely, microentrepreneurs with strong feelings of reciprocity were connected with microentrepreneurs having similar feelings. These findings illustrate that the presence of equally reciprocal relationships is not an indication of equally trusting relationships. The findings also suggest that higher numbers of business ties tend to diminish the levels of trust, reciprocity, and togetherness toward connected peers.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1096348019840794",""

A basic untested proposition is that they chronically coexist, and that household water insecurity is a fundamental driver of household food insecurity. Methods: We provide a preliminary assessment of their association using cross‐sectional data from 27 sites with highly diverse forms of water insecurity in 21 low‐ and middle‐income countries across Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and the Americas (N = 6691 households). Household food insecurity and its subdomains (food quantity, food quality, and anxiety around food) were estimated using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale; water insecurity and subdomains (quantity, quality, and opportunity costs) were estimated based on similar self‐reported data. Results: In multilevel generalized linear mixed‐effect modeling (GLMM), composite water insecurity scores were associated with higher scores for all subdomains of food insecurity. Rural households were better buffered against water insecurity effects on food quantity and urban ones for food quality. Similarly, higher scores for all subdomains of water insecurity were associated with greater household food insecurity. Conclusions: Considering the diversity of sites included in the modeling, the patterning supports a basic theory: household water insecurity chronically coexists with household food insecurity. Water insecurity is a more plausible driver of food insecurity than the converse. These findings directly challenge development practices in which household food security interventions are often enacted discretely from water security ones.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ajhb.23309",""

This multimodal laboratory‐based treatment study used an ABA renewal design and an approach–avoidance (AP–AV) task to examine renewal of fear/threat and avoidance in twenty adults. In Context A, 9 visual cues paired with increases in probabilistic money loss (escalating threats) produced increases in ratings of feeling threatened and loss expectancies and skin‐conductance responses (SCR). During the AP–AV task, a monetary reinforcer was available concurrently with threats. Approach produced the reinforcer or probabilistic loss, while avoidance prevented loss and forfeited reinforcement. Escalating threat produced increasing avoidance and ratings. In Context B with Pavlovian extinction, threats signaled no money loss and SCR declined. During the AP–AV task, avoidance and ratings also declined. In a return to Context A with Pavlovian threat extinction in effect during the AP–AV task, renewal was observed. Escalating threat was associated with increasing ratings and avoidance in most participants. SCR did not show renewal. These are the first translational findings to highlight renewal of avoidance in humans. Further research should identify individual difference variables and altered neural mechanisms that may confer increased risk of avoidance renewal.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fjeab.565",""

We present a comparative analysis of NCC estimates for a large herbivore in a dynamic landscape, using models that differ in structure and scope. We compared three model structures across three estimates of winter ranges under three winter-severity scenarios for an isolated, introduced moose Alces alces population on the Copper River Delta of south-central Alaska. Model estimates of NCC ranged from 205 to 4,592 moose, demonstrating the critical influences of model structure and assumptions when applying NCC. Furthermore, population estimates during recent severe winters suggest that past models underestimated NCC on the Copper River Delta. We conducted a sensitivity analysis of a preferred model and determined that model components with the highest and lowest sensitivity were snow depth and lignin- and tannin-caused reductions in forage nutritional quality, respectively. Our low sensitivity values for lignin and tannin influences on NCC contrast with results in other NCC estimates. Overall, our results reinforce the need for, and will hopefully assist, adaptive management in response to landscape, population, behavioral, and climatic changes on the Copper River Delta, and demonstrate the importance of understanding model assumptions and structure in application of NCC estimates in the management of large herbivores in variable ecosystems.","https://meridian.allenpress.com/jfwm/article-pdf/10/1/163/2962278/122017-jfwm-104.pdf",""

Visceral stimulation is a predominant cause of AD in humans and effectively replicates the phenotype in rodent models of SCI. Direct assessment of sympathetic responses to viscerosensory stimulation in spinalized animals is challenging and requires invasive surgical procedures necessitating the use of anesthesia. However, administration of anesthesia markedly affects viscerosensory reactivity, and the effects are exacerbated following spinal cord injury (SCI). Therefore, the major goal of the present study was to develop a decerebrate rodent preparation to facilitate quantification of sympathetic responses to visceral stimulation in the spinalized rat. Such a preparation enables the confounding effect of anesthesia to be eliminated. Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to SCI at the fourth thoracic segment. Four weeks later, renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) responses to visceral stimuli were quantified in urethane/chloralose-anesthetized and decerebrate preparations. Visceral stimulation was elicited via colorectal distension (CRD) for 1 min. In the decerebrate preparation, CRD produced dose-dependent increases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and RSNA and dose-dependent decreases in heart rate (HR). These responses were significantly greater in magnitude among decerebrate animals when compared with urethane/chloralose-anesthetized controls and were markedly attenuated by the administration of urethane/chloralose anesthesia after decerebration. We conclude that the decerebrate preparation enables high-fidelity quantification of neuronal reactivity to visceral stimulation in spinalized rats.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpheart.00724.2018",""

Since the introduction of Western medicine in India as early as the eighteenth century, the two systems of medicine have coexisted and influenced each other. Mutual recognition of the therapeutic values of the two systems was further bolstered when American medicine recognized the role of alternative therapies as viable option for healing in the early eighties. The purpose of this paper is to examine the roles two kinds of healers (western and non- western) play in the Asian Indian Hindu context. For this qualitative study, 30 physicians (trained in Western medicine) and 5 sadhus (holy men) were interviewed in the city of Allahabad, during the Kumbh Mela. Open ended questions ranged from: a) field of practice (physicians), sadhus (mystics), b) years of practice, c) number of patients/followers, d) treatment offered (physician –surgery or medications), sadhus (prayers, fasts, charitable donations), e) adverse reactions. In-depth interviews were recorded and transcribed by two researchers from Hindi to English and coded into themes. Results indicate that about a quarter of Western trained physicians not only sought assistance from the sadhus for their emotional/spiritual issues, but also referred patients with terminal disease. Besides individual consults, the mystics conduct lectures on climate change, on holistic diet, meditation, yoga practices, and healing. Social workers need to assess the value Hindu immigrant families in United States attach to Non-Western therapies.","http://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/3/Supplement_1/S428/33006548/igz038.1602.pdf",""

Sexual violence was measured using the Sexual Experiences Survey (SES), and analysis included both the participant’s risk of experiencing sexual violence and the extent (or total count) of sexual violence experienced. This study poses the following research questions: What effects do gender identity and sexual orientation have on the risk and extent of sexual violence among students and, among victims, what is the relationship between gender identity/sexual orientation and mental health (posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD], depression) and academic environment (disengagement and safety) outcomes for university students? Multilevel, random effect hurdle models captured this sequential victimization dynamic. GSM and cisgender heterosexual (CH) female students are predicted to be 2.6 and 3 times, respectively, as likely to experience sexual violence compared with CH male students. In addition, GSM students experiencing sexual violence are also expected to experience a greater number of sexually violent acts (74% more) over their college career compared with victimized CH male students. The models confirm that the risk of victimization increases over time (13% per year for CH male students), but GSM students are expected to experience an additional (10%) increase in risk of victimization per year compared with CH male students. GSM and CH female students are also predicted to be more likely to have PTSD and experience more severe depression symptoms than CH male students. GSM students are expected to experience significantly higher rates of PTSD, worse depressive symptoms, and greater disengagement than CH female students. The discussion explores how institutions of higher education might recognize the resilience of GSM students and consider the protective potential of social and community support when developing programs or interventions for diverse populations.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0886260519883866",""

Using the testimonies of two survivors of the Holocaust, we sketch the components of a model for a GIS of place that allows for this theory of place to be visualized and analyzed. The model is, crucially, both multi‐scalar and sensitive to uncertainty, as a GIS of place needs to be able to zoom in and out of the different scales at which place is experienced, as well as capture both uncertain data and uncertainty as data. We see potential in the representations proposed for scaling up from the anecdotal to the general in the sense that any narrative can be grouped and classified according to places and scales as shown here. The challenge in developing a GIS of place along the lines we propose here is to design a new set of functionalities that can do so.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Ftgis.12583",""

Triglycerides are the predominate lipid in beef and are considered neutral fatty acids, whereas polar fatty acids are found in the phospholipid portion of beef. Diet of cattle during the finishing period can impact type and saturation of fatty acids in meat.The objective of this research was to evaluate differences in neutral and polar lipid fatty acid content from grass-fed and grain-fed beef of varying quality grades sourced from New Zealand and the United States, respectively.Materials and MethodsBeef strip loins (n = 200) representing two fed cattle types (n = 100/finishing type: grass-finished and grain-finished) and five different USDA quality grades (n = 20 per quality grade: USDA Standard, Select, Low Choice, “Top” Choice: High and Average Choice, and Prime) were acquired from beef processing facilities in New Zealand (grass-fed) and Nebraska (grain-fed). A face steak was cut from the anterior end of each strip loin for fatty acid analysis. Face steaks (n = 200) were frozen and stored at the Gordon W. Davis Meat Science Laboratory until further fabrication. Samples were thawed for 12 to 24 h, trimmed of subcutaneous fat and connective tissue and ground. The ground sample was frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenized for fatty acid analysis. Lipids were extracted, fractionated into neutral lipid (NL) and polar lipid (PL), derivatized to fatty acid methyl esters and determined by gas chromatography.Statistical analyses were conducted using the procedures of SAS (Version 9.3; SAS Inst. Inc., Cary, NC). Treatment comparisons were tested for significance using PROC GLIMMIX with α = 0.05.ResultsInteractions of cattle diet × marbling level affected the overall concentrations (mg/g) of NL saturated fatty acids (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (P < 0.05). Saturated fatty acid and MUFA NL concentration decreased as marbling level decreased, as grain-fed Prime was higher (P < 0.05) than all other treatments. Grain-finished and grass-finished Standard had the lowest (P < 0.05) SFA and MUFA NL concentration compared to all other treatments. Concentration of PUFA NL was higher (P < 0.05) for grain-finished Prime than grain-finished Top Choice and grass-finished Prime. No difference was found between grain-finished Low Choice and Select and grass-finished Top Choice NL concentration (P > 0.05), however all were higher (P < 0.05) than grass-finished and grain-finished Standard and grass-finished Select. A cattle diet × marbling level interaction affected the overall PL concentrations of SFA and MUFA (P < 0.05), but not PUFA (P > 0.05). Generally, polar fatty acid content increased as marbling increased for SFA and MUFA. Grain-finished PUFA PL concentration was higher (P < 0.05) than grass-finished samples. Additionally, PUFA PL concentration increased as quality grade decreased (P < 0.05).ConclusionIn conclusion, polar and neutral fatty acid content increased with increasing quality grades except for PL polyunsaturated fatty acids. Additionally, grain-finished beef steaks generally contained a higher SFA and MUFA NL concentration than grass-finished beef steaks for all quality grades except Low Choice and Top Choice.","https://www.iastatedigitalpress.com/mmb/article/10737/galley/10161/download/",""

Through synthesizing recent quantitative studies of urbanization in criminology, we evaluated this multidimensional framework in a longitudinal, cross-national analysis of homicide rates for 217 countries between 2000 and 2015. For the analysis, we also highlighted the issue of missing data, a common concern for cross-national scholars in a variety of disciplines. While controlling for other relevant factors, we compared results from panel models that use the common technique of listwise deletion (n = 113) and from structural equation models (SEM) that handle missing values with full information maximum likelihood (n = 216). While the estimates for the control variables are non-significant in the SEM approach, the findings for the urbanization variables were robust and multidimensional. In particular, while the proportion of the population that is urban is positively related to homicide, the proportion of the population living in large cities of at least one million inhabitants is significantly and negatively related to homicide in all models. Given our focus on urbanization, we outline our contribution not only in the context of criminology but also the cross-national sustainability literature, which often uses similar variables with missing values.","https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/20/5855/pdf",""

These methods are limited in the sense that the patches are determined by network architecture instead of learned from data. In this work, we propose the dense transformer networks, which can learn the shapes and sizes of patches from data. The dense transformer networks employ an encoder-decoder architecture, and a pair of dense transformer modules are inserted into each of the encoder and decoder paths. The novelty of this work is that we provide technical solutions for learning the shapes and sizes of patches from data and efficiently restoring the spatial correspondence required for dense prediction. The proposed dense transformer modules are differentiable, thus the entire network can be trained. We apply the proposed networks on biological image segmentation tasks and show superior performance is achieved in comparison to baseline methods.","",""

The results suggest that a positive association between vitamin D deficiency and preterm birth exists. However, the findings of the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and preeclampsia were inconclusive, possibly because of the need for supplementation to occur prior to placentation. This may be because of a lack of studies with ethnic minority populations, who are more likely to experience vitamin D deficiency, and inadequate supplementation doses used for treatment of vitamin D deficiency. Health care providers should screen pregnant women at risk for vitamin D deficiency and supplement women accordingly based on their vitamin D status. Lastly, well‐designed and standardized clinical trials need to include large cohorts of minority pregnant women to establish the impact of vitamin D supplementation on improving preterm birth and preeclampsia risk in pregnancy.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jmwh.13014",""

In an effort to reuse a seemingly useless and disposable component of one of America’s most enjoyed aquatic delicacies, our objective was to determine the nutritive value of crawfish and shrimp shells in relation to ruminant nutrition. These discarded items were collected from local events and sorted into four different groups: crawfish heads, crawfish tails, shrimp shells, and shrimp tails. Crawfish and shrimp wastes were tested independent of each other. These groups were dried at 55°C for 72 h and ground to pass through a 2-mm screen. Samples were subjected to a batch-culture in vitro true digestibility (IVTD) assay. A separate set of samples (1 mm) were assayed for dry matter, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF), and acid detergent lignin (ADL; inclusive of residual ash). Data were analyzed as a completely randomized design using the MIXED procedure of SAS. Crawfish heads were assayed to contain 26.2% NDF, 13.4% ADF, and 1.0% ADL, while crawfish tails contained 23.7% NDF, 16.3% ADF, and 1.1% ADL. Crawfish heads and tails did not differ in IVTD (P = 0.48) or in vitro NDF digestibility (IVNDFD; P = 0.13; 76.7 vs. 77.2% and 86.8 vs. 91.0%, respectively). Shrimp shells contained 36.1% NDF, 26.9% ADF, and 4.1% ADL, whereas shrimp tails contained 29.1% NDF, 17.9% ADF, and 0.7% ADL. Shrimp tails had greater (P &lt; 0.01) IVTD (74.2 vs. 66.4%) but lesser (P = 0.01) IVNDFD than shrimp shells (80.6 vs. 85.0%). Results are interpreted to mean that crustacean waste may represent a suitable prospective feedstuff for further evaluation.","http://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/97/Supplement_3/154/31256744/skz258.317.pdf",""

Here, we visualize individual tubulin subunits reversibly and irreversibly interacting with dynamic microtubule tips, and thereby directly measure tubulin plus-tip kinetics. By analyzing plus-tip residence times of wild-type and mutant tubulin, we characterize the relative contributions of longitudinal (along protofilaments) and lateral (between protofilaments) bond energies to microtubule growth.

While past research has examined school-related factors linked to teacher turnover, few studies have examined how external contextual factors are related to teacher turnover. This study examines the role of two external contextual factors in teacher turnover: economic downturns and changes in state curricular policy (the Michigan Merit Curriculum [MMC]). Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: This study asks the extent to which the economic crisis of 2009 and the implementation of the MMC are related to school-level teacher turnover rates and whether those relationships vary by school locale and within the school year. Population/Participants/Subjects: The data include full-time high school teachers in the state of Michigan aggregated to the school level. Research Design: Using eight years of statewide longitudinal data from Michigan, the study employs school fixed effects models to account for possible differences in unobservable school characteristics that are constant over time and may be related to teacher turnover. The study examines teacher turnover at both the mid-year and the end of the year as teachers leave schools at various points during the school year. Additionally, this study considers how turnover is experience differentially by urbanicity. Findings/Results: Between 3.2% and 15.5% of teachers left their school over the eight-year period. The rates of turnover varied by the time of the school year with more teachers leaving at the end of the year than during mid-year. There was a significant increase in teacher turnover rates around the announcement of the MMC as well as the economic downturn. While all locations were impacted by the announcement of the MMC, the largest amount of turnover occurred in urban areas and the lowest for suburban areas. In terms of the economic downturn, towns were impacted the most, followed by rural and suburban schools. Urban areas did not see a significant increase in teacher turnover related to the recession. Conclusions/Recommendations: The authors conclude that external contextual factors are related to increases in teacher turnover independent of each other. How these factors relate to teacher turnover does depend on school locale. While this study was based in Michigan, all states have their own policy and economic pressures to consider in related to school-level decision making and teacher turnover.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/016146811912101106",""

In this meta‐analysis, we compiled and analyzed 900 observations associated with 41 field trials for four switchgrass cultivars (two lowlands, Alamo and Kanlow, and two uplands, Cave‐In‐Rock and Shelter). This extensive dataset and machine learning were used to identify the most influential variables impacting switchgrass productivity, to search for evidence of local adaptation to each cultivar's location of origin, and to predict change in productivity under future climate for each cultivar. In general, variables associated with climate and management are more important predictors of productivity relative to soil variables. Three climatic variables, annual mean temperature, annual precipitation, and precipitation in the wettest month, are identified as key environmental variables for productivity of all cultivars. Productivity under future climate (2041–2060) is predicted to stay stable for all cultivars relative to the prediction under current climate (1986–2005) across all trial locations and over a 20‐year simulation period. However, the productivity of each cultivar varies from location to location and from year to year, although productivity varies more between locations than between years. Additionally, we observe shifts in the most productive cultivar at the local field scale depending on the combination of management practice and climates. The shape of the relationship between productivity and the annual mean temperature relative to the cultivar's location of origin is a bell‐shaped curve for Kanlow, Cave‐in‐Rock, and Shelter, indicative of local adaptation. Identifying influential environmental variables and their relationships to productivity with respect to cultivar's location of origin help predicting productivity on the local field scale, and will help with the biofuel production planning through the selection of suitable cultivars for different locations under climate changes.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fgcbb.12609",""

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that have been traditionally used for detecting specific proteins can also be used as targeting moieties. However, due to their intrinsic characteristics such as immunogenicity, batch-to-batch variation and instability, antibodies have several limitations for in vivo applications. Nucleic acid based aptamers are emerging as attractive alternatives for mAbs. We have developed single-stranded DNA aptamers, which can specifically recognize and bind to ovarian cancer endothelial cells. Using mass-spectroscopy based proteomics, we have identified Annexin A2 as the protein target for the selected aptamers. These aptamers can act as homing devices to deliver therapeutic drugs and/or imaging agents specifically to ovarian cancer cells. Using a highly stable, three-way junction (3WJ) motif from the phi29 packaging RNA as a scaffold, we made a multi-functional RNA nanoparticle that can harbor therapeutic drugs, imaging agent, siRNA and the targeting ligand. The aptamer-containing multi-functional RNA nanoparticle is used to deliver Doxorubicin to Annexin A2 positive ovarian cancer cells, while the control nanoparticles failed to deliver. After systemic injection in mice, the DNA/RNA hybrid nanoparticles remained intact and strongly bound to tumors with little accumulation in healthy organs 6 hour post-injection. The aptamer-3WJ-Sph1/Dox intercalates selectively enhanced toxicity to Annexin A2 positive ovarian cancer cells in vitro, demonstrating the potential of the constructed DNA/RNA hybrid nanoparticles to enhance the therapeutic efficiency of Doxorubicin at low doses for ovarian cancer treatment. The use of the aptamer-3WJ RNA nanoparticle will benefit ovarian cancer patients by reducing the side effects of cancer chemo-therapeutics and increasing its local concentration in the tumor microenvironment after systemic administration. Our ultimate goal is the development of patient-optimized aptamer-nanoparticle delivery systems for chemotherapy and molecular diagnostics imaging.","https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article/25/22_Supplement/NT-112/230597/Abstract-NT-112-APTAMER-CONJUGATED-NANOPARTICLES",""

Seventy-two Angus × Hereford heifers were ranked on day −6 of experiment (17 d after weaning) by age and BW (218 ± 1.6 d of age and 234 ± 3 kg of BW), and assigned to receive 1 of 3 supplementation programs from days 0 to 182: 1) no supplementation to maintain limited BW gain (LGAIN), 2) supplementation to promote moderate BW gain (MGAIN), or 3) supplementation to promote elevated BW gain (HGAIN). Heifers were maintained in 2 pastures (36 heifers/pasture, 12 heifers/treatment in each pasture) with free-choice alfalfa-grass hay, and supplements were offered individually 6 d per week. Heifer shrunk BW was recorded on days −6 and 183 for average daily gain (ADG) calculation. Blood samples were collected for puberty evaluation via plasma progesterone weekly from days 0 to 182. On day 183, heifers were combined into a single group and received the same nutritional management until the end of the experimental period (day 718). From days 183 to 253, heifers were assigned to a fixed-time artificial insemination program combined with natural service. Average daily gain from days 0 to 182 was greater (P < 0.01) in HGAIN vs. MGAIN and LGAIN (0.78, 0.60, and 0.37 kg/d, respectively; SEM = 0.02), and greater (P < 0.01) in MGAIN vs. LGAIN heifers. Puberty attainment by the beginning of the breeding season was also greater in HGAIN vs. MGAIN and LGAIN (87.5%, 62.5%, and 56.5%, respectively; SEM = 7.1) but similar (P = 0.68) between MGAIN vs. LGAIN heifers. A treatment × day interaction was detected (P < 0.01) for calving rate, as HGAIN heifers calved earlier compared with MGAIN and LGAIN heifers. Ten heifers per treatment were assessed for milk production via weigh-suckle-weigh at 56.8 ± 1.5 d postpartum, followed by milk sample collection 24 h later. No treatment differences were detected (P ≥ 0.16) for milk yield and composition. However, mRNA expression of GLUT1 in milk fat globules was less (P ≤ 0.02) in LGAIN vs. MGAIN and HGAIN heifers, and expression of GLUT8 mRNA was also less (P = 0.04) in LGAIN vs. HGAIN heifers. No treatment differences were detected (P ≥ 0.44) for offspring weaning BW. Collectively, results from this experiment indicate that HGAIN hastened the reproductive development of replacement heifers, without negatively affecting their milk productivity and offspring weaning weight as primiparous cows.","http://academic.oup.com/jas/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jas/skz262/30036635/skz262.pdf",""

Ampicillin (AMP), ceftaroline (CPT), and ertapenem (ERT) have the best synergism. Using a DAP tolerant strain (503; DAP MIC 2 µg/mL) of Efm, we previously showed that AMP, CPT, and ERT combined with DAP were effective in reducing bacterial loads and prevented emergence of resistance in a simulated endocardial vegetation model. However, against a DAP-R Efm strain (R497, DAP MIC of 16 µg/mL), CPT, ERT failed to synergize with DAP. Here, we dissect the mechanistic basis of the differing DAP plus β-lactam synergistic effect. Methods: We performed comparative transcriptional profiling of pbp genes in Efm 503 vs. R497 using qRT–PCR. PBP5 protein levels were assessed by immunoblotting. The β-lactam-binding affinity of PBPs was quantified with bocillin-FL staining and SDS–PAGE. PBP5 sequences of Efm Com15 (AMP and DAP-susceptible strain) and clinical strains S447, 503 and R497 (all with AMP MIC > 256 µg/mL) were compared in silico to identify amino acid (AA) differences in key protein sites which were verified with sequencing Results: Pbp gene transcripts and PBP5 amounts were similar between 503 vs. R497. Interestingly, bocillin SDS–PAGE showed increased β-lactam binding affinity in PBP5 of 503 compared with that of R497 and S447. PBP5 sequences of S447 and R497 were identical. All three clinical strains had classic mutations (M485A and 466’S) important for high-level AMP-R. However, 503 had additional substitutions in the transpeptidase domain (H408Q, A462V, T546N, T558A, S582G, V586L) and penicillin-binding domain (Q632K, L642P) compared with R497 and S447. The latter AA sequences in 503 are common to AMP-susceptible Efm strains Conclusion: We uncovered that a “hybrid” pbp5 allele of 503 (DAP-tolerant) correlated with synergism of DAP plus AMP, CPT or ERT and was associated with increased PBP5 β-lactam binding affinity. Lack of synergism of DAP plus CPT or ERT is associated with specific PBP amino acids in the transpeptidase and penicillin-binding domains. Thus, pbp5 alleles are major determinants of the DAP plus β-lactam synergistic effect and could be used as a diagnostic tool to guide therapy in recalcitrant Efm infections Disclosures: All authors: No reported disclosures.","http://academic.oup.com/ofid/article-pdf/6/Supplement_2/S287/30272048/ofz360.683.pdf",""

Postmortem metabolism (muscle-to-meat conversion) affects biochemical properties of muscles and in turn influence the meat quality. Although previous research has indicated that variation in the proteome profile of LL and PM post-rigor influences meat quality attributes such as tenderness and color stability during retail display, limited research has examined the influence of early postmortem metabolism on meat quality. Tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling is a chemical labeling approach used for accurate mass spectrometry-based quantification and identification of biological macromolecules. Therefore, the objective of this study was to use TMT labeling to examine proteome profile variation between beef LL and PM during the early postmortem period.Materials and MethodsMuscle biopsy samples were collected from carcasses (n = 4) at 45 min, 12 h, and 36 h postmortem from a commercial beef processing facility. Samples were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80°C until proteomic analysis. Proteome was analyzed using TMT label containing ten different isobaric compounds with the same mass and chemical structure composed of an amine-reactive NHS-ester group, a spacer arm, and a mass reporter. After labeling and peptide fractionation, all the samples were multiplexed and ran through the Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer equipped with a Nanospray Flex ion source to identify differentially abundant proteins. The proteins exhibiting 1.5-fold or more intensity difference and a statistical difference (P < 0.05) between LL and PM or within the muscles during the postmortem were reported as differentially abundant.ResultsSeventy differentially abundant proteins (P < 0.05) were identified from three comparisons between the muscles (31 proteins in PM 45 min vs. LL 45 min, 41 proteins in PM 12 h vs. LL 12 h, 49 proteins in PM 36 h vs. LL 36 h). However, no difference (P > 0.05) in protein expression within a muscle was observed during these time points. The differentially abundant proteins were mainly involved in oxidative phosphorylation and ATP-related transport, tricarboxylic acid cycle, NADPH regeneration, fatty acid degradation, muscle contraction, calcium signaling, chaperone activity, oxygen transport, as well as degradation of the extracellular matrix. At early postmortem, overabundant anti-apoptotic proteins in LL could cause high metabolic stability, enhanced autophagy, and delayed apoptosis, while overabundant metabolic enzymes and pro-apoptotic proteins in PM could accelerate the reactive oxygen species generation and programmed cell death.ConclusionDifferentially abundant proteins between LL and PM during the early postmortem were primarily associated with cellular metabolism and programmed cell death. The greater oxidative and color stability in LL compared to PM could be related to the increased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins and the decreased expression of metabolic enzymes and proapoptotic proteins in LL.","https://www.iastatedigitalpress.com/mmb/article/10681/galley/10290/download/",""

One group (TX; n = 48) was shipped to New Deal, Texas and fed on slatted-concrete floors, and the second group (SD; n = 48), was shipped half-way to Texas, returned to the RNC, and fed on solid-concrete floors. Transit distance was 1,530 km. Pen was the experimental unit (6 to 8 head·pen-1); diets, health management, and implant programs were normalized across locations. The finishing diet was fed from d 33 to 185 at both locations and the energetics assessment was for the period from d 60 to 185. There were 18 d below -7.8°C and 102 d below 5°C in SD. Transit shrink, estimated empty body fat % (EBF), BW adjusted to 28% EBF (AFBW), and DMI did not differ (P ≥ 0.10). Heifer ADG was 18% greater (P < 0.05) in TX (1.40 vs. 1.16 ± 0.037 kg).

The estimated metabolic rate was elevated (P < 0.05) for SD heifers (0.077 vs. 0.101 ± 0.0031 Mcal/MBS). These results indicate that heifers fed in South Dakota had a 31% increase in metabolic rate when compared to heifers fed in the Texas panhandle.

But does such information provide an accurate portrayal of the natural world? We review the many types of bias and error intrinsic to museum collection data and consider how these factors may affect their ability to accurately test ecological hypotheses. Evidence: We considered all Texas land snail collections from the two major repositories in the state and compared them with an ecological sample drawn across the same landscape. We found that museum collection localities were biased in favour of regions with higher human population densities and iconic destinations. They also tended to be made during attractive temporal windows. Small, uncharismatic taxa tended to be under‐collected while larger, charismatic species were over‐collected. As a result, for most species it was impossible to use museum lot frequency to accurately predict frequency and abundance in an ecological sample. Species misidentification rate was approximately 20%, while 4% of lots represented more than one species. Errors were spread across the entire shell size spectrum and were present in 75% of taxonomic families. Contingency table analysis documented significant dependence of both misidentification and mixed lot rates upon shell size and family richness. Conclusion: Researchers should limit their use of museum record data to situations where their inherent biases and errors are irrelevant, rectifiable or explicitly considered. At the same time museums should begin incorporating expert specimen verification into their digitization programs.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/geb.12995",""

Objectives: To describe results of histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and clonality testing of endoscopically‐derived biopsy specimens of the upper small intestinal tract from a cohort of clinically healthy client‐owned cats. Animals: Twenty clinically healthy client‐owned cats ≥3 years of age. Methods: Tissue specimens were collected from the stomach and duodenum and evaluated single blinded by a board‐certified pathologist. In addition, samples were evaluated by routine immunohistochemistry and clonality testing. Cats were followed after the procedure for signs of CE. Results: Integrated results from histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and clonality testing were interpreted as consistent with small cell lymphoma (SCL; n = 12), emerging SCL (n = 1), lymphocytic enteritis (n = 6), and pseudoclonality (n = 1). On follow‐up, 3 cats eventually developed clinical signs of CE, of which 2 were euthanized 295 and 654 days post‐endoscopy. The remaining 17 cats did not show clinical signs of CE after a median of 709 days (range, 219‐869 days).

GenX is one of several chemistries developed as an alternative to long‐chain poly‐fluoroalkyl substances, which tend to have long clearance half‐lives and are environmentally persistent. Unlike poly‐fluoroalkyl substances, GenX has more rapid clearance, but has been detected in US and international water sources. There are currently no federal drinking water standards for GenX in the USA; therefore, we developed a non‐cancer oral reference dose (RfD) for GenX based on available repeated dose studies. The review of the available data indicate that GenX is unlikely to be genotoxic. A combination of traditional frequentist benchmark dose models and Bayesian benchmark dose models were used derive relevant points of departure from mammalian toxicity studies. In addition, deterministic and probabilistic RfD values were developed using available tools and regulatory guidance. The two approaches resulted in a narrow range of RfD values for liver lesions observed in a 2‐year bioassay in rats (0.01–0.02 mg/kg/day). The probabilistic approach resulted in the lower, i.e., more conservative RfD. The probabilistic RfD of 0.01 mg/kg/day results in a maximum contaminant level goal of 70 ppb. It is anticipated that these values, along with the hazard identification and dose‐response modeling described herein, should be informative for risk assessors and regulators interested in setting health‐protective drinking water guideline values for GenX.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fjat.3812",""

Whole body vibration (WBV) has been shown to elicit adaptive responses in the skeleton, such as increased bone mass and strength. This experiment was designed to determine the effects of WBV and dietary Ca and P on bone microarchitecture and turnover. A total of 26 growing pigs were utilized in a 60-d experiment. Pigs were randomly assigned within group to a 2 × 2 factorial design with dietary Ca and P concentration (low and adequate) as well as WBV. The adequate diet was formulated to meet all nutritional needs according to the NRC recommendations for growing pigs. Low Ca, P diets had 0.16% lower Ca and 0.13% lower P than the adequate diet. Pigs receiving WBV were vibrated 30 min/d, 3 d/wk at a magnitude of 1 to 2 mm and a frequency of 50 Hz. On days 0, 30, and 60, digital radiographs were taken to determine bone mineral content by radiographic bone aluminum equivalency (RBAE) and serum was collected to measure biochemical markers of bone formation (osteocalcin, OC) and bone resorption (carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks, CTX-I). At day 60, pigs were euthanized and the left third metacarpal bone was excised for detailed analysis by microcomputed tomography (microCT) to measure trabecular microarchitecture and cortical bone geometry. Maximum RBAE values for the medial or lateral cortices were not affected (P > 0.05) by WBV. Pigs fed adequate Ca and P tended (P = 0.10) to have increased RBAE max values for the medial and lateral cortices. WBV pigs had significantly decreased serum CTX-1 concentrations (P = 0.044), whereas animals fed a low Ca and P diet had increased (P < 0.05) OC concentrations. In bone, WBV pigs showed a significantly lower trabecular number (P = 0.002) and increased trabecular separation (P = 0.003), whereas cortical bone parameters were not significantly altered by WBV or diet (P > 0.05). In summary, this study confirmed the normal physiological responses of the skeleton to a low Ca, P diet. Interestingly, although the WBV protocol utilized in this study did not elicit any significant osteogenic response, decreases in CTX-1 in response to WBV may have been an early local adaptive bone response. We interpret these data to suggest that the frequency and amplitude of WBV was likely sufficient to elicit a bone remodeling response, but the duration of the study may not have captured the full extent of an entire bone remodeling cycle.","http://academic.oup.com/jas/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jas/skz189/28897543/skz189.pdf",""

The purpose of this study is to examine the association between family cohesion, acculturation, and self-rated health among older Chinese Americans. Data came from a survey of 385 Chinese Americans aged 55 and older living in a large metropolitan area in Southwest America through face-to-face interviews. We used logistic regression to examine the association between acculturation, family cohesion, and self-reported health. In general, acculturation was significantly associated with higher odds of reporting excellent or good health after adjusting for demographic and psychosocial covariates; however, the association between acculturation and self-reported health differed by family cohesion. We found that acculturation was positively associated with self-reported health only among those with medium or high family cohesion, but not among those with low family cohesion. Findings highlighted the significance of involving family members and strengthening family support for providing acculturation services, such as language class and healthy literacy education, to older Americans.

Few sociological studies explore women's work relationships with other women. Our article summarizes existing research from several disciplines on women's working relationships with other women. Specifically, three themes about the conditions of work emerge that discourage women's support for other women: (a) negative stereotypes about women, (b) lack of recognition of gender inequality, and (c) the devaluation of women's relationships, groups, and networks. We assert that these conditions reinforce essentialized notions of women, ignore larger structural inequalities at work, and cast women as the primary culprit in perpetuating gender inequality at work. We conclude with promising areas for future research on women's working relationships with other women.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/soc4.12698",""

Because glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide, it is imperative to study ZIKV infection in causing glaucoma to identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention. In this study, we discovered that ZIKV permissively infects human TM cells and evokes inflammatory responses causing trabeculitis.

Alzheimer’s is a disease for which there is no cure. Diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) early facilitates family planning and cost control. The purpose of this study is to predict the presence of AD using socio-demographic, clinical, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Early detection of AD enables family planning and may reduce costs by delaying long-term care. Accurate, non-imagery methods also reduce patient costs. The Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-1) cross-sectional MRI data were analyzed. A gradient boosted machine (GBM) predicted the presence of AD as a function of gender, age, education, socioeconomic status (SES), and a mini-mental state exam (MMSE). A residual network with 50 layers (ResNet-50) predicted the clinical dementia rating (CDR) presence and severity from MRI’s (multi-class classification). The GBM achieved a mean 91.3% prediction accuracy (10-fold stratified cross validation) for dichotomous CDR using socio-demographic and MMSE variables. MMSE was the most important feature. ResNet-50 using image generation techniques based on an 80% training set resulted in 98.99% three class prediction accuracy on 4139 images (20% validation set) at Epoch 133 and nearly perfect multi-class predication accuracy on the training set (99.34%). Machine learning methods classify AD with high accuracy. GBM models may help provide initial detection based on non-imagery analysis, while ResNet-50 network models might help identify AD patients automatically prior to provider review.","https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/9/9/212/pdf",""

Natural fractures provide effective connections throughout the reservoir, which make naturally fractured reservoirs great candidates for steam injection. Numerical simulators are capable of designing CSI operations in dual-porosity systems. However, the use of commercial simulator can be time-consuming when a large number of cases are examined for optimizations.

Spatial aspects refer to the location of different sites and are usually characterized by the distance between different points and directions by which they are related to each other. We focus on spatial lag and error, spatial eigenvector-based, geographically weighted regression, and spatial-stream-network-based models. We evaluated different studies using these methods based on how they dealt with clustering (spatial autocorrelation) of response variables, incorporated those clustering in the error (residual spatial autocorrelation), used multi-scale processes, and improved the model performance. The water-quality-based regression modeling approaches are shifting from straight-line distance-based spatial relations to upstream–downstream relations. Calculation of spatial autocorrelation and residual spatial autocorrelation was dependent upon the type of spatial regression used. The weights matrix is used as available in the software and most of the studies did not attempt to modify it. Different scale processes like certain distance from rivers versus consideration of entire watersheds are dealt with separately in most of the studies. Generally, the capacity of the predictor variables to predict the response variable significantly improves when spatial regressions are used. We identify new research directions in terms of spatial considerations, weights matrix construction, inclusion of multi-scale processes, and identification of predictor variables in such models.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0309133319852003",""

The objectives of this study are to examine the prevalence of physical TDV, suicidal ideation, suicide plan, and suicide attempt among adolescents aged 14 to 18 years and the association between physical TDV and these suicidal behaviors. Data for this study were obtained from the 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Survey. A sample of 9,693 adolescents aged 14 to 18 years (50.4% males) was analyzed using logistic regression with suicidal ideation, suicide plan, and suicide attempt as outcome variables and physical TDV as the main explanatory variable. About 17% of the adolescent students experienced suicidal ideation, 13.7% made a suicide plan, and 7.6% attempted suicide during the past 12 months. Among those who were dating, 9.9% experienced physical TDV. In the multivariate logistic regression, adolescent students who experienced physical TDV were 1.92 times more likely to have experienced suicidal ideation, 1.67 times more likely to have made a suicide plan, and 2.42 times more likely to have attempted suicide during the past 12 months when compared with their counterparts who were dating but experienced no physical TDV. Other significant predictors of suicidal behaviors include being a sexual minority, experiencing forced sex, bullying, feeling sad or hopeless, and binge drinking. Having sufficient sleep lowered the odds of suicidal ideation and suicide plan. The topic of physical TDV and its association with suicidal behaviors among adolescents is such an important issue for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners in the United States and around the world. Prevention and intervention efforts should be culturally tailored to reflect the unique experiences with physical TDV and suicide among minority populations such as sexual minority adolescents.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0886260519860087",""

These changes include improved thinking by detectives to reduce investigative errors, increased focus on patterns of crimes, and better use of detective expertise in crime prevention. Policy Implications: First, police should work to reduce investigative failures by improving investigative thinking. Second, tinkering with the administrative practices of investigative units seems unlikely to produce significant results. Third, police agencies should engage detectives in crime prevention.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Self-Description Questionnaire I (SDQI) with regard to children’s mathematics self-concept based on the item response theory (IRT) framework. The researchers adopted the IRT-based techniques for uncovering item-level characteristics including discrimination ( a parameter) and thresholds ( b parameters). The data for this study were drawn from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998–99 (ECLS-K) with a sample of 14,631 children. The IRT-based evaluations suggest that the SDQI items have sufficient discrimination, but insufficient item thresholds in assessing third- and fifth-graders’ mathematics self-concept. Thus, it is recommended that the current SDQI be reconsidered for its age appropriateness. In addition, affective items, which involve enjoyment, liking, and positive emotions, are found to be better indicators of self-concept than cognitive items, which involve perceived competence, ability beliefs, and self-efficacy. Results also indicate the presence of item parameter drift (IPD) in all SDQI items, suggesting beta change of the scale over time – children become more sensitive to the response anchors as they grow older. Findings of this study provide insights into the conceptualization and operationalization of academic self-concept, as well as practical implications for future use and development of self-concept measures.","https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/pdf/10.1027/1015-5759/a000473",""

Left ventricular blood flow patterns with areas of flow stasis and recirculation are associated with platelet aggregation, which is worsened by exposure to high shear stress. Previous reports of intraventricular thrombus in LVAD patients have identified the outside of the LVAD inflow cannula as a nidus for LV thrombus formation. Previous studies of LVAD inflow cannula design have shown a region of low blood velocity and pulsatility at the apex, adjacent to the cannula. One unresolved question is whether the standard practice of inserting the LVAD inflow cannula several mm into the LV could be revised to reduce thrombus formation. To address this, a “tipless” inflow cannula was designed for the EVAHEART LVAS, and assessed in a mock circulatory loop of the LVAD‐supported heart. Customized transparent silicone models of a dilated LV were connected to the EVAHEART LVAS at the apex with a clear polycarbonate inflow cannula for flow visualization using particle image velocimetry (PIV). The “tipless” cannula was inserted flush with the endocardial border and did not protrude into the LV. This condition was compared to the standard cannula position with a 1‐cm insertion into the LV. The Pre‐LVAD condition corresponded to a severe heart failure patient (ejection fraction of 24%) with a dilated LV (180 mL). LVAD support was provided at speeds of 1.8 and 2.3 krpm. At the lower LVAD speed, 63% of the flow passed through the LVAD, with the remainder ejecting through the aortic valve. When LVAD speed was increased, nearly all flow (98%) left the LV through the LVAD. Both LVAD speed conditions produced a vortex ring similar to the Pre‐LVAD condition in diastole. However, the protruding inflow cannula interrupted the growth and restricted the movement of the vortex, and produced areas of low velocity and pulsatility adjacent to the cannula. The tipless cannula exhibited an uninterrupted pattern of the mitral jet toward the LV apex, which allowed the diastolic vortex to grow and aid in the washout of this region. In addition, the tipless cannula increased aortic valve flow, which reduces stasis in the left ventricular outflow tract. The EVAHEART LVAS tipless inflow cannula design improved regional velocity, pulsatility, and vortex formation compared to the standard protruding design, which all reduce the risk of thrombus formation. The clinical significance of the differences observed in the flow field will be dependent on other factors such as the cannula material and surface characteristics, as well as the patients' coagulation status.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Faor.13477",""

Previous research suggests that the presence of multiple distinct cancer clones is associated with clinical outcome. Detection of clonal heterogeneity from high throughput data, such as sequencing or single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array data, is important for gaining a better understanding of cancer and may improve prediction of clinical outcome or response to treatment. Here, we present a new method, CloneSeeker, for inferring clinical heterogeneity from sequencing data, SNP array data, or both. Results: We generated simulated SNP array and sequencing data and applied CloneSeeker along with two other methods. We demonstrate that CloneSeeker is more accurate than existing algorithms at determining the number of clones, distribution of cancer cells among clones, and mutation and/or copy numbers belonging to each clone. Next, we applied CloneSeeker to SNP array data from samples of 258 previously untreated CLL patients to gain a better understanding of the characteristics of CLL tumors and to elucidate the relationship between clonal heterogeneity and clinical outcome. We found that a significant majority of CLL patients appear to have multiple clones distinguished by copy number alterations alone. We also found that the presence of multiple clones corresponded with significantly worse survival among CLL patients. These findings may prove useful for improving the accuracy of prognosis and design of treatment strategies.

On day 0, 60, at weaning, prior to feedlot shipping, and during the feedlot period, blood samples were collected and longissimus muscle (LM) biopsies were collected. On day 60, steers that received CSSO during CF had greater (P < 0.01) plasma concentrations of linoleic and ω-6 compared with CON (CF treatment × day; P ≤ 0.05). Steers that received CSSO during PC had greater (P < 0.01) plasma concentrations of linoleic, ω-6, and total fatty acids compared with CON at feedlot shipping (PC treatment × day; P ≤ 0.05). A PC treatment × day interaction was also detected (P = 0.04) for mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), which was greater (P = 0.04) at feedlot shipping for steers receiving CSSO during PC. Interactions between CF treatment × day were detected (P ≤ 0.01) for mRNA expression of adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein, fatty acid synthase, PPAR-γ, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase, which were greater (P ≤ 0.02) in the feedlot in steers receiving CSSO during CF. No treatment differences were detected for (P ≥ 0.18) performance or carcass traits, including marbling and backfat thickness. Results from this study suggest that supplementing CSSO to suckled beef steers via creep-feeding upregulated mRNA expression of the adipogenic genes investigated herein later in life. These outcomes, however, were not translated into improved carcass quality.","http://academic.oup.com/jas/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jas/skz272/30036645/skz272.pdf",""

Thirty-Nine college softball pitchers (20.0±1.4 yrs.; 174.7±6.1 cm; 82.0±13.0 kg; 10.7±2.7 yrs. of experience) threw 3 pitches to a catcher while kinematic and kinetic data were collected. Pearson product moment correlations were run, and significant correlations found with glove arm kinematics, occurring before pelvis kinematics, trunk kinematics, and shoulder kinetics, were then put through a linear regression to identify whether there was any potential cause and effect. Results revealed that glove arm elbow flexion during phase 1 significantly predicted normalized shoulder rotation moment during phase 4 (t=2.60, p=0.013). Additionally, glove arm shoulder horizontal abduction during phase 1 significantly predicted normalized shoulder moment in phase 3 (t=− 2.40, p=0.021) and pelvic angular velocity during phase 3 (t=−  3.20, p=0.003). In conclusion, an active glove arm was predictive of a more efficient kinetic chain later in the windmill pitching motion and could possibly play a role in preventing injury by lessening pitching shoulder joint loads.","http://www.thieme-connect.de/products/ejournals/pdf/10.1055/a-0810-8637.pdf",""

This study also aimed to evaluate relationships between volatile compounds and consumer sensory responses. Beef strip loins (n = 72; 24/grade) of 3 quality grades (USDA Prime, Low Choice, and Low Select) were enhanced (8% of green weight with brine containing 0.35% salt and 0.4% sodium phosphate) or not enhanced, and cooked to 3 DOD (Rare: 60°C; Medium: 71°C; Very Well Done: 83°C) before volatile analysis. Volatile compounds were evaluated through a split-plot design where enhancement level and quality grade were used as the whole plot factors and DOD served as the subplot factor. Principal component analysis (PCA) was utilized to explore relationships between volatile compounds, consumer response, and treatments. The majority of compounds (n = 32) were impacted (P < 0.05) by the interaction between DOD × enhancement × quality grade. Four compounds- methanethiol, dimethyl-disulfide, methyl-benzene, and acetic acid were affected (P < 0.05) by enhancement × DOD. Two compounds- dimethyl sulfone and d-limonene, were impacted (P < 0.05) by quality grade × enhancement. Phenylacetaldehyde and hexanoic acid, methyl ester was affected (P < 0.05) by the interaction of USDA quality grade × DOD. The DOD main effect was only implicated in Maillard products (P < 0.05), including 2-methylbutanal, a Strecker aldehyde, and 2 pyrazines (methyl-pyrazine and trimethylpyrazine). Nonanal was the only compound impacted (P < 0.05) by a quality grade effect. No enhancement main effects were observed for any compounds (P > 0.05). In agreement, PCA indicated volatile compound production was primarily driven by degree of doneness and quality grade. There was no strong link between enhancement and beef volatile flavor compound development, despite the dramatically improved flavor liking scores from consumers.","https://www.iastatedigitalpress.com/mmb/article/9092/galley/9094/download/",""

The SEC has long required auditors to attest to BDs' internal controls and compliance with regulations (including those privately owned). Following the unraveling of the Madoff Ponzi scheme in 2008, the SEC required auditors of all BDs to register with the PCAOB, and Congressional initiatives signaled imminent transition from private (AICPA) to public (PCAOB) oversight. We investigate whether audit quality increased following this transition by measuring whether auditors report material internal control and compliance problems for BD clients where a deficiency presumably existed (i.e., BDs sanctioned by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority for transgressions against stakeholders). Overall, we do not find increased reporting quality following the regulatory shift but do observe variation by auditor group and BD ownership. While reporting quality for global network firms (GNFs) increases slightly, lower reporting quality observed prior to the regulatory shift for specialist audit firms (having large BD portfolios but small overall size) is exacerbated afterward. This finding complements results of PCAOB inspections and other research identifying audit quality problems among small, industry‐specialized firms in non‐public client settings. Focusing on deficiencies likely more difficult to detect, we find lower reporting quality for private relative to publicly affiliated BDs prior to PCAOB oversight, and lower reporting quality for very small audit firms relative to GNFs following the regulatory shift.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1911-3846.12473",""

This chapter discusses approaches to the teaching of academically underprepared postsecondary students and how teaching might be changed to improve student outcomes. A wide variety of approaches is reported in the literature, including teaching of discrete skills, providing strategy instruction, incorporating new and multiple literacies, employing disciplinary and contextualized approaches, using digital technology, and integrating reading and writing instruction. However, the field has yet to develop a clear theoretical framework or body of literature pointing to how teaching in this area might improve. Based on our reading of the literature, we recommend directions for future research that could inform changes in the teaching of underprepared students at the postsecondary level.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3102/0091732X18821114",""

Our analyses, which draw on U.S. Census microdata and content–coded newspaper reports (1910–1930), demonstrate considerable consistency in racial/ethnic labor market hierarchies, yet divergences in levels of labor market inequality. Specifically, our aggregate analyses and cross–city comparisons of sectoral representations and occupational returns reveal the importance of place–specific processes—processes consistent with what spatially sensitive queuing perspectives suggest about the bolstering of minority prospects in contexts where subordinated groups come to numerically dominate. As suggested by competition/threat perspectives, however, such gains from queuing are undermined at least to some extent by city–specific racial/ethnic antagonisms, industry–level segregation, and group closure.

However, the effectiveness in maintaining different cognitive domains varies greatly both across and within intervention types. To date, no systematic reviews have synthesized findings across more than a few types of interventions (e.g., cognitive vs. exercise). This systematic review examined nine types of behavioral interventions and the respective transfer to 18 cognitive domains and everyday function. The 2017 search yielded 75 unique eligible articles comprising of educational, theatre, mindfulness, cognitive, exercise, video game, and combination interventions. In general, there was limited evidence of consistent transfer from behavioral interventions to untrained cognitive domains. Few studies examined education, theatre, mindfulness, or video game interventions, leaving inconclusive results about their effect on cognitive function. Nine studies evaluated transfer to everyday function and found that both process- and strategy-based cognitive training conferred benefits up to 10 years posttest. These results suggest that while there is weak-to-moderate evidence of far transfer from behavioral interventions to untrained cognitive domains, it may be more important to examine far transfer to measures more indicative of older adult everyday life. Furthermore, it highlights the necessity to continue long-term follow-up. While there were notable limitations of the extant literature, including inconsistent use of terms such as active control or inadequate intervention description, there were strengths such as the recent implementation of factorial designs. Implications for future research and practice will be discussed.","http://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/3/Supplement_1/S652/32998793/igz038.2420.pdf",""

For example, even in the face of ongoing gene flow strong selection may maintain divergent polymorphisms, or gene flow may introduce novel biological diversity via hybridization and introgression from a divergent species. Herein, we elucidate the evolutionary history and genomic basis of a trophically polymorphic trait in a species of cichlid fish, Herichthys minckleyi. We explored genetic variation at 3 hierarchical levels; between H. minckleyi (n = 69) and a closely related species Herichthys cyanoguttatus (n = 10), between H. minckleyi individuals from 2 geographic locations, and finally between individuals with alternate morphotypes at both a genome-wide and locus-specific scale. We found limited support for the hypothesis that the H. minckleyi polymorphism is the result of ongoing hybridization between the 2 species. Within H. minckleyi we found evidence of geographic genetic structure, and using traditional population genetic analyses found that individuals of alternate morphotypes within a pool appear to be panmictic. However, when we used a locus-specific approach to examine the relationship between multi-locus genotype, tooth size, and geographic sampling, we found the first evidence for molecular genetic differences between the H. minckleyi morphotypes.","http://academic.oup.com/jhered/article-pdf/110/3/361/28532037/esz004.pdf",""

Lack of knowledge about ADRD and excessive worries about ADRD can cause cumulative stress and threaten physical and psychological well-being of older adults. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of a Brain Fitness Intervention (BFI) on the knowledge and worries about Alzheimer’s at three senior residential care facilities in China. Ninety older adults aged 60 and above underwent randomization. Fifty participants in the intervention group received eight weekly BFI sessions, including Tai Chi exercise, experiential learning, and group discussions. The primary outcomes were the changes from baseline to Week 8 in the scores on the ADRD knowledge scale (ranging 5–50) and worry scale (ranging 5–45). Twenty-seven participants withdrew from the study. Intent-to-treat analysis showed that the estimated mean change in knowledge on ADRD was 4.26 in the treatment group and -1.52 in the control group (p &lt; 0.001). The estimated mean change in worries about ADRD was -10.25 in the treatment group and -2.9 in the control group (p &lt; 0.001). Results remained robust in sensitivity analysis adjusting for study sites and baseline characteristics. Heterogeneity analysis showed that the treatment effect became stronger with the increase of age. Findings support the effectiveness of BFI in increasing ADRD knowledge and reducing worries among Chinese older adults.

GI presentations including abdominal pain, bleeding, malabsorption or protein losing enteropathy. Predisposing conditions are plasma cell dyscrasia, chronic inflammatory conditions or hemodialysis. We present case of Amyloidosis involving entire GIT presented with severe colon ischemia required total colectomy. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS:: A 59-year-old man with 6 months history of abdominal pain, bloating and constipation. He tried laxatives with partial relief. A colonoscopy revealed ulcerations in the sigmoid colon with biopsies consistent with ischemic colitis. CT angiography of the abdomen showed patent vessels with no findings to explain ischemic changes. A colonoscopy repeated 3 months later showed persistent inflammation in the sigmoid colon. He, subsequently, was diagnosed with multiple myeloma and initiated on bortezomib and dexamethasone. A few weeks after initiating this treatment, he presented to ED with significantly worsened abdominal pain, distension and nausea. CT A/P revealed thickening from the rectum to the descending colon with proximal dilation, concerning for pneumatosis and ischemic colitis. He was taken emergently for a total colectomy with end ileostomy. Pathology revealed that he, in fact, had extensive amyloidosis (transmural, interstitial, and vascular involvement) with hemorrhage and necrosis throughout the removed colon as well as the removed portion of the ileum with positive margins. There have been prior reports of colonic ischemia after initiation of bortezomib however this does not appear to be culprit in this case given the patient’s findings on initial colonoscopy prior to starting the medication. DISCUSSION:: Amyloid deposition infiltrates multiple organs. GIT involvement is common, rectal biopsy can confirm diagnosis. However, severe colon ischemia is uncommon presentation. Our patient presented with severe ischemic colitis and pneumatosis on CT scan. Prior to this, he had 2 colonoscopies, EGD, and abdominal fat biopsy all was non-diagnostic. He subsequently, had total colectomy, pathology revealed Amyloidosis. Duodenal biopsies confirmed small intestine amyloidosis. Colon ischemia due to Amyloidosis is rare. Diagnosis is challenging but can lead to detrimental consequences when it is delayed. Early diagnosis is critical in preventing progressive disease and potentially fatal complications.","https://journals.lww.com/10.14309/01.ajg.0000595996.94921.47",""

Drawing on a combination of documentary sources and interviews with long-time international crime policy insiders, it traces this interest back to the United Nations’ social defence agenda which emerged in the aftermath of the Second World War. We situate this agenda in relation to the Western aspiration to advance the Modernization project and reflect on how its shortcomings together with ideological, economic and geopolitical shifts at the international level contributed to the diversification of the United Nations’ crime policy agenda during the 1970s. These conditions collectively influenced the international community’s growing concern with crime as an existential threat to economic development during the 1980s. Our analysis highlights how this framing was reinforced by the rise of transnational organized crime as a threat to global capitalism following the collapse of the Soviet Union. It was against this historical backdrop that the United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention was established to lead the international community’s fight against ‘uncivil society’. We conclude by reflecting on United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention’s tumultuous early years along with the omission of ‘crime’ from the Millennium Development Goals and suggest that these conditions, along with the adoption of the United Nations Conventions Against Transnational Organized Crime and Corruption, set the stage for the organization’s future advocacy for the inclusion of crime in the Sustainable Development Goals.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1748895819877453",""

Public use of social media has cast players’ behavior of kneeling or sitting during the anthem into an international spotlight and led to individuals’ participation in political consumerism, including boycotting the NFL. The goal of this research is to examine the role of a hashtag in political consumerism through the lens of social impact theory and its relation to individuals’ consumption practices. Using social network and content analysis, this study examined a 4-day sample of tweets and accompanying hashtags that included #BoycottNFL during 9 days of the 2017 NFL season. Findings of this study suggest that the line between lifestyle and contentious political consumerism is blurred. Boycotting the NFL is contentious political consumerism, but it consists of lifestyle political consumerism through the individualized behavior of creating a tweet, which inadvertently is a part of collective action. Furthermore, the analysis indicated that accompanying hashtags demonstrated three types of political consumerism sentiment (i.e., political-, civic-, and consumption-related) that change the tone of a tweet, which may alienate actors who are focused on the consumption practices of the collective action.

The low flow recruitment hypothesis predicts that some fishes spawn in main channel habitats during low flows when water temperatures and prey densities are high. However, extreme low flows during drought periods might be disruptive even among fishes whose life histories otherwise benefit from lower flows. We studied recruitment dynamics of six fishes (family Cyprinidae) at 15 sites in a fragmented Great Plains riverscape in Kansas, USA, during 2 years of extreme drought. We tracked the chronology of gonadal development and age 0 recruitment to test the hypothesis that recruitment by fishes that broadcast spawn planktonic ova would be less successful compared with fishes that spawn demersal or adhesive ova. We found all six taxa were reproductively active but recruitment was evident for only four.

Calcareous nannoplankton, a dominant group of primary producers, were almost eradicated at this time. Post-impact nannoplankton assemblages from Northern Hemisphere sites were characterized by a short-lived series of high-dominance, low-diversity acmes (“boom-bust” successions), which likely represent an unstable post-impact environment. Although these boom-bust successions are a global signal, the mechanisms that controlled the taxonomic switchovers between acmes are currently unknown. Here, we present detailed analyses of calcareous nannoplankton and planktic foraminiferal assemblages in a new K-Pg section from the peak ring of the Chicxulub crater. We show that although nannoplankton assemblages resemble the typical series of acmes at Tethyan sites, the termination of the “disaster” acme in the crater is delayed by at least 500 k.y. The coincidence between shifts in the dominant planktic foraminiferal trophic group and switchovers in nannoplankton boom-bust taxa suggests that this series of acmes may represent a gradual trend toward oligotrophy driven by the global restoration of biological pump efficiency. Thus, the global diachroneity of boom-bust successions likely reflects the differential pacing of biological pump restoration between oceanic basins and settings.","https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-pdf/doi/10.1130/G46143.1/4719529/g46143.pdf",""

In a series of laboratory experiments that control for other aspects of volunteering, such as its signaling value, subjects demonstrate behavior consistent with the theoretical assumption that gifts of time produce greater utility than the same transfers in the form of money. Subjects perform an effort task, accruing earnings at potentially different wage rates for themselves or a charity of their choice, with the ability to transfer any of their personal earnings to charity at the end of the experiment.

We examined the effects of climate on breeding phenology and productivity in 19 populations across the range of the Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Dryobates borealis), an endangered species endemic to pine (Pinus spp.) forests in the southeastern United States. Red-cockaded Woodpeckers nested earlier in warmer springs and delayed nesting in wetter springs. Earlier nesting and larger group sizes resulted in higher productivity. Spring temperatures have warmed over time across the range, but this has not led to range-wide advances in nesting date over time. Coastal and northern populations have exhibited a trend of earlier nesting over time, but the response of inland populations has been variable, including some populations in which nesting has become later over time. Geographic patterns included high and increasing productivity at higher latitudes, and declining productivity in the southwestern portion of the range, suggesting a possible shift in acceptable climate conditions for the species. Earlier nesting over time was associated with increasing productivity at higher latitudes, while elsewhere earlier nesting over time was associated with declining or stable productivity, suggesting that populations differ in their ability to adjust to a changing climate. The Red-cockaded Woodpecker is a habitat specialist heavily reliant on habitat management and has little capacity to shift its range, so its long-term viability will depend on its ability to adjust in place to changing local conditions.","http://academic.oup.com/condor/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/condor/duz048/30144199/duz048.pdf",""

In this article, we draw on sociotechnical theories that conceive of social media as microsystems to understand the relationship between users, education, and social media companies. We identify and describe five topics concerning social media design that educators can consider and investigate with students in a variety of settings: user agreements and use of data; algorithms of oppression, echo, and extremism; distraction, user choice, and access for nonusers; harassment and cyberbullying; and gatekeeping for accurate information. In each case, we suggest curricular possibilities for teaching about social media platforms that draw from intersections of curriculum, media, and educational studies.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/016146811912101410",""

We propose a model for predicting and explaining employees’ reactions to organization-wide hardship. Our analysis and model make several contributions to the justice literature. First, we highlight the importance of organization-wide hardship (associated with pay freezes or pay cuts, increased working hours, or reduced work–family balance) as a potential contributor to the experience of low fairness for all employees in the organization. Second, we argue that research on the effects of management accounts (explanations) for their decisions should be extended by considering the effects of accounts from nonmanagement sources. Third, we highlight the potentially paradoxical effects of providing external (rather than internal) accounts to employees as these likely heighten the hardship’s perceived fairness yet also heighten employees’ concern for their organization’s future and hence their intended or actual turnover. Fourth, our article’s theorizing adds a temporal (future-oriented) perspective to the largely past-oriented perspective of organizational justice–related theorizing and research. We discuss the implications of our model for organizations and leaders and scholars who aim to study employees’ reactions to organization-wide hardship.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1059601119837045",""

The environment in Texas depends upon water discharged from the Edwards Aquifers, including ~1.5 million megaliters per year (ML/yr) from the Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) Aquifer and ~1 million ML/yr from the Edwards (Balcones Fault Zone) Aquifer. The first people in the area used the aquifer springs as drinking water and subsequently irrigated with the springs’ flow and then began drilling and pumping wells. Well production in the Edwards (Balcones Fault Zone) Aquifer was ~120,000 ML/yr in the 1930s and steadily increased over the next three decades to ~500,000 ML/yr, which is the average use from 1970 to 2015. Production from the Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) Aquifer was ~250,000 ML/yr from 1984 through 2016, while production from the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer was ~25,000 ML/yr from 1984 through 2016. The Interstate 35 growth corridor, extending from Bexar County (San Antonio) through New Braunfels, San Marcos, and Austin, Texas, and up to Bell County, is expected to grow from 4.6 million people in 2020 to 8.7 million in 2070. Despite the needs of this growing population, groundwater availability and regional water planning information suggests that pumping from the Edwards (Balcones Fault Zone) Aquifer over the next 50 yr will be limited.

Latent class analysis revealed three classes of Black racial identity: undifferentiated (average ideologies), integrationist (high assimilationist, humanist, and oppressed minority), and nationalist (high nationalist). The nationalist group was most likely to endorse rejecting Multiracial people as members of the Black community and also to endorse forcing a Black identity onto Multiracial people, whereas the integrationist group was least likely to make such endorsements. For participants in the nationalist (but not integrationist or undifferentiated) cluster, personal experiences of racism were related to endorsement of forcing a Black identity onto a Multiracial person.

To address this issue and to transmit critical messages between vehicles and drones deployed from service vehicles to overcome road incidents and obstacles, we proposed a hybrid technique based on fog computing called Hybrid‐Vehfog to disseminate messages in obstacle shadowing regions and a multihop technique to disseminate messages in nonobstacle shadowing regions. Our proposed algorithm dynamically adapts to changes in an environment and benefits in efficiency with robust drone deployment capability as needed. Performance of Hybrid‐Vehfog is carried out in Network Simulator and Simulation of Urban Mobility simulators.

This research contributes to efforts aimed at detecting forest degradation by analyzing the trend component of the time series of Leaf Area Index (LAI) collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) over Central Mexico from 2002 to 2017. The analysis of the trend component is proposed to overcome the challenge of identifying very subtle and gradual changes that can be undetected if only the raw time series is examined. Additionally, the use of LAI as an alternative to other widely used indexes (e.g., Normalize Difference Vegetation Index and Enhanced Vegetation Index) facilitates consideration of the structural changes evident from degradation though not necessarily observable with spectral indices. Overall, results indicate that 52% of the study area has experienced positive trends of vegetation change (i.e., increasing LAI), 37% has remained unchanged, and 11% exhibits some level of forest degradation. Particularly, the algorithm estimated that 0.6% (385 km2) is highly degraded, 5.3% (3406 km2) moderately degraded, and 5.1% (3245 km2) slightly degraded. Most of the moderate and highly degraded areas are distributed over the east side of the study area and evergreen broadleaf appears to be the most affected forest type. Model validation resulted an accuracy of 63%. Some actions to improve this accuracy are suggested, but also a different approach to validate this type of study is suggested as an area of opportunity for future research.","https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/11/21/2503/pdf",""

Objective: To assess microbial dysbiosis, fecal unconjugated bile acids (fUBA), and disease activity in dogs with steroid‐responsive CE. Animals: Twenty‐four healthy control dogs and 23 dogs with steroid‐responsive CE. Methods: In this retrospective study, fUBA were measured and analyzed. Fecal microbiota were assessed using a dysbiosis index. The canine inflammatory bowel disease activity index was used to evaluate remission of clinical signs. This was a multi‐institutional study where dogs with steroid‐responsive CE were evaluated over time. Results: The dysbiosis index was increased in dogs with CE (median, 2.5; range, −6.2 to 6.5) at baseline compared with healthy dogs (median, −4.5; range, −6.5 to −2.6; Conclusions and Clinical Importance: These findings suggest that corticosteroids regulate fecal bile acids in dogs with CE.

Once stories are deemed newsworthy, how do journalists calculate their relative utility? Such an ordering of preferences is important as higher ranked stories receive more media attention. To better understand how stories are ordered once they are selected, we propose a model for rational journalistic preferences which describes how journalists rank stories by making cost-benefit analyses. When faced with competing newsworthy stories, such as in an election context, the model can generate expectations regarding news coverage patterns. To illustrate model utility, we draw on a unique case – the US 2016 presidential election – to explain how reporters order newsworthy stories (e.g. scandal and the horse race) by observing changes in the volume. Our content data captures coverage featuring Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump on major broadcast and cable networks over 31  weeks. We find that the rational journalistic preference model explains the imbalance of scandal coverage between the two candidates and the dominance of horse race coverage. In 2016, such preferences may have inadvertently contributed to a balance of news stories that favored Trump.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1464884919845459",""

However, it remains unclear how MB affect the coronary blood flow in HCM patients. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of MB on coronary hemodynamics in HCM patients. Fifteen patients with MB (7 HCM and 8 non-HCM controls) in their left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery were chosen. Transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted in anatomically realistic models of diseased (with MB) and virtually healthy (without MB) LAD from these patients, reconstructed from biplane angiograms. Our CFD simulation results demonstrated that dynamic compression of MB led to diastolic flow disturbances and could significantly reduce the coronary flow in HCM patients as compared with non-HCM group ( P < 0.01). The pressure drop coefficient was remarkably higher ( P < 0.05) in HCM patients. The flow rate change is strongly correlated with both upstream Reynolds number and MB compression ratio, while the MB length has less impact on coronary flow. The hemodynamic results and clinical outcomes revealed that HCM patients with an MB compression ratio higher than 65% required a surgical intervention. In conclusion, the transient MB compression can significantly alter the diastolic flow pattern and wall shear stress distribution in HCM patients. HCM patients with severe MB may need a surgical intervention.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpheart.00466.2019",""

Basalt rock is commonly used as a building and construction material for foundations and dams, as well as in architectural designs such as constructing thin veneers and facades. Rotary ultrasonic machining, a hybrid process of grinding and ultrasonic machining, is employed to drill difficult-to-machine materials such as ceramics, composites, titanium alloys, stainless steel, etc. RUM has many advantages over conventional machining processes such as twist drilling. These advantages include lower cutting force, higher surface quality, lower tool wear, etc. This paper is the first in literature to report a study on edge chipping and surface roughness on RUM of basalt rock using cold compressed air as coolant. The effects of three input variables (tool rotation speed, feedrate, and ultrasonic power) on cutting force, torque, edge chipping, and surface roughness were studied. Experimental results obtained from this investigation show that RUM with cold air as the coolant has the capability to machine holes in basalt rock with a surface roughness of less than 3.5 μm without severe edge chipping.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/MSEC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/MSEC2019-2768/6456497/v002t03a039-msec2019-2768.pdf",""

This concept uses a pair of smaller electrodes to sequentially compress and join multiple locations across the tissue to form a joint. Due to the smaller area of the electrode surface, a higher compression level can be achieved with a smaller compressive force. In this study, different joining times including 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.9, 2.1 seconds with a 98% compression ratio were used to join porcine arterial tissue. In each test, three locations were sequentially compressed and joined. The resulting tensile strength, specific strength, energy consumption, and thermal dose from the sequential compression method were compared with those resulting from the nonsequential single compression method. For the 1.9-second joining time, the specific strength is 2.5 times higher than the highest specific strength achieved by the single joining method, meaning that only 40% of energy is needed to achieve an equivalent joint strength. A finite element model was built to estimate the temperature and thermal dose during the sequential joining process and also confirmed that the resulting thermal dose is much lower than the single joining method. The results validated that the sequential compression concept has the potential to minimize the thermal damage during the tissue joining process.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/MSEC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/MSEC2019-2946/6456487/v001t05a007-msec2019-2946.pdf",""

In this study, we examined the role these adipocyte progenitors play relating to intercellular communication in obesity-associated endometrial cancer. This is particularly relevant given that gap junctions have been implicated in tumor suppression. Examining the effects of ASCs on the transcriptome of endometrial epithelial cells (EEC) in an in vitro coculture system revealed transcriptional repression of GJA1 (encoding the gap junction protein Cx43) and other genes related to intercellular communication. This repression was recapitulated in an obesity mouse model of endometrial cancer. Furthermore, inhibition of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), which was the most abundant ASC adipokine, led to reversal of cellular distribution associated with the GJA1 repression profile, suggesting that PAI-1 may mediate actions of ASC on transcriptional regulation in EEC. In an endometrial cancer cohort (n = 141), DNA hypermethylation of GJA1 and related loci TJP2 and PRKCA was observed in primary endometrial endometrioid tumors and was associated with obesity. Pharmacologic reversal of DNA methylation enhanced gap-junction intercellular communication and cell–cell interactions in vitro. Restoring Cx43 expression in endometrial cancer cells reduced cellular migration; conversely, depletion of Cx43 increased cell migration in immortalized normal EEC. Our data suggest that persistent repression by ASC adipokines leads to promoter hypermethylation of GJA1 and related genes in the endometrium, triggering long-term silencing of these loci in endometrial tumors of obese patients. Significance:: Studies reveal that adipose-derived stem cells in endometrial cancer pathogenesis influence epigenetic repression of gap junction loci, which suggests targeting of gap junction activity as a preventive strategy for obesity-associated endometrial cancer.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/79/1/196/2778911/196.pdf",""

Residual feed intake was measured in growing Santa Gertrudis steers (Study 1; n = 57; initial BW = 291.1 ± 33.8 kg) and Brangus heifers (Study 2; n = 468; initial BW = 271.4 ± 26.1 kg) fed a high-roughage-based diet (ME = 2.1 Mcal/kg DM) for 70 d in a Calan-gate feeding barn. Animals were ranked by RFI based on performance and feed intake measured from day 0 to 70 (Study 1) or day 56 (Study 2) of the trial, and 20 animals with the lowest and highest RFI were identified for subsequent collections of fecal and feed refusal samples for DM and nutrient digestibility analysis. In Study 2, rumen fluid and feces were collected for in vitro methane-producing activity (MPA) and VFA analysis in trials 2, 3, and 4. Residual feed intake classification did not affect BW or BW gain (P &gt; 0.05), but low-RFI steers and heifers both consumed 19% less (P &lt; 0.01) DMI compared with high-RFI animals. Steers with low RFI tended (P &lt; 0.1) to have higher DM digestibility (DMD) compared with high-RFI steers (70.3 vs. 66.5 ± 1.6% DM). Heifers with low RFI had 4% higher DMD (76.3 vs. 73.3 ± 1.0% DM) and 4 to 5% higher (P &lt; 0.01) CP, NDF, and ADF digestibility compared with heifers with high RFI. Low-RFI heifers emitted 14% less (P &lt; 0.01) methane (% GE intake; GEI) calculated according to Blaxter and Clapperton (1965) as modified by Wilkerson et al. (1995), and tended (P = 0.09) to have a higher rumen acetate:propionate ratio than heifers with high RFI (GEI = 5.58 vs. 6.51 ± 0.08%; A:P ratio = 5.02 vs. 4.82 ± 0.14%). Stepwise regression analysis revealed that apparent nutrient digestibilities (DMD and NDF digestibility) for Study 1 and Study 2 accounted for an additional 8 and 6%, respectively, of the variation in intake unaccounted for by ADG and mid-test BW0.75. When DMD, NDF digestibility, and total ruminal VFA were added to the base model for Study 2, trials 2, 3, and 4, the R2 increased from 0.33 to 0.47, explaining an additional 15% of the variation in DMI unrelated to growth and body size. On the basis of the results of these studies, differences in observed phenotypic RFI in growing beef animals may be a result of inter-animal variation in apparent nutrient digestibility and ruminal VFA concentrations.","http://academic.oup.com/jas/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jas/skz195/28893213/skz195.pdf",""

The effector caspase genes (caspases-3, -6, and -7) were subsequently fixed into the Chordata phylum more than 650 MYA when the gene for a common ancestor (CA) duplicated, and the three effector caspases have persisted throughout mammalian evolution. All caspases prefer an aspartate residue at the P1 position of substrates, so each caspase evolved discrete cellular roles through changes in substrate recognition at the P4 position combined with allosteric regulation. We examined the evolution of substrate specificity in caspase-6, which prefers valine at the P4 residue, compared with caspases-3 and -7, which prefer aspartate, by reconstructing the CA of effector caspases (AncCP-Ef1) and the CA of caspase-6 (AncCP-6An). We show that AncCP-Ef1 is a promiscuous enzyme with little distinction between Asp, Val, or Leu at P4. The specificity of caspase-6 was defined early in its evolution, where AncCP-6An demonstrates a preference for Val over Asp at P4. Structures of AncCP-Ef1 and of AncCP-6An show a network of charged amino acids near the S4 pocket that, when combined with repositioning a flexible active site loop, resulted in a more hydrophobic binding pocket in AncCP-6An. The ancestral protein reconstructions show that the caspase-hemoglobinase fold has been conserved for over 650 million years and that only three substitutions in the scaffold are necessary to shift substrate selection toward Val over Asp.","https://portlandpress.com/biochemj/article-pdf/476/22/3475/860545/bcj-2019-0625.pdf",""

Yet, many injustices, which prompt calls for social justice, are created outside of the school by larger socioeconomic arrangements and require greater consideration and collaboration between schools and communities. Given the interrelatedness of schools and communities, this study explores the principal's role in addressing social injustices through activism and utilizing the community's resources and emerging political opportunities to promote social justice. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine how, if at all, do principals with social justice orientations engage in activism, particularly in relation to their school-community context and the networks and political opportunities that are available within and around the school. Setting: Data were collected in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico; Baltimore, United States; and Ceará, Brazil. Research Design: This qualitative multicase study used in-depth interviews and observations to explore the leadership actions of principals with social justice orientations. Findings: Findings revealed the specific actions taken by principals to understand the social and political context in which they work. The principals in the study utilized their understanding of context to inform their avenues for organizing activity and how they lead to strategically position their schools as resources to support communities and families. Challenges to an activist approach to leadership were also identified, including (a) tensions associated with the multifaceted nature of social justice and the demands; (b) ethical obligations of being a principal within a system and needing to adhere to district policies and priorities; and (c) the unpredictability and uncertainty of outcomes in certain school-community contexts. Conclusions/Recommendations: Major conclusions and recommendations for this study include the need to instill in principals a recognition that what happens in society impacts schools, and therefore, requires leadership to be attentive to community needs and activist-oriented. Preparing and supporting principals requires additional attention to how principals can lead for social justice with communities and in ways that are responsive to context. The potential constraints associated with being employed by a school district or connected to a social movement with predetermined priorities needs to be further explored and considered.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/016146811912100401",""

Although N3 substitution results in loss of activity, the N9‐substituted compounds retain nanomolar antiproliferative activities and the anti‐tubulin mode of action of the original unsubstituted compounds. Furthermore, our results also demonstrate that multidrug‐resistance (MDR) proteins do not confer resistance to both N9‐unsubstituted and ‐substituted compounds.

Two separate experiments were conducted (n = 120/experiment). In Experiment 1 and 2, panelists received the 5 treatment samples in a standard blind testing format in segment 1 (S1). In the second segment (S2) of Experiment 1, short descriptions were read aloud to participants before receiving each of their 5 samples, but all samples were actually USDA Select (false disclosure). In the second segment of Experiment 2, treatment descriptions were provided that matched the 5 treatments samples (true disclosure). When consumers evaluated samples in S1, they rated the Natural and CAB samples more tender and juicier (P < 0.05) than the other 3 treatments, and Organic was the least tender. Flavor and overall liking were greater (P < 0.05) for Natural and CAB steaks, while Conventional was intermediate, and flavor and overall liking were lowest for Grass and Organic (P < 0.05). When consumers received Select samples representing the 5 treatments, false disclosure decreased tenderness and juiciness of Natural, increased flavor liking of CAB, and increased tenderness, flavor liking, and overall liking of Organic (P < 0.05). True treatment disclosure increased flavor liking and overall liking of CAB and Grass, increased overall liking of Natural, and decreased juiciness of Conventional (P < 0.05).

Generation of free radicals and formation of adduct with critical proteins have been proposed as the possible mechanisms involved but the precise mechanism of acrolein mediated vascular alteration remains elusive. Peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) has been implicated in the pathology of diseases involving inflammation. The nuclear factor erythroid 2‐related factor 2 (Nrf2) is an important regulator of adaptive response to oxidative stress. Nrf2 activity is regulated partially through Keap1 protein. Keap1 binding to Nrf2 will keep the transcription factor in the cytoplasm. This study hypothesizes that exposure of rats to acrolein alters activation of Nrf2 through modification of Keap1 and/or modification of Nrf2. Design and method: Male Sprague‐Dawley rats (200–250 gm) were exposed to acrolein (1 mg/kg, gavage, 1 week) alone or in combination with rosiglitazone (Roz: PPARγ ligand; 10 mg/kg, gavages, 10 days). At the end of the treatment period, animals were sacrificed and isoprostane level was measured in urine as an indication of oxidative damage. ELISA and western blot analysis were used to measure changes in the expression/activity of Nrf2, Keap1 and HO‐1 in liver tissue. Results: Our results indicated increased generation of ROS in rats treated with acrolein. Addition of rosiglitazone ameliorated the effect of acrolein on ROS generation. Acrolein increased expression/activity of Nrf2 and HO‐1, while reduced expression of Keap1. Addition of rosiglitazone further increased expression/activity of Nrf2 and HO‐1 and reduced Keap1. Conclusions: Based on present data we are concluding that effect of acrolein on rat is partially due to the increased generation of ROS and subsequent alterations of Nrf2, Keap1 and HO‐1. These changes were further amplified with addition of rosiglitazone.","",""

However, the role of ASP in the emergency department (ED) setting is not well defined. Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of an ASP pharmacist culture review service in an ED. Methods: This was a retrospective, quasi-experimental study of all patients discharged from the ED with a positive culture. Patients discharged from the ED from February 1, 2015 to October 31, 2015 were managed by ED providers (pre-ASP), and those discharged from February 1, 2016 to October 31, 2016 were managed by a pharmacist-driven ASP (post-ASP implementation). The primary outcome was median time to change of antibiotic(s) in patients with inadequate antimicrobial therapy based on culture results. Secondary outcomes included time to culture evaluation, appropriateness of antimicrobials, and 30-day readmissions. Results: A total of 790 patients were included in the analysis (398 in pre-ASP group vs 392 in post-ASP implementation group). Median time to modification of inadequate antibiotic therapy decreased from 6.79 days in the pre-ASP group to 1.99 days in the post-ASP implementation group ( P < .0001). Median time to culture review decreased in the post-ASP implementation group from 9.83 to 0.32 days ( P < .0001). Appropriateness of culture-guided therapy increased in the post-ASP implementation group from 85.7 to 91.8% ( P = .047). The rate of combined ED revisits and hospital readmissions was similar between groups ( P = .367). Conclusion: ASP pharmacist evaluation of positive cultures in the ED was associated with a significant decrease in the time to appropriate therapy in patients discharged with inadequate therapy and higher rates of appropriate antimicrobial therapy.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0018578719844171",""

Unfortunately, diversion of freshwater for agriculture and development has decreased the size of GSL by 48%. To assess the potential impact of a smaller GSL on phalaropes, we collected data from 2013 to 2015 from sites where large, dense flocks of phalaropes congregated and sites where there were no phalaropes. At each site, we measured the densities of invertebrates that were preyed upon by phalaropes, including larval and adult brine flies (Ephydridae), adult brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana), chironomid larvae (Chironomidae), and corixid adults (Corixidae). Abiotic characteristics measured included water depth, water salinity, water temperature, wind speed, and benthic substrate. We analyzed high-salinity sites separately from low-salinity sites because they contained different invertebrates. High-salinity sites were in Carrington and Gilbert bays and were relatively deep (mostly &lt;2 m). At the high-salinity sites, phalaropes exhibited a preference for sites with an abundance of adult brine flies and for microbialite substrates. The low-salinity sites were in Ogden and Farmington bays and were shallow (&lt;1 m). At low-salinity sites, large phalarope flocks were more likely to occur at sites that were shallower, less saline, and had a high biomass of benthic macroinvertebrates. Our results indicate that physical features and prey availability are both important in determining phalarope habitat use at GSL. Phalaropes prefer to use shallower parts of GSL and brackish waters. These areas will be especially impacted by decreased freshwater inflow into GSL.","http://academic.oup.com/condor/article-pdf/121/2/duz005/31778179/duz005.pdf",""

Uninfected AMs were isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage of young (3 mo) and old (18 mo) C57BL/6 mice. AMs from old mice expressed higher mRNA levels of CCL2, IFN-β, IL-10, IL-12p40, TNF-α, and MIF than young mice, and old mice contained higher levels of CCL2, IL-1β, IFN-β, and MIF in their alveolar lining fluid.

We have evaluated a quantitative method to identify the pseudofaults by numerical simulation of depth migration on synthetic seismic records generated by finite-difference modeling of wave propagation. Detailed information on the spatial distribution and velocity range of the Permian igneous rocks is used to build a refined velocity model for the wave-equation-based forward modeling, calibrated with core, well log, and seismic data. It is found that the thickness and the migration velocity error used for the igneous rocks in depth migration are important factors affecting the pseudofault throws. There exists a strong quantitative relationship between igneous rock thickness ([Formula: see text]) and pseudofault throw ([Formula: see text]), [Formula: see text], where [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text] are constants for a given migration velocity error. For a maximum migration velocity error of 15% for the dacite bodies in the studied area, [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text] are 0.0002, 0.1864, and [Formula: see text], respectively. Using this relationship, the maximum fault throw ([Formula: see text]) of a pseudofault caused by an arbitrary thickness of any dacite body can be calculated. If the actual fault throw (H) of an apparent fault measured on the migrated seismic profile is greater than the calculated maximum fault throw for the fault, i.e., [Formula: see text], then the apparent fault is a real geologic fault. Otherwise, it is a pseudofault. The method has been successfully applied to produce corrected fault distribution maps for geologic evaluation of the Ordovician reservoirs in the Shuntuoguole region.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/INT-2018-0107.1",""

However, studies that examine the effects of clickers on learning often conceptualize a clicker exercise as a single, homogeneous cognitive processing (CP) event. We offer a conceptualization of sequenced cognitive activities that unfold during a clicker exercise. An inductive approach is adopted to identify three CP events that occur during a clicker exercise: an investigation event, a confirmation event, and a ratification event. We then use data collected from a sample of 187 students in an undergraduate business capstone course to explore the relationships between the three CP events and student learning. Contrary to expectations, not all CP events contribute positively to student learning. We discuss the implications of these findings and offer directions for future research that advance the understanding of clicker‐enhanced student learning. These insights afford instructors new options for optimizing the contributions of clicker exercises to student learning in their courses.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/dsji.12187",""

They then recalled an offense or hurt attributed to religious disagreements and indicated their motivations for forgiving the offender. Lower endorsement of individuating moral foundations predicted greater unforgiveness; however, cultural humility softened this relationship between individuating moral foundations and unforgiveness. When cultural humility was higher, participants were less likely to report unforgiveness motivations toward the religious offender, even if their individuating moral foundation scores were lower. Results from this study support the social buffering hypothesis of humility. Namely, individuals with higher levels of cultural humility demonstrate a greater capacity to maintain relationships during stressful religious disagreements by regulating intuitive and affective moral positions, particularly those that have previously been linked to social dominance or moral disinterest.

SILAR yielded the highest loadings of QDs per NW, whereas LAA enabled better control over the size and properties of QDs. Soft and hard x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy in conjunction with density functional theory calculations revealed that all α-V2O5/QD heterostructures exhibited Type-II band offset energetics, with a staggered gap where the conduction- and valence-band edges of α-V2O5 NWs lie at lower energies (relative to the vacuum level) than their QD counterparts. Transient absorption spectroscopy measurements revealed that the Type-II energetic offsets promoted the ultrafast (10−12–10−11 s) separation of photogenerated electrons and holes across the NW/QD interface to yield long-lived (10−6 s) charge-separated states. Charge-transfer dynamics and charge-recombination time scales varied subtly with the composition of heterostructures and the nature of the NW/QD interface, with both charge separation and recombination occurring more rapidly within SILAR-derived heterostructures. LAA-derived α-V2O5/CdSe heterostructures promoted the photocatalytic reduction of aqueous protons to H2 with a 20-fold or greater enhancement relative to isolated colloidal CdSe QDs or dispersed α-V2O5 NWs. The separation of photoexcited electrons and holes across the NW/QD interface could thus be exploited in redox photocatalysis. In light of their programmable compositions and properties and their Type-II energetics that drive ultrafast charge separation, the α-V2O5/QD heterostructures are a promising new class of photocatalyst architectures ripe for continued exploration.","http://aip.scitation.org/doi/am-pdf/10.1063/1.5128148",""

The goal of any producer is to find a feed source or combination of sources that provide a balance of nutrients that meet the requirements for maintenance, growth, and performance while efficiently contributing to favorable growth and carcass attributes at a low cost. Olive pomace is a by-product of the olive oil industry which can serve as a source of fat (14%), protein (3.6%), and fiber (44.5%). This by-product has potential as a supplemental source of energy and other essential nutrients to be blended into livestock rations. The objective of the study was to analyze the adipose tissue, and conduct a sensory trial from broilers fed different levels of olive pomace. Four pens, consisting of 10 broilers each at 34 days of age, were provided four feed diets in separate feeders. Feeders were filled with either a commercial broiler feed (control), or an olive pomace to commercial broiler feed mixture at 1:3, 1:1, or 3:1. The broilers were fed for 27 days, harvested, a fat sample was taken for fatty acid analysis, and a breast was taken from each bird for sensory analysis. The sensory trial on the chicken breast was to determine if students (n = 42) could detect flavor differences between treatment groups. No significant differences were detected between treatment groups in the sensory analysis (P &gt; 0.79). Fat samples showed that all of the fat from the control, 1:3, and 3:1 were similar, however, the 1:1 treatment had lower amounts of docosahexaenoic acid and higher amounts of decanoic acid. While unsure about the differences in fatty acid content for 1:1 treatment, the results illustrate that olive pomace can be fed in large amounts and not affect the palatability of the resulting product.","http://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/97/Supplement_3/358/31256506/skz258.714.pdf",""

Facility types included three-leg stop-controlled (3ST) and four-leg stop-controlled (4ST) intersections under state or county jurisdiction and were sampled from each of Michigan’s 83 counties. To isolate lower-volume rural intersections, major roadway traffic volumes were limited to the range of 400–2,000 vehicles per day (vpd). Data were compiled from several sources for 2,023 intersections statewide. These data included traffic crashes, volumes, roadway classification, geometry, cross-sectional features, and other site characteristics covering the period of 2011–2015. Random effects negative binomial regression models were specified for each stop-controlled intersection type considering factors such as driveway density, lighting presence, turn lane presence, and intersection skew, in addition to volume. To account for the unobserved heterogeneity between counties, mixed effects negative binomial models with a county-specific random effect were utilized. Furthermore, unobserved temporal effects were controlled through the use of a year-specific random effect. Separate models were developed for fatal/injury crashes, property damage crashes, and select target crash types. The analysis found that skew angles of greater than five degrees led to significantly greater crash occurrence for both 3ST and 4ST intersections, while greater than two driveways near the intersection led to significantly greater angle crashes at 4ST intersections. Other factors were found to have little impact on crash occurrence. Comparison with the Highway Safety Manual (HSM) base models showed that the HSM models over-predict crashes on 4ST intersections and 3ST intersections with volumes between 1,200 and 2,000 vpd.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0361198119840348",""

Advocacy of technological solutions to CO2 mitigation is consistent with ecological modernization theory's assertion that reflexive societies will modernize sustainably. In contrast, we define the “treadmill of information” as the unique contribution of ICT development to environmental degradation. We examine the impact of ICT development on total CO2 emissions and source-sector emissions from electricity, buildings, manufacturing, and transportation using a multilevel growth model for panel data from 113 countries split into the world, developed country, and less-developed-country samples. We find that the level of fixed telephone development is a strong predictor of higher CO2 emissions in less-developed countries, while internet use predicts higher CO2 emissions in developed countries. The effect of mobile telephone development is not significant. Thus, it appears that ICTs are not having an ameliorative effect on global warming as expected by ecological modernization theorists, and instead reinforce the treadmill of production's negative effect.","http://online.ucpress.edu/socdev/article-pdf/5/4/381/395397/sod_2019_5_4_381.pdf",""

These data are sorted based on length of the record and missing values and arranged for the period 1973–2003.

Subprimals were fabricated into 2.5-cm steaks at 21 d postmortem and stored frozen until further analysis. Consumer (n = 120) sensory panelists evaluated cooked steaks for tenderness, juiciness, flavor liking, and overall liking. Trained panelists (n = 15 sessions) evaluated each sample for initial and sustained juiciness, initial and sustained tenderness, flavor intensity, and off-flavor intensity. For all traits, consumer and trained panelists’ scores generally decreased with decreasing marbling score, regardless of maturity. According to consumers, maturity had no effect on juiciness or flavor liking within each marbling score, except flavor liking of SLAB+ was greater (P < 0.05) for young than mature carcasses. Conversely, young carcasses had greater tenderness scores than mature within all marbling categories except SM, which translated to greater overall liking of MD/MT, SL, and TR/PD of young compared to their mature counterparts (P < 0.05). Trained panelists detected very few differences between young and mature samples within their respective marbling score; however, M-MD/MT had lower initial and sustained tenderness coupled with greater off-flavor intensity than Y-MD/MT (P < 0.05). Mature samples with SLAB+ and MD/MT marbling were rated greater than or equal to Y-SM for all traits, indicating the presence of marbling from feeding a grain diet prior to harvest may elicit a similar eating experience to young beef by offsetting negative palatability traits often associated with mature beef.","https://www.iastatedigitalpress.com/mmb/article/9095/galley/9101/download/",""

However, counselor education programs generally lag, and there is a dearth of literature regarding the process of identifying and integrating career theory and counseling theory. This phenomenological study examined 6 students’ perceptions of the process of career theory identification and integration.

The results indicate that a joint consideration of a firm’s core business strategy and organizational commitment to IT provides insights into whether the firm should emphasize new IT or current IT when allocating IT investments. With an increase in organizational commitment to IT, firms pursuing stable products/markets (i.e., Defender(s)) benefit more from current IT, whereas firms seeking new products/markets (i.e., Prospector(s)) benefit more from new IT. Finally, for firms seeking some stable products/markets and some new ones (i.e., Analyzer(s)), organizational commitment to IT does not influence the benefits from emphasizing new or current IT.

We argue and find that firms with more humble CEOs will have better market performance but not because they actually perform better but, rather, because they benefit from an expectation discount in the market. Specifically, we show that, all else equal, financial analysts announce lower earnings per share expectations for firms with more humble CEOs. This expectation discount sets the stage for those firms to meet or beat analysts' expectations resulting in improved market performance for firms with humble CEOs. We find support for our ideas with a sample of Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 CEOs, operationalizing CEO humility with a videometric technique. In this study, we investigate the effect of CEO humility on firm's market performance. We show that firms with more humble CEOs will outperform other firms in the market because financial analysts tend to set lower market expectations for firms with more humble CEOs increasing the probability that they will outperform those expectations.

However, computational modeling demonstrates that the quinoline derivatives interact with the ligand‐binding domain, whereas the bis‐indoles preferentially interact with a C‐terminal cofactor binding site of NR4A2. In this study, the effects of DIM‐C‐pPhCl and related analogs were compared with CQ/AQ as inducers of NR4A2‐responsive genes including vasoactive intestinal peptide, osteopontin, proopiomelanocortin, and neuropilin 1 in Panc1 and Panc28 pancreatic cancer cells. The results demonstrate that, among the bis‐indole analogs, their relative potencies as inducers were structure‐gene‐ and cell context dependent. In contrast, CQ and AQ were significantly less potent than the bis‐indole derivatives and, for some of the NR4A2‐regulated genes, CQ and AQ were inactive as inducers. These results demonstrate that although bis‐indole and quinoline derivatives have been characterized as activators of NR4A2‐dependent gene expression, these two classes of compounds exhibit different activities, indicating that they are selective NR4A2 modulators.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/cbdd.13564",""

It examines the cases of three graduates of an urban education–focused teacher preparation program who claim different intersectional identities and have completed their fourth year as urban educators. The article explores two research questions. First, how do these teachers understand and enact critical education practices within their curriculum and instruction, socially situated relationships, and institutional structures? Second, how do they experience and understand their sociocultural identities as contributors to their practices as critical educators and the associated outcomes? Two findings are discussed. First, the teachers felt greatest agency and success within their classrooms (in comparison to other institutional spaces) to enact social justice–oriented curricula, instruction, and other educational practices, using relationship-building with students as the foundation of their work. Second, identity constructs of gender, age, and race significantly mediated the teachers’ relationship-building efforts with colleagues and administrators, the teachers’ feelings of agency, and their activities and outcomes related to justice-oriented change at institutional levels beyond the classroom. This study contributes a rare longitudinal example of how in-service critical educators’ sociocultural identities impact their literacy pedagogies and institutional efforts to advance educational justice.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2381336919870267",""

We hypothesized that higher levels of parental stress and lower coparenting quality would be associated with increased dating violence perpetration and victimization. Prior to running a path analysis to test our hypotheses, we examined how frequently the Latinx adolescent mothers in our sample reported perpetrating at least one act of psychological or physical abuse against their partner in the past month. We found that 84.3% of the mothers in our study had perpetrated at least one act of violence against their partner in the past month and 74.7% reported they had been the victim of at least one act of violence by their partner in the past month. After accounting for frequency of contact with the father of their child, we found Latinx adolescent mothers were more likely to perpetrate abuse against, as well as be the victim of abuse by, their partner if they had a lower quality coparenting relationship. However, parental stress was not associated with dating violence perpetration or victimization after accounting for frequency of contact. Our findings show the importance of the quality of the coparenting relationship, above and beyond parental stress, as a predictor of dating violence victimization and perpetration, thus highlighting the importance of educating adolescent parents about how to navigate the coparenting relationship.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0886260519862269",""

The study proposes likelihood inference methods for item paramter estimation and evaluates their performance along with optimal sampling procedures. An extensive simulation study indicates that the proposed online calibration strategies perform well with relatively small samples (e.g., 500∼800 examinees). The analysis of estimated parameters suggests that response time information can be used to improve the recovery of the response model parameters. Among a number of sampling methods investigated, A-optimal sampling was found most advantageous when the item parameters were weakly correlated. When the parameters were strongly correlated, D-optimal sampling tended to achieve the most accurate parameter recovery.

Voter referenda that target lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender groups may be 1 contextual factor contributing to homophobic bullying. METHODS:: Data come from 14 consecutive waves (2001–2014) of cross-sectional surveys of students participating in the California Healthy Kids Survey (N = 4 977 557). Student responses were aggregated to the school level (n = 5121). Using a quasi-experimental design, we compared rates of homophobic bullying before and after Proposition 8, a voter referendum that restricted marriage to heterosexuals in November 2008. RESULTS:: Interrupted time series analyses confirmed that the academic year 2008–2009, during which Proposition 8 was passed, served as a turning point in homophobic bullying. The rate of homophobic bullying increased (blinear = 1.15; P &lt; .001) and accelerated (bquadratic = 0.08; P &lt; .001) in the period before Proposition 8. After Proposition 8, homophobic bullying gradually decreased (blinear = −0.28; P &lt; .05). Specificity analyses showed that these trends were not observed among students who reported that they were bullied because of their race and/or ethnicity, religion, or gender but not because of their sexual orientation. Furthermore, the presence of a protective factor specific to school contexts among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth (gay-straight alliances) was associated with a smaller increase in homophobic bullying pre–Proposition 8. CONCLUSIONS:: This research provides some of the first empirical evidence that public campaigns that promote stigma may confer risk for bias-based bullying among youth.","https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-pdf/doi/10.1542/peds.2018-2116/1099970/peds_20182116.pdf",""

Researchers have argued for the need to turn attention back to developing better theoretical models with clear conceptualizations and operationalizations of the power construct. Wagers articulated such a theory and introduced a “super construct” called internal power. This article seeks to further develop and empirically test Wagers’s theory. Confirmatory factor analysis is used to examine the viability of the internal power construct, and structural equation modeling is used to test the relationship between the internal power factor and self-reported interpersonal abusive behaviors. Findings indicate internal power is a viable construct that warrants further exploration and offer preliminary support for internal power theory as an explanation of intimate partner violence.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0886260519834092",""

The first is that insect consumption ignores the precautionary principle, which we can gloss here as “Don’t know, don’t farm.” In other words, although there might be evidence that insects are not conscious, we do not know that they are not; so, we should not take the moral risk associated with killing them en masse. The second concern is driven by a different way of assessing moral risk—namely, by calculating expected utility. The short version: even if it is incredibly unlikely that insects are conscious, farming them involves harming so many of them that it is better simply to grow plants instead. The third concern is about whether insects live “net negative lives,” with more pain than pleasure. The thought is that if they do, then their lives are not worth living overall, in which case it is wrong to bring them into existence. I conclude by considering the prospects for strategic alliances between animal advocates and those who promote insect consumption, in the even that they are unable to resolve their moral disagreements.","http://academic.oup.com/aesa/article-pdf/112/6/511/30649448/saz011.pdf",""

This study focuses on geostatistical modeling the Paleocene Zelten Carbonate reservoir in the Meghil field. The field was discovered in 1959 and production operations began in 1961. Nineteen wells have been drilled to date. The structural framework consists of three slightly asymmetrical anticlinal structures trending NW-SE with steeper dip on the SW flanks. Each of the structures are separated by major normal faults. Seismic interpretation suggests that carbonate build-ups are most likely present on the three separate structures. Edge detection was used to clarify the structural geometries and the presence of additional minor faults. Pillar gridding technique was used to develop the structural framework including four major faults that are partially sealed based on analysis of the available DST and production test data. Stratigraphic analysis indicates a local presentation of dolomitic limestone in the northern portion of the main and the western structures caused considerable litho-facies variation that impacted the distribution of the petrophysical properties. Basic and advanced formation evaluation the net reservoir thickness of about 15 feet with an average porosity of 17% and average water saturation of 35%. Geostatistical-based applications that combine the spatial statistics (e.g. the semivariogram) and the available well and core data were used to populate the reservoir model with porosity, permeability, facies (lithology), net/gross, and water saturation. A conceptual facies model was also used to constrain the reservoir property distributions. Sequential Gaussian Simulation (SGS) was used to populate the model with porosity and water saturation and Sequential Indicator Simulation (SIS) was used to populate the facies model with permeability. The modeling parameters (e.g. semivariogram, correlation coefficients) were significantly constrained by the limited number of wells. Based on the limited number of wells available the semivariogram analysis resulted in a spherical semivariogram model with major axis range of 1435 meters for porosity and 1800 meters for water saturation. Minor axis ranges were about 50% of the major axis ranges. Given the limited well data, a significant effort was made to document the potential impact of the semivariogram parameters on the original hydrocarbon in place (OHIP) estimates and the lateral stratigraphic continuity of reservoir properties. The deterministic approach resulted in place volume estimates of 60 MMBBL and the stochastic approach provided an estimate of 45 MMBBL.","http://onepetro.org/SPEATCE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/195988-MS/1151362/spe-195988-ms.pdf",""

Illite crystallinity d(001) of air-dried, fine (&lt;0.2 μm) authigenic clays (Δ°2θ (CuKα) = 0.417° to 0.875°) yield a range of conditions from diagenetic temperature to lower anchizone temperatures up to ∼200 °C. Air-dried, fine authigenic chlorite clays (Δ°2θ (CuKα) = 0.259° to 1.570°) yield a wide range of diagenetic to metamorphic conditions that span the diagenetic zone through epizone, which indicate a maximum temperature slightly above ∼300 °C. These results are in contrast to prior thermal maturation data. No additional heat sources, such as from pluton emplacement, were identified by major areas of anomalous high maturation based on crystallinity.

Although the mechanisms of DAP resistance in enterococci are not fully comprehended, they are associated with alterations in cell envelope phospholipids assembly which leads to either repulsion of the drug from cell exterior or diversion from the cell septum. In this context, we sought to evaluate combinations of DAP with a panel of β-lactams including ampicillin (AMP), amoxicillin (AMX), ceftaroline (CPT), ceftriaxone (CRO) and ertapenem (ERT). Methods: E. faecium R497 harboring liaSFR mutations (DAP MIC of 16 mg/L) was evaluated in a simulated endocardial vegetation (SEV) pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic model over 336 h at a starting inoculum of 109 log10 CFU/g. DAP 10 mg/kg/day combinations with AMP, AMX (2 g continuous infusion), CPT 600 mg q 12 h, CRO 2g q 24 h or ERT 1 g q 24 h were evaluated. The emergence of DAP resistance was determined daily over the course of treatment. Results: DAP alone was not bactericidal and high-level DAP resistance was observed (MIC increase from 16 to 64 µg/mL). Combination of DAP+AMP offered a significant reduction in log10CFU/g amounts (Up to 7 log10 CFU/g and to detection limits) in 24h in with no emergence of DAP resistance. DAP 10+ AMX caused 6–6.5 log10 CFU/g reduction and counts were maintained around the detection limit while demonstrating no increased resistance. Dose de-escalation with AMP indicated that even DAP 4 mg/kg/d with AMP (2g) combination, reached detection limit at 168 h with no further resistance. None of the CPT, CRO or ERT regimens in combination with DAP was effective against R497 and elevated DAP MICs (>64 µg/mL) was observed during the 14-day model. Conclusion: Combination of DAP+AMP offered the most encouraging results against E. faecium R497, while DAP+AMX caused enhanced reduction. The reason for this discrepancy in various β-lactam activity may be related to diverse β-lactam targeting or affinity toward PBP proteins. Further dissection of our observations is warranted to understand the optimized DAP-β-lactam combination and consequently improve patient outcomes and prevention of resistance.

NOTCH signaling is highly activated in glioma and activated NOTCH signaling is associated with increased tumor growth and therapeutic resistance. Effect of oncolytic virus therapy on NOTCH signaling activation has not been reported to our knowledge. METHODS: Western blotting, real time Q-PCR, reporter assay, and bioluminescence mice imaging were used to evaluate oHSV-mediated activation of NOTCH signaling. High throughput analysis of HSV-1-encoded microRNAs and genes were performed to identify the activator of NOTCH signaling, and in silico analysis, 3’ untranslated region (3’UTR) assay, and immunoprecipitation were used to uncover the down-stream signaling. Anti-tumor efficacy of NOTCH inhibitor, gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) combined with oHSV was evaluated using intracranial glioma-bearing mouse xenografts. RESULTS: oHSV infection induced NOTCH activity in glioma PDX cells. High throughput analysis uncovered this to be due to HSV-1-encoded miR-H16 (miR-H16). 3’UTR analysis of Factor Inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH-1) indicated miR-H16 directly target FIH-1 and repress its protein expression. Immunoprecipitation analysis also uncovered that FIH-1 reduction liberated Mild bomb 1 (Mib1) from FIH-1 mediated sequestration, permitting it to activate NOTCH signaling by ubiquitination of NOTCH ligands. Forced expression of either antago-miR-H16 or FIH-1 attenuated the oHSV-induced NOTCH activation. Furthermore, oHSV therapy-induced activation of NOTCH signaling sensitized tumors to GSI, resulting in significantly improved therapeutic response to oHSV therapy and prolonged the survival in several intracranial GBM xenografts. CONCLUSION: In this study, we identified the mechanism of oHSV therapy-mediated activation of NOTCH signaling, and showed the therapeutic benefit of combining oHSV with GSI.","http://academic.oup.com/neuro-oncology/article-pdf/21/Supplement_6/vi49/30633051/noz175.193.pdf",""

To achieve the objective DNS is performed for plane channel flow at Reτ = 640, Pr = 0.71 and 0.025 involving mixed forced and natural convection condition, and RANS, hybrid RANS/LES, and LES calculations are performed for backward backing step with expansion ratio 1.5, Pr = 0.71 and 0.0088 and Ri = 0 and 0.338. Channel flow simulations reveal that the convective conditions affect the near-wall turbulent structures and thermal diffusion more significantly in high-Re flows that in low-Re flows. Thus, the generated DNS database provides a challenging test case for turbulence model validation. For backward facing step case, all the turbulence models predict the overall flow characteristics, and Ri = 0 case is a more challenging validation test case than Ri = 0.338, as the former involves complex turbulent diffusion, whereas the latter is dominated by large scale buoyancy driven convection. Results show that well resolved PANS and LES predictions can help in improve understanding of turbulent diffusion under complex convection and flow separation/ reattachment regimes. RANS results are also quite encouraging and indicates that they may represent a reasonable compromise between computational expense and accuracy for cases in which high resolution simulations are not feasible.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/FEDSM/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/AJKFluids2019-5273/6449404/v002t02a054-ajkfluids2019-5273.pdf",""

We hypothesized that PCV13 immunized children would similarly harbor vaccine serotypes in their nasopharynx (NP) that could only be identified by molecular technology. Methods: We compared use of enhanced microbiologic culture vs. molecular technology to characterize SP colonization among NP swabs collected from 995 healthy or sick children <5 years old at Boston Medical Center from November 2015 to May 2017. NP specimens were broth enriched for 4 hours and cultured on selective blood agar. Specimens were evaluated for presence of SP using both routine microbiologic methods and RT–PCR. RT–PCR assays targeted the lytA, and piaB (SP membrane permease) genes, and 26 SP serotypes: all serotypes included in 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and 13 prevalent non-vaccine serotypes Results: A total of 162 (16.3%) NP specimens were positive for SP via enhanced culture, and an additional 163 (16.3%) were SP positive via lytA+ RT–PCR molecular technology. Prevalence of SP carriage was equivalent in children aged 0<2 years and 2≤5 years, but greater in children with respiratory tract infections (RTI) compared with children without RTI (26.5% vs. 9.6% among culture+ specimens only; and 43.2% vs. 25.8% among combined culture+ and molecular+ specimens). Using enhanced culture only, vaccine serotypes (VST) were identified in 4 (1%) of 450 children <2 years and 14 (2.6%) of 545 children 2 ≤5 years; adding molecular positive specimens increased the prevalence of VST to 2.9% in children <2 years and 4.6% in children 2 ≤5 years (table). Serotypes 3 and 19A were the two most commonly identified VST. Conclusion: Combining molecular technology with enhanced culture reveals an increased prevalence of vaccine serotype colonization in young children. The ability of sensitive molecular methods to detect vaccine serotypes in culture-negative specimens suggests low-density vaccine serotype carriage persists in a highly immunized pediatric population. The importance of culture negative but RTPCR positive carriage for transmission requires further evaluation.

Our objective is to test the hypothesis that An can classify the flow in patient-specific intracranial aneurysms (IA). Therefore, the definition of this parameter is extended to anatomic geometries by using hydraulic diameter and the length of expansion area in the approximate direction of the flow. The hypothesis is tested using image-based flow simulations in five sidewall and four bifurcation geometries, i.e., if An ≲ 1 (shorter transport time scale), then the fluid is transported across the neck before the vortex could be formed, creating a quasi-stationary shear layer (cavity mode). By contrast, if An ≳ 1 (shorter vortex time scale), a vortex is formed. The results show that if An switches from An ≲ 1 to An ≳ 1, then the flow mode switches from the cavity mode to the vortex mode. However, if An does not switch, then the IAs stay in the same mode. It is also shown that IAs in the cavity mode have significantly lower An, temporal fluctuations of wall shear stress and oscillatory shear index (OSI) compared to the vortex mode (p &lt; 0.01). In addition, OSI correlates with An in each flow mode and with pulsatility index in each IA. This suggests An to be a viable hemodynamic parameter which can be easily calculated without the need for detailed flow measurements/ simulations.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.5081451/19759465/031905_1_online.pdf",""

A principal component analysis (PCA) with a VARIMAX rotation was used to divide Oklahoma into four spatially contiguous regions with similar drought patterns that are located in northwestern, northeastern, southwestern and southeastern regions of the state. Droughts tend to occur more frequently in northwestern Oklahoma, but all four regions show that droughts in Oklahoma have substantial variability at decadal timescales. A Mann–Kendall trend test demonstrates that there has been a statistically significant increase in the SPEI in Oklahoma since 1901. This indicates that conditions are generally getting wetter in Oklahoma. However, there is substantial variability in moisture conditions that is evident at shorter timescales. Prolonged periods of drier than normal conditions occurred in the 1910s, 1930s, 1950s, 1970s and 1980s, while conditions from the 1980s to the 2000s have been wetter than normal. Recently, the SPEI has decreased, which suggests that Oklahoma may be at the beginning of another dry cycle. In addition, while most droughts during the study period were caused by decreases in precipitation, recent droughts, such as the severe drought in 2011, were caused by both decreases in precipitation and increases in potential evapotranspiration.

Novel halometabolites isolated from nature inspire scientists to synthesize these “chance compounds”, which were, however, usually hampered by the extreme catalytic conditions and severe selectivity challenges. In the past several decades, enzymatic reactions have been brought into attention for their efficiency, selectivity, and mild reaction conditions. Synthetic biology which is in compliance with the laws of nature to a large extent shed light on the rational biosynthesis of halogenated compounds. This article summarizes several representative categories of halogenated natural products and halogenases to seek clues to the relationship between the structures and halogenase mechanisms. Some types of halogenase convert the basic building blocks to diverse early intermediates during natural product biosynthetic processes, while others are involved in the late tailoring steps to afford the final structures of halogenated molecules. The broad substrate specificity and strong regioselectivity exhibited in some halogenases are irreplaceable advantages for biosynthesis. In addition, tremendous efforts and encouraging results enable us to engineer the enzymes or techniques to synthesize “unnatural” halogenated natural products. More reaction mechanisms and structural data are expected to be revealed exponentially in this rapid growing realm.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fijch.201800175",""

Relative compensation may thereby constitute an alternative control mechanism when performance-based compensation is difficult to implement. Using proprietary data from 436 hotels in a U.S. lodging chain, we find that relative compensation is positively associated with performance, and additional profits associated with higher compensation exceed the wage increase. Relative compensation has a larger impact on profit when tasks are more complex and a smaller impact on profit, revenue, and quality when chain monitoring is stronger. Finally, the magnitude of the relation between relative compensation and financial performance (nonfinancial) is larger (the same) for employees earning more than the median wage compared with those earning less. Overall, our results are consistent with assertions that higher relative compensation attracts more capable candidates and mitigates shirking, but provide little support for reciprocity.","https://publications.aaahq.org/jmar/article-pdf/32/3/137/4901/i1558-8033-32-3-137.pdf",""

However, it has been difficult to correlate clinical signs and symptoms. Currently, there are no laboratory tests to diagnose concussion, though several biomarkers are being investigated.

Most studies lump Black immigrants (BIs) and African Americans (AAs) as “Black/African American” during investigation. Such categorization assumes that the sociocultural determinants that influence BIs are the same as for AAs. This study attempts to disentangle the AA and BI subgroups to recognize the differences in cancer-related psychosocial characteristics and health behaviors. Methods. Merged data from the Health Information National Survey (2011–2017) were used. Two groups were created: those who identified as AA and those who identified as AA but were born outside the United States (BI). Between-group differences were assessed with Mann–Whitney U and chi-square tests. Results. Positive communication patterns with health care providers were significantly higher among AAs ( M [mean] = 3.41, SD [standard deviation] = 0.68) compared with BIs ( M = 3.28, SD = 0.71) ( p = .004). A greater proportion of BIs indicated that their health was excellent (14.2%), compared with AAs (7.9%). AAs reported higher cancer family history (75.1%) than BIs (46.5%). More AAs had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime (41.5%) than BIs (16.7%). BIs consumed significantly more fruits each day ( M = 2.77, SD = 1.43) than AAs ( M = 2.40, SD = 1.44) ( p < .001). BIs also reported more physical activity ( M = 2.62, SD = 2.15) than AAs ( M = 2.37, SD = 2.18) ( p = .030). AA women were more likely to have had a pap smear test ( M = 2.07, SD = 1.44) compared with BI women ( M = 1.73, SD = 1.21) ( p = .002). Discussion. Evidence suggests the need to disentangle the “Black/African American” ethnic grouping. Lumping the BI populations together with the AAs, who have been in the United States for generations, may limit the ability to uncover and consequently address culturally driven disease prevention efforts and promote understanding of the biological, environmental, and psychosocial risk factors within Black heterogeneous populations.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1090198119859399",""

As HPA function differs between sexes and depends on circulating estradiol (E2) levels in females, we investigated sex/estrous stage-dependent glucocorticoid regulation of PVN Crh. Using NanoString nCounter technology, we first demonstrated that adrenalectomized (ADX’d) diestrous female (low E2), but not male or proestrous female (high E2), mice exhibited a robust decrease in PVN CRH mRNA following 2-day treatment with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonist RU28362. Immunohistochemical analysis of PVN CRH neurons in Crh-IRES-Cre;Ai14 mice, where TdTomato fluorescence permanently tags CRH-expressing neurons, showed similarly abundant co-expression of GR-immunoreactivity in males, diestrous females, and proestrous females. However, we identified sex/estrous stage-related glucocorticoid regulation or expression of GR transcriptional coregulators. Out of 17 coregulator genes examined using nCounter multiplex analysis, mRNAs that were decreased by RU28362 in ADX’d mice in a sex/estrous stage-dependent fashion included: GR (males = diestrous females &gt; proestrous females), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) (males &lt; diestrous = proestrous), and HDAC1 (males &lt; diestrous &gt; proestrous). Steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3), nuclear corepressor 1 (NCoR1), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (hnrnpu), CREB binding protein (CBP) and CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2) mRNAs were lower in ADX’d diestrous and proestrous females versus males. Additionally, most PVN CRH neurons co-expressed methylated CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2)-immunoreactivity in diestrous female and male Crh-IRES-Cre;Ai14 mice. Our findings collectively suggest that GR’s sex-dependent regulation of PVN Crh may depend upon differences in the GR transcriptional machinery and an underlying influence of E2 levels in females.","http://academic.oup.com/endo/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1210/endocr/bqz012/31081173/bqz012.pdf",""

Determining whether secondary contact leads to gene flow between species is important for understanding both the evolutionary consequences of such events (i.e. genetic swamping, speciation reversal, hybrid speciation) and for establishing proper conservation measures. Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), which natively have a Holarctic distribution, have been introduced nearly worldwide due to game-farm and domestic pet releases. Their expanding range has resulted in secondary contact and increased incidences of hybridization with many closely related Mallard-like ducks that comprise the Mallard complex. Here, we assay molecular diversity for 19 nuclear introns and the mitochondrial DNA for wild Mallards (n = 50) across their Holarctic range and Yellow-billed Ducks (n = 30–75; Anas undulata) from southern Africa to determine population genetic structure and test for evidence of Mallard introgression into Yellow-billed Ducks. While we found limited support for contemporary gene flow across nuclear markers, we provide evidence from mitochondrial DNA that best supports ancient gene flow between Yellow-billed Ducks and Mallards. Yellow-billed Ducks best fit a single population at nuclear markers but show some location-specific mtDNA structure that suggests recent founder or bottleneck events. Although we find that introgression from Mallards into Yellow-billed Duck is limited, Yellow-billed Duck populations should be monitored to determine if expanding feral Mallard populations in southern Africa are increasing introgression.","http://academic.oup.com/condor/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/condor/duz042/29617619/duz042.pdf",""

A firm connection between melatonin at a physiologically relevant concentration and the gut microbiota and inflammation has recently established. Herein, we summarize their crosstalk and focus on four novelties. First, how melatonin is synthesized and degraded in the gut and exerts potentially diverse phenotypic effects through its diverse metabolites. Second, how melatonin mediates the activation and proliferation of intestinal mucosal immune cells with paracrine and autocrine properties. By modulating T/B cells, mast cells, macrophages and dendritic cells, melatonin immunomodulatory involved in regulating T‐cell differentiation, intervening T/B cell interaction and attenuating the production of pro‐inflammatory factors, achieving its antioxidant action via specific receptors. Third, how melatonin exerts antimicrobial action and modulates microbial components, such as lipopolysaccharide, amyloid‐β peptides via nuclear factor κ‐light‐chain‐enhancer of activated B cells (NF‐κB) or signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT1) pathway to modulate intestinal immune function in immune‐pineal axis. The last, how melatonin mediates the effect of intestinal bacterial activity signals on the body rhythm system through the NF‐κB pathway and influences the mucosal epithelium oscillation via clock gene expression. These processes are achieved at mitochondrial and nuclear levels to control the host immune cell development. Considering unclear mechanisms and undiscovered actions of melatonin in gut‐microbiome‐immune axis, it's time to reveal them and provide new insight for the outlook of melatonin as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment and management of intestinal diseases.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fmed.21628",""

Students reported on their behavioral re-engagement—or persistence following academic problems or failure, on the extent to which they experienced academic setbacks, and on their teachers’ involvement.

However, the association between authenticity and psychological functioning has not been examined, even though leisure is an ideal context within which to experience authenticity. Therefore, this study examined the association between authenticity and psychological functioning in older adults playing pickleball. A convenience sample of 112 males and 96 females (64.11±6.56, 50 to 82yrs) was recruited from the 2017 U.S. Open Pickleball Championship which is an annual international pickleball tournament. The participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire primarily asking about their levels of authenticity (4-items) and psychological functioning measured by both perceived stress (4-items) and happiness (single item). The pearson correlation tests found higher levels of authenticity were significantly correlated with being less stressed (r = -.373, p &lt; .01) and happier (r = .203, p &lt; .01). A two-step hierarchical regression was used to determine the unique contribution of authenticity to either perceived stress or happiness, and found that authenticity uniquely contributed to 10% of the variance in perceived stress (F= 4.678, p &lt;.001) and 2.3% of the variance in happiness (F= 3.046, p &lt;.01).

In this work, the screening of electrocatalytic activities of a series of single metallic iron, cobalt, and nickel nanoparticles and their binary and ternary alloys encapsulated in a graphitic carbon shell toward the OER, ORR, and HER in alkaline media is reported. Synthesis of these compounds proceeds by a two‐step sol–gel and carbothermal reduction procedure. Various ex situ characterizations show that with harsh electrochemical activation, the graphitic shell undergoes an electrochemical exfoliation. The modified electronic properties of the remaining graphene layers prevent their exfoliation, protect the bulk of the metallic cores, and participate in the electrocatalysis. The amount of near‐surface, higher‐oxidation‐state metals in the as‐prepared samples increases with electrochemical cycling, indicating that some metallic nanoparticles are not adequately encased within the graphite shell. Such surface oxide species provide secondary active sites for the electrocatalytic activities. The Ni–Fe binary system gives the most promising results for the OER, and the Co–Fe binary system shows the most promise for the ORR and HER.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Faenm.201903215",""

We further sought to determine the most effective measurement approaches of cognitive workload as well as quantify the conditions under which these measures are most effective for interpretation. Background:: Cognitive workload affects human performance, particularly when load is relatively high (overload) or low (underload). Despite ongoing interest in assessing cognitive workload through cardiac measures, it is currently unclear which cardiac-based assessments best indicate cognitive workload. Although several quantitative studies and qualitative reviews have sought to provide guidance, no meta-analytic integration of cardiac assessment(s) of cognitive workload exists to date. Method:: We used Morris and DeShon’s meta-analytic procedures to quantify the changes in cardiac measures due to task load conditions. Results:: Sample-weighted Cohen’s d values suggest that several metrics of cardiac activity demonstrate sensitivity in response to cognitive workload manipulations. Heart rate variability measures show sensitivity to task load, conditions of event rate, and task duration. Authors of future work should seek to quantify the utility of leveraging multiple metrics to understand workload. Conclusion:: Results suggest that assessment of cognitive workload can be done using various cardiac activity indicators. Further, given the number of valid and reliable measures available, researchers and practitioners should base their selection of a psychophysiological measure on the experimental and practical concerns inherent to their task/protocol. Applications:: Findings bear implications for future assessment of cognitive workload within basic and applied settings. Future research should seek to validate conditions under which measurements are best interpreted, including but not limited to individual differences.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0018720819830553",""

The use of social aspects, and more formally the method of social network analysis for research on social aspects of cancer is quite new. Although we paid special attention to articles that used formal social network analysis, we noted that those articles cover just over a quarter of the material we reviewed. Most articles that incorporated social aspects of cancer did not intend to formalize those aspects but treated the network concept as a way to characterize social support, social influence, or social responsibilities. Recent findings: We identified 74 recent articles that mentioned the network concept for research about cancer, excluding gene interaction networks. Of those 74 articles, 21 measured specific relationships between individuals or organizations and/or attributes of those individuals or organizations connected to participants or to others. Primary foci of the network analysis and nonnetwork analysis studies were breast cancer, social support for patients, and they usually at least considered sex and age of the cancer patients/survivors. Social media received some attention, and there were some studies considering quality of life and mental health. Among network analysis studies, size of network and number of people providing emotional/informational/instrumental support occurred in more than a couple studies but not the majority. There was little similarity among studies – whether using network analysis or not – suggesting that theory building and methodological development are in early stages. Summary: Implications of the review include opportunities for more systematic research using the network concept to understand people's experience of cancer as well as research on cancer.

For this to work, voters must be presented with credible alternatives from which to choose. In the United States, as in other weak‐party systems, the decision to challenge an incumbent representative rests with individual, strategic‐minded politicians who carefully weigh the available information. We investigate the role that one source of information—partisan media—plays in shaping electoral competition. We hypothesize that the haphazard expansion of the conservative Fox News Channel in the decade after its 1996 launch influenced congressional elections by affecting the decision calculus of high‐quality potential candidates. Using congressional district‐level data on the local availability of Fox News, we find that Fox News altered Republican potential candidates' perceptions about the vulnerability of Democratic incumbents, thereby changing their entry patterns.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fajps.12478",""

These pathways are intertwined and the microbial community and the volatile organic acids (VOCs) that evolve in ground beef are dynamic. Evaluation of microbial growth using traditional culture-dependent techniques can be misleading due to the presence of unculturable organisms. Therefore, utilizing culture-independent techniques allows for a more thorough understanding of the microbial community within a meat matrix during storage life. The objective of this study was to employ 16s rRNA amplicon sequencing and VOC identification using GC–MS to explore diversity and changes of the microbial community and VOC production during shelf-life of ground beef.Materials and MethodsFinely ground beef (80/20) was procured from beef processing facilities in the West (one lot) and Midwest (two lots). The lots were separated into three physically separate replicates. Ground beef lots were transported in chub packaging to Colorado State University (Fort Collins, CO), and the chubs were stored in the dark at 2°C for either 16/17 d or 23/24 d. After dark storage, chubs were reground, and 454 g fluff-packs were placed on polystyrene trays before overwrapping with polyvinyl chloride film. The trays were placed in retail display cases maintained at 2–4°C for 5 d. Samples were collected every day of retail display for evaluation of the microbial community and VOC development. Following standardized extraction, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was used to explore microbial communities. Sequencing data were analyzed using the programs in the QIIME2 (version 2018.4) pipeline. Similarly, volatile organic compounds were extracted prior to analysis of targeted VOCs using a GC–MS. The project was designed as a split-plot design and was analyzed using R packages (version 3.4.3), lme4, lmerTest, and emmeans. Least squares means were separated using an α of 0.05.ResultsThe top orders of bacteria found in the meat samples were from Enterobacteriales, Lactobacillales, and Pseudomonadales. No differences (P ≥ 0.05) in Faith’s Phylogenetic Diversity Index, or a measure of diversity of the bacterial species within a sample, were observed between Days 0, 2, and 4 of retail case display. A targeted analysis identified eighteen VOCs associated with ground beef spoilage. In previous studies, the presence of hexanal, acetoin and acetic acid are identified as spoilage indicators. Hexanal, Acetoin and acetic acid increased (P ≤ 0.05) over the 5 d of retail display.ConclusionThe use of 16s rRNA amplicon sequencing technology is a relatively recent tool that has rapidly advanced the study of microbial deterioration during beef storage and shelf-life. Moreover, the combination of 16s rRNA amplicon sequencing and identification of VOCs in this study, afforded an exploration of the relationship between chemical and biological changes which occur during ground beef storage. These analytical technologies, when used in unison, can highlight the dynamic relationships and evolution of chemical and biological constituents in ground beef. Further research in ground beef shelf-life should incorporate such measures.","https://www.iastatedigitalpress.com/mmb/article/10794/galley/10228/download/",""

It is therefore important to study within-sample co-methylation, ie, methylation patterns between consecutive sites in a chromosome. In this article, we develop 2 new methods to compare co-methylation patterns between normal and cancerous breast samples. In particular, we investigate the co-methylation patterns of 4 different methylation states/levels separately. Using these 2 methods, we focus on addressing the following questions: How often does 1 methylation state change to other methylation states and how is this change dependent on chromosome distance? What co-methylation patterns do normal and cancerous breast samples have? Do genomic sites with different methylation states/levels have different co-methylation patterns? Our results show that cancerous and normal co-methylation patterns are significantly different. We find that this difference exists even when the physical distance of 2 sites are less than 50 bases. Breast cancer cell lines tend to remain in the same methylation state more often than normal samples, especially for the no/low or high/full methylation states. We also find that the co-methylation region lengths for various methylation states (no/low, partial, and high/full methylation states) are very different. For example, the co-methylation region lengths for partial methylation regions are shorter than the unmethylated or fully methylated regions. Our research may provide a deep understanding of co-methylation patterns. These co-methylation patterns will aid in discovering and understanding new methylation events that may be related to novel biomarkers.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1176935119880516",""

Understanding how these cytonuclear interactions drive molecular evolution and generate genetic incompatibilities between isolated populations and species is of central importance to eukaryotic biology. Plants are an outstanding system to investigate such effects because of their two different genomic compartments present in the cytoplasm (mitochondria and plastids) and the extensive resources detailing subcellular targeting of nuclear-encoded proteins. However, the field lacks a consistent classification scheme for mitochondrial- and plastid-targeted proteins based on their molecular interactions with cytoplasmic genomes and gene products, which hinders efforts to standardize and compare results across studies. Here, we take advantage of detailed knowledge about the model angiosperm Arabidopsis thaliana to provide a curated database of plant cytonuclear interactions at the molecular level. CyMIRA (Cytonuclear Molecular Interactions Reference for Arabidopsis) is available at http://cymira.colostate.edu/ and https://github.com/dbsloan/cymira and will serve as a resource to aid researchers in partitioning evolutionary genomic data into functional gene classes based on organelle targeting and direct molecular interaction with cytoplasmic genomes and gene products. It includes 11 categories (and 27 subcategories) of different cytonuclear complexes and types of molecular interactions, and it reports residue-level information for cytonuclear contact sites.

Few scholars, however, have investigated the full picture of the hazards in policing, which includes deaths occurring in both felonious and nonfelonious circumstances. In this study, we examine nearly 50 years of all police officer line‐of‐duty deaths (1970–2016) using data from the Officer Down Memorial Page. We focus on long‐term trends in felonious and nonfelonious deaths annually, as well as on trends in incident‐level characteristics. We also employ interrupted time‐series analysis (ARIMA) to test the “war on cops” thesis post–Ferguson. Policy Implications: The number of line‐of‐duty deaths has declined dramatically over the last five decades. Policing is a much safer profession now than it was 50 years ago. Despite a 75% drop in deaths, however, there has been remarkable stability in geographic‐, temporal‐, and incident‐level characteristics. Also, several notable changes over time reflect favorably on improved safety in policing, such as declines in deaths resulting from aircraft crashes and accidental gunfire. Other trends are troubling, though, such as the stability in deaths during auto pursuits and a two‐fold increase in deaths from vehicular assaults. Currently, the “war on cops” thesis is not supported by any evidence, and we apply the 50‐year lens in this study to provide important context for understanding recent trends in officer deaths.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2F1745-9133.12408",""

Unlike the direct therapeutic targeting of tumor cells, cancer immunotherapy is a new strategy that boosts the host's immune system to detect specific cancer cells for efficient elimination. Nanoparticles incorporating immunomodulatory agents can activate immune cells and modulate the tumor microenvironment to enhance antitumor immunity. Such nanoparticle‐based cancer immunotherapies have received considerable attention and have been extensively studied in recent years. This review thus focuses on nanoparticle‐based platforms (especially naturally derived nanoparticles and synthetic nanoparticles) utilized in recent advances; summarizes delivery systems that incorporate various immune‐modulating agents, including peptides and nucleic acids, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and other small immunostimulating agents; and introduces combinational cancer immunotherapy with nanoparticles, especially nanoparticle‐based photo‐immunotherapy and nanoparticle‐based chemo‐immunotherapy. Undoubtedly, the recent studies introduced in this review prove that nanoparticle‐incorporated cancer immunotherapy is a highly promising treatment modality for patients with cancer. Nonetheless further research is needed to solve safety concerns and improve efficacy of nanoplatform‐based cancer immunotherapy for future clinical application.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fwnan.1590",""

We then provide a predictive test of the measure by applying it to a sample of more than 3,000 CEOs of S&P 1500 firms to explore the direct and interactive effects of CEOs' Big Five personality traits and firm performance on strategic change. Our validated, unobtrusive measure of CEOs' Big Five traits provides a strong foundation for future theory development on the firm‐level effects of CEOs' personality traits. Our specific findings also extend our understanding of how CEO personality influences firm‐level change and how both person and situation‐based factors interact to jointly influence firm strategy. This paper introduces a language‐based tool we developed to measure the Big Five personality traits (i.e., openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) of more than 3,000 CEOs of S&P 1500 firms. After describing our process to develop and validate the tool, we test it by examining how CEOs' Big Five traits influence strategic change, both in isolation and in combination with recent firm performance. Our results suggest that CEOs' personality traits have a meaningful impact on strategic change, but that the nature of these effects differs based on their firms' recent performance. Our tool also provides a strong basis for scholars seeking to measure the personality traits of large samples of public‐company executives.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fsmj.3023",""

The importance of using R/S as a coping strategy can be amplified in the context of a correctional setting. While some attention has focused on the effectiveness of faith-based services in jails and prisons, very little emphasis has been placed on using those constructs in psychotherapy within the correctional context. Accordingly, this article explores the application of the multicultural orientation framework—including the important tenets of therapists’ cultural humility, cultural comfort, and cultural opportunities—into psychotherapy practices with incarcerated individuals. In doing so, we will focus on how cultural humility can assist in addressing intersecting identities, including spirituality, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), and gender identity to enhance the process and outcome of therapy. We will discuss how cultural humility can be effectively used to address common challenges for therapists when working with R/S issues in corrections and conclude with two case studies to illustrate the application.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0091647119847540",""

Two such measures–integration, I(X), and interaction complexity, CI(X)–have been previously applied to electroencephalographic (EEG) signals recorded during ongoing wakeful brain states. Here, I(X) and CI(X) were computed for empirical and simulated visually-elicited alpha-range (8–13 Hz) EEG signals. Integration and complexity of evoked (stimulus-locked) and induced (non-stimulus-locked) EEG responses were assessed using nonparametric k-th nearest neighbor (KNN) entropy estimation, which is robust to the nonstationarity of stimulus-elicited EEG signals. KNN-based I(X) and CI(X) were also computed for the alpha-range EEG of ongoing wakeful brain states. I(X) and CI(X) patterns differentiated between induced and evoked EEG signals and replicated previous wakeful EEG findings obtained using Gaussian-based entropy estimators. Absolute levels of I(X) and CI(X) were related to absolute levels of alpha-range EEG power and phase synchronization, but stimulus-related changes in the information-theoretic and other EEG properties were independent. These findings support the hypothesis that visual perception and ongoing wakeful mental states emerge from complex, dynamical interaction among segregated and integrated brain networks operating near an optimal balance between order and disorder.","https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/21/1/61/pdf",""

However, access to original research data is an ongoing dilemma in various disciplines, including human resource development. The Solution: Scholars and scholar-practitioners have the opportunity to evaluate the credibility of previous studies without access to the original raw data. The use of descriptive statistics from published research offers an alternative to assess the reproducibility and robustness of selected prior research. The Stakeholders: In addition to validating research before applying implications for practice in the field, practitioners could benefit from working with scholars and scholar-practitioners by assessing analytic robustness and reevaluating data through a new framework to address burgeoning organizational problems, potentially saving resources. Scholars can reimagine conceptual frameworks based on advances to theory and statistical analyses capabilities. For emerging scholars, the ability to validate prior research or apply new models using the information contained in a publication can create a learning opportunity to understand statistical analyses.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1523422319869853",""

From the electronic structure and complex dielectric function analysis, the V doping causes the reduction of the bandgap by inducing the localized V [Formula: see text] state in the NiO bandgap region, and the first optical transition for V-doped NiO occurs at a lower frequency than the one for the intrinsic NiO. The bandgap shrinkage to about 2 eV makes NiO when doped with V a potential candidate for visible light range application in photocatalytic applications. The resulting effects on refractive index, reflectivity, absorption, optical conductivity and loss function for V-doped NiO are compared to those of pristine NiO.","https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S2047684119500076",""

Two such measures–integration, I(X), and interaction complexity, CI(X)–have been previously applied to electroencephalographic (EEG) signals recorded during ongoing wakeful brain states. Here, I(X) and CI(X) were computed for empirical and simulated visually-elicited alpha-range (8–13 Hz) EEG signals. Integration and complexity of evoked (stimulus-locked) and induced (non-stimulus-locked) EEG responses were assessed using nonparametric k-th nearest neighbor (KNN) entropy estimation, which is robust to the nonstationarity of stimulus-elicited EEG signals. KNN-based I(X) and CI(X) were also computed for the alpha-range EEG of ongoing wakeful brain states. I(X) and CI(X) patterns differentiated between induced and evoked EEG signals and replicated previous wakeful EEG findings obtained using Gaussian-based entropy estimators. Absolute levels of I(X) and CI(X) were related to absolute levels of alpha-range EEG power and phase synchronization, but stimulus-related changes in the information-theoretic and other EEG properties were independent. These findings support the hypothesis that visual perception and ongoing wakeful mental states emerge from complex, dynamical interaction among segregated and integrated brain networks operating near an optimal balance between order and disorder.","https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/21/1/61/pdf",""

We present a case of upper gastrointestinal bleed resulting from delayed pharyngoesophageal perforation due to loosened screw in the presence of normally positioned hardware. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS:: A 43-year-old male with hypertension, bradycardia status post pacemaker, cervical stenosis status post C3 -C6 fusion 1 year prior came to the ER with chief complaint of throat and chest pain followed by one episode of hematemesis noticing a 2 cm screw in vomitus. Initial vitals showed T 36.4, HR 78, BP 139/94, RR 18, and SpO2 96% on RA. Cervical spine x-ray showed intact plate of cervical spine with missing screw. Patient was admitted to the ICU and gastroenterology was consulted. Gastrografin swallow study did not show extravasation of contrast and subsequent endoscopy showed extensive soft tissue swelling in the left hypopharynx without purulent exudate. Bedside fiberoptic laryngoscopy showed left pharyngeal posterior wall prominence extending from inferior to tonsil to tip of epiglottis with intact overlying mucosa. Head and neck surgeon recommended non-operative intervention, so the patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics through the PICC line. He was started on clear liquid diet and advanced to full liquids. His blood count remained stable and he had no further hematemesis. Outpatient follow up showed satisfactory recovery. DISCUSSION:: Pharyngoesophageal injuries following ACDF are rare with an incidence of <2%. Most perforations are identified in immediate or early postoperative period and result from iatrogenic injury during the procedure and carry high mortality rates. Early local symptoms include neck swelling, dysphagia, fever and subcutaneous emphysema leading to mediastinitis. Fistula formation, microcytic anemia and neck mass are the most common late presentations. Xray of the neck, contrast swallow studies and flexible endoscopy can help locate perforation. When conservative treatment fails or there is systemic involvement, this requires hardware removal, debridement and suture closure of the defect with or without sternocleidomastoid muscle, superior omohyoid muscle, or pertoralis major flap enforcement to reduce the risk of failure. Patients presenting with upper GI bleed, signs of neck infection, and history of cervical spine plating should be evaluated for hardware-related complications.","https://journals.lww.com/10.14309/01.ajg.0000596344.81047.d5",""

The injected gas builds a gas cap that drives the oil to the (upper) oil-producing wells while the bottom water-drainage wells control water cresting. The hybrid process of GDWS-AGD process has been first developed and tested in vertical wells to minimize water cut in reservoirs with bottom water drive and strong water coning tendencies. The wells were dual-completed with 7-inch production casing and 2-3/8 inch tubings and perforated above the oil-water contact (OWC) for oil production and below OWC for water drainage. The two completions were hydraulically isolated inside the well by a packer.

We use Fligstein and McAdam's theory of fields to posit that the changing conditions in which humanities faculty members work reflect activities in overlapping (the academic profession more generally) and proximate (university administration) fields. We seek to illuminate the ways in which humanities faculty experience heightened administrative authority and strategically respond. Research Questions: We ask: 1) How do faculty members in the humanities understand the changes in their field? 2) How do faculty members in the humanities understand their relationships to members of overlapping (e.g., faculty in other areas) and proximate (e.g., administrators) fields? and 3) How do faculty members in the humanities strategize to improve their positions? Participants: We conducted semistructured interviews with 46 faculty members in humanities fields with various appointments (tenured, tenure-track, non-tenure-track). Faculty participants were mainly housed in English and history, two of the largest humanities departments at many institutions, but also in philosophy and religion departments. Research Design: Our multiple case study design took place at two public research universities to understand how faculty respond to changing conditions. The research sites, typical of many public research universities, experienced declining direct government support and therefore conditions in which academic capitalist processes occur were present at both. Humanities departments contributed a large portion of student credit-hour production at both research sites, yet such funds were centralized and allocated by university administration. Data Collection and Analysis: Our interview protocol focused on faculty perceptions of resource allocation within the institution, allocation of work within the department, perceptions of the department relative to others, and how faculty structured their time and careers in response to various pressures inside and outside of their university. Semistructured interviews ranged from 25 and 90 minutes and were recorded and transcribed. We analyzed data using a priori and emergent codes which were grouped into broad themes reflecting faculty responses to changing conditions. Results: Three strategic responses emerged among humanities faculty members we interviewed: utilizing lower status faculty members, exploiting weaker units in the field, and forming alliances. Conclusions/Recommendations: Strategies result in the improved status of some individual faculty members but do not arrest the diminishing status of the humanities as a field. Our analysis suggests that field-level analyses entail implications for the study of academic work and processes in the academic capitalism tradition.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/016146811912100905",""

Methods:: The authors collected survey data from 77 respondents using a mixed-methods survey research design. These data were used to determine the VISSIT’s validity and reliability. Participants represented urban, suburban, and rural geographic regions across 20 U.S. states. Results:: The results of the national study showed that the VISSIT has social validity, which was supported by both ease of use and acceptability of the tool. The VISSIT’s consequential and content validity were also supported by the data collected. The internal consistency reliability showed reliability for the VISSIT with a Cronbach’s alpha calculated as being .935. Based on the results presented here, in which the social, consequential, and content validity of the VISSIT have been confirmed, it can also be confidently asserted that the VISSIT is construct valid. Discussion:: The findings of this national study indicate an overall positive response to the usability and understandability of the VISSIT. Participants used the tool to provide quantifiable documentation to identify accurate student need for service across all expanded core curriculum areas as well as to provide administrators and families with research-based data to justify service type and time. Implications for practitioners:: Respondents in the national study saw the VISSIT as an effective way to take student evaluation data and convert those results into a measurable recommendation for service type and intensity. The VISSIT helps a teacher of students with visual impairments to document how much time is needed for both direct and collaborative consultation services, as appropriate for each individual student.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0145482X19845756",""

Multiple circumstances such as disasters and environmental events brought about by climate change impair the ability of older adults to maintain healthy physical and psychological well-being. Unfortunately, during these times, public and individual emergency preparation plans often fall short of having the needed resources to reach out and offer assistance to older adults. Co-sponsored by the Environmental Gerontology and Disasters and Older Adults Interest Groups, four presenters will highlight multiple circumstances where older adults face serious physical and psychological consequences as a result of climate change issues: 1) the loss of electrical power and its impact on hypothermia and hyperthermia in older adults, 2) the loss of basic public health services after Hurricane Maria and its contribution to older adults’ reduced psychological well-being including increased levels of suicide, 3) homeless older adults experiencing a disaster and their resulting increased need for resources, and 4) older adults in the path of violent tornadoes and their ability to cope on their own. These presenters will discuss actions, interventions, and development of emergency disaster preparation plans that would be beneficial for older adult response and recovery. The fifth paper will review the theoretical backgrounds of and previous studies on Anthropocene with a focus on climate change policy and practice. Collectively, these papers will address various means by which older adults are affected by climate change and optimal practices to speed recovery.","http://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/3/Supplement_1/S541/33007307/igz038.1989.pdf",""

The mechanisms that contribute to OA are poorly understood and disease modifying treatments have not been identified. A critical shortcoming in developing therapies is the limited number of translational models available to identify the causes of naturally occurring OA. Our goal is to use the common marmoset as a non-human primate (NHP) model of age-related OA. NHP are the closest evolutionary relative to humans and share many characteristics of human aging. The marmoset has advantages over other NHP for aging research because of their relatively short maximal lifespan and small size. Micro-computed tomography (uCT) was performed on whole-knee joints obtained from young (10 yrs, n=3) marmosets at necropsy. OA was evaluated using a clinical uCT scoring system and quantitative assessments of subchondral bone structure and ossified meniscal volume. Advancing age was positively correlated to increased uCT OA score (p&lt;0.05, r=0.59 ), mainly through increased number and size of osteophytes and progressive subchondral bone sclerosis from the medial to both medial and lateral compartments. For marmosets displaying meniscal ossification, older marmosets had greater (p&lt;0.05) ossified meniscal volume than middle-aged and younger marmosets, respectively. Trabecular (p=0.05) and cortical bone thickness (p&lt;0.05) were also lower in older marmosets. These data are the first to indicate that the marmoset develops naturally occurring, age-related OA and support the pursuit of additional studies using the marmoset to identify OA mechanisms and test potential interventions.","http://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/3/Supplement_1/S104/32998351/igz038.390.pdf",""

While many studies have attempted to identify different methods to adapt pavements to future climate conditions, the potential economic impacts of the adaptations still remain largely unquantified. This study presents the results of a comprehensive life‐cycle cost analysis (LCCA) aimed at quantifying the potential economic impacts of a climate adaptation method, in which an upgraded asphalt binder (Performance Grade PG 76‐22) is used in the construction and maintenance of flexible pavement sections in lieu of the original binder (PG 70‐22) for improved resistance against high temperatures. For each of three major Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) districts with different climates, three case studies consisting of typical interstate, primary, and secondary pavement sections were considered. The LCCA accounted for the costs incurred during the mixture's production, maintenance, and use phases of the pavement life cycle by explicitly considering future climate projections, pavement life‐cycle performance, maintenance effects, and work zone user delays. The study concludes that pavements using the upgraded binder not only perform better over time but are also economically advantageous compared to those with the original binder under the conditions of the anticipated future climate conditions (2020–2039).","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fjiec.12936",""

One mutation that impairs these interactions does not significantly affect viral RNA replication but selectively abolishes virion assembly, demonstrating the specific role of these interactions in virus morphogenesis. We also show that the 3ʹ UTR of ZIKV RNA may serve as a “recruitment signal” through binding to NS2A to enter the virion assembly site. Following a coordinated cleavage of C-prM-E at the virion assembly site, NS2A may present the viral RNA to C protein for nucleocapsid formation followed by envelopment with prM/E proteins.

In the U.S., inequality is mostly due to unobserved differences within occupations and has grown in large part because of higher earnings among high-skilled workers. Our results highlight that the effects of occupational structure are generally more pronounced at lower levels of economic development. At the higher level of economic development found in the U.S., inequality appears to increase largely due to rising inequality among high-skilled employees, which may be a function of unobserved organizational variables such as firm productivity and market advantage.","http://www.scielo.br/pdf/rec/v23n3/1980-5527-rec-23-03-e192331.pdf",""

The availability of the WT parental strain of 17D, Asibi virus, and large quantities of clinical data showing the effectiveness of the 17D vaccine make this WT parent/vaccine pair an excellent model for investigating RNA virus attenuation. Here, we investigate a mechanism of 17D attenuation and show that the vaccine virus is resistant to the antiviral compound ribavirin. The findings suggest that attenuation is in part due to a low probability of reversion or mutation of the vaccine virus genome to WT, thus maintaining a stable genotype despite external pressures.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/mBio.02294-19",""

Here we identify cell cycle and apoptosis regulator 2 (CCAR2) as an early target for acetylation in colon cancer cells treated with sulforaphane. N-terminal acetylation of CCAR2 diminished its interactions with histone deacetylase 3 and β-catenin, interfering with Wnt coactivator functions of CCAR2, including in cells harboring genetically encoded CCAR2 acetylation. Protein domain arrays and pull-down assays identified acetyl “reader” proteins that recognized CCAR2 acetylation sites, including BRD9 and members of the bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) family. Treatment with the BET inhibitor JQ1 synergized with sulforaphane in colon cancer cells and suppressed tumor development effectively in a preclinical model of colorectal cancer. Studies with sulforaphane+JQ1 in combination implicated a BET/BRD9 acetyl switch and a shift in the pool of acetyl “reader” proteins in favor of BRD9-regulated target genes. Significance:: These results highlight the competition that exists among the “readers” of acetylated histone and nonhistone proteins and provide a mechanistic basis for potential new therapeutic avenues involving epigenetic combination treatments.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/79/5/918/2790050/918.pdf",""

Research into the honor-suicide link has suggested explanatory factors that coincide with the interpersonal theory of suicide, such as untreated depression, heightened risk-taking, and the use of firearms in suicide; however, factors related to aging (e.g., ageism, anxiety about aging) have yet to be examined. The present study examined ambivalent ageism, permissive attitudes toward suicide, and interpersonal risk-factors for suicide as explanations for the honor-suicide link among a sample of 201 older American men (Mage = 56.45, SD = 8.35, range = 44-77 years of age). After controlling for participant age and religiosity, participants with greater endorsement of honor ideology but lower levels of honor fulfillment expressed heightened levels of thwarted belongingness (β = 0.35, p = .001)—an established interpersonal risk-factor for suicide. Additionally, lower levels of honor fulfillment predicted greater anxiety about aging (β = -0.41, p &lt; .001), greater perceived burdensomeness (β = -0.39, p &lt; .001), and more positive implicit attitudes toward youth (β = 0.27, p = .019). Conversely, greater levels of honor fulfillment predicted more positive attitudes toward aging (β = 0.20, p = .025). Our results extend previous research on the honor-suicide relationship by demonstrating the utility of marrying the interpersonal theory of suicide with research on cultures of honor.","http://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/3/Supplement_1/S311/33002169/igz038.1138.pdf",""

However, when resources are shared ecologically, economically, or through a common, global interest, policies implemented to protect resource sustainability in one domain can displace, and in some cases magnify, environmental degradation to other domains. Although such displacement has been recognized as a fundamental challenge to environmental and conservation policy within some resource sectors, there has been little cross‐disciplinary and cross‐sectoral integration to address the problem. This suggests that siloed knowledge may be impeding widespread recognition of the ubiquity of displacement and the need for mitigation. Here, we connect research across multiple disciplines to promote a broader discussion and recognition of the processes and pathways that can lead to displaced impacts that countermand or undermine resource policy and outline a number of approaches that can mitigate displacement.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/conl.12628",""

Previously, RFX showed activity against Clostridiodes difficile (C. difficile) recurrences post treatment with little overall impact on the normal fecal microbiota. Additional studies have found that while exposure to systemic antibiotics was associated with infection with multi drug-resistant organisms, such as VRE, exposure to only RFX was not. RFX has become widely used in hospitalized patients with advanced liver disease (ALD) who have refractory hepatic encephalopathy, but the impact of therapy on the occurrence of C. difficile and VRE is not well established. Methods: ALD patients in the Vizient Clinical Database-Resource Manager (CDB-RM®) were identified based on ICD 10 and MS-DRG codes from January to December 2018. The data were further stratified based on receipt of RFX, documentation of C. difficile or VRE, and hospital type (academic medical centers, complex care medical centers or community hospitals). Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare C. difficile rates while paired samples t-test was used to compare VRE. Chi-square analysis was used to evaluate differences in RFX use by hospital type. Results: A total of 527,534 cases from 419 acute care hospitals were included in the ALD cohort. The frequency of C. difficile occurrence in patients who received RFX was lower than those who did not receive RFX (3.8% vs 4.3%, respectively, P = 0.25), However, VRE frequency was significantly lower in those that received RFX (0.43 cases per 10,000 patient-days) vs. the overall ALD population (2.3 cases per 10,000 patient-days) (P < 0.05). Percentage of ALD cases receiving RFX in the academic medical centers, complex care medical centers and community hospitals was 11.94%, 4.87%, and 8.76%, respectively (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Patients with ALD who received RFX had a significantly lower frequency of documented VRE. There was a trend in the reduction in documented C. difficile, but this did not reach statistical significance. Utilization of RFX varied significantly by institutional type. These results support further studies on the relationship between receipt of RFX and protective effects against C. difficile and VRE in patients with ALD.

Surgeons should be aware of appropriate management and surgical techniques for addressing frontal sinus fractures. Herein, we review the presentation and management of frontal sinus fractures, including conservative, endoscopic, and open surgical techniques.","http://www.thieme-connect.de/products/ejournals/pdf/10.1055/s-0039-3399521.pdf",""

The sandwich beams are constructed from balsa wood in the core and high strength steel wire and E-glass fiber reinforced polymer composite in the facings. The testing of these beams is performed using a monotonic static four-point loading to failure in accordance with ASTM C393-00. Local strain distribution in the mid-span of the beams is obtained using strain gauges. Mid-span deflections of the beams are real-time measured using linear variable displacement transducer (LVDT). From the experimental results, flexural properties of the beams are calculated, including bending stiffness, bending strength, core shear strength, and facing modulus, core modulus, etc. The experimental results have shown that the beams have all failed in the compression zone by local buckling of the top face and shear of the core. The bottom skin does not exhibit any type of premature failure or distress. No bond failure of the composite in the tension zone is observed in any of the tested beams. Finite element modeling of the beam has been conducted using ANSYS. The mechanical properties of the skin and core material used in finite element modeling have been determined by testing of coupons. The predicted results are compared to experimental results, with a reasonable agreement.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2019-11845/6513656/v009t11a018-imece2019-11845.pdf",""

Our study suggests an alternative corporate‐level view, where entry by multiunit firms must consider sister units as well as rivals in the market. Theorizing about a sharing mechanism between sister units distinct from a spillover mechanism between rivals, we expect that multiunit firms locate new units nearer sister vis‐à‐vis rival units and that the size, quality, and organizational form of a new unit moderate these associations. Finally, we predict that multiunit firms establish new units distant from same‐brand and same‐market‐segment sister units. We find robust empirical support from the geographic distance decisions of 10 multiunit hotel firms in 20 U.S. cities. Where should multiunit firms (e.g., fast‐food chains, hotels) locate new business units relative to others? Current competitive‐level‐strategy perspective argues new units should locate “far‐from‐others” if they have superior capabilities (to avoid being imitated) and “near‐others” if inferior ones (to better imitate others). We instead examine this phenomenon from a corporate‐level‐strategy perspective, regarding locally available synergies sister units can garner to better compete. We argue that new units locate nearer sister (i.e., business‐units of same‐parent firms) than rival units; that this effect is stronger if new units are larger, have better quality, and are company‐operated rather than franchised; and that this base effect is weaker when sisters belong to same‐ rather than different‐brand companies of the same parent‐firm.

Through iteratively computing the Hessian inverse, least-squares migration enables us to reduce the point-spread-function effects and improve the image resolution and amplitude fidelity. By incorporating anisotropy in the 2D elastic wave equation, we have developed an elastic least-squares reverse time migration (LSRTM) method for multicomponent data from the vertically transversely isotropic (VTI) media. Using the perturbed stiffness parameters [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] as PP and PS reflectivities, we linearize the elastic VTI wave equation and obtain a Born modeling (demigration) operator. Then, we use the Lagrange multiplier method to derive the corresponding adjoint wave equation and reflectivity kernels. With linearized forward modeling and adjoint migration operators, we solve a linear inverse problem to estimate the subsurface reflectivity models for [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. To reduce the artifacts caused by data over-fitting, we introduce total-variation regularization into the reflectivity inversion, which promotes a sparse solution in terms of the model derivatives. To accelerate the convergence of LSRTM, we use source illumination to approximate the diagonal Hessian and use it as a preconditioner for the misfit gradient. Numerical examples help us determine that our elastic VTI LSRTM method can improve the spatial resolution and amplitude fidelity in comparison to adjoint migration.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/geo2018-0887.1",""
