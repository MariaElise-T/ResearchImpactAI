The SV40 large T‐antigen (T‐ag), a member of the SF3 family of helicases, is essential for SV40 DNA replication. We have recently reported a real‐time assay for monitoring T‐ag helicase activity using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). In this current study, optimization of the duplex and quadruplex DNA unwinding assay for T‐ag has been carried out. The influence of varying contact time between helicase and DNA substrates, T‐ag and ATP concentrations, and salt/buffer compositions on DNA unwinding were determined. Higher ionic strength decreased the efficiency of unwinding. Optimal contact time depended on the length of DNA substrate to be unwound and the sequence of DNA; DNA substrates containing the SV40 origin sequence were bound much more tightly than random sequence oligonucleotides, but unwound much more slowly, if at all, under the assay conditions. Of particular importance is the improved direct observation of quadruplex DNA substrate unwinding, in which no secondary reporter of unwinding is required. Future studies will investigate the real‐time inhibition of this quadruplex DNA helicase activity, with potential implications for small‐molecule regulation of gene function.","",""

Mean annual home ranges for bobcats (171 males, 214 females) from 29 populations covering the entire north to south and east to west range demonstrated female home-range sizes varied more than an order of magnitude and that, on average, males maintained home ranges 1.65 times the size of females.

These factors were: (1) vowel identity, (2) vowel space expansion (emphasis) or reduction (fast rate), and a hypothesized (3) ‘deeper’ and ‘shallower’ stop closure contact in emphatic and faster speech, respectively. The objective of the current research was to conceptually and quantitatively unify these two studies. This was accomplished by showing that the opposite changes to frequency onsets of F2 transitions due to emphatic and rapid speech systematically vary as a function of the durational changes in the stop closure interval. Specifically, the decrease in coarticulation in emphatic speech is characterized by increases in F2 onsets and longer stop closures (relative to a normal baseline); the increase in coarticulation due to rapid speech shows concomitant decreases in F2 onsets coinciding with shorter stop closure intervals. Vocal tract area function simulations corresponding to emphatic and reduced speech implicitly support ‘deeper’ and ‘shallower’ closure contacts as a third factor contributing to the overall extent of anticipatory CV coarticulation.","https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1159/000235660/xml",""

Unfortunately, inconsistent guidance exists to guide researchers through the use of this tool in a manner compatible with accepted methods used to validate constructs in a rigorous manner. The authors review research using content analysis to examine the extent to which such studies integrate methods for assessing content, external, discriminant, and predictive validity.

If the lateral variation in subsurface structure is smooth, the data are well compressed in the 2D coupled plane-wave domain, reducing computation costs and stabilizing the inversion procedure. Surface multiples and primaries are well separated in the inverse coupled plane-wave domain, and multiples can be eliminated by simple muting, which does not damage the primary energy. To reduce artifacts, wraparound, and noise introduced by the frequency-domain data matrix inversion, horizontal and vertical tapers are applied. A least-squares matrix inversion method is chosen to stabilize the inversion.

Family background (divorced vs. intact families) moderates the relationship between relationship quality and adjustment; youth from divorced families indicate that their relationships with their maternal grandmothers are more salient to their adjustment than do youth from intact families. These findings suggest that the bonds young people develop with their maternal grandmothers following their parents' divorce may positively affect their psychological functioning.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0192513X09334913",""

In MDS-MAP(P), a local map is built at each node of the immediate vicinity, then these maps are merged together to form a global map. MDS-Hybrid uses MDS-MAP(C) to relatively localize Nr reference nodes. Then, an absolute localization method uses these Nr nodes as anchors to localize the rest of the network. Finally, RangeQ-MDS assumes the absence of an RSSI-distance mapping function. It uses a quantized RSSI-based distance estimation technique (called RangeQ) to achieve more precise hop distances than other range-free approaches do. While MDS-MAP(C), MDS-MAP(P), and MDSHybrid can be range-aware or range-free, RangeQ-MDS is partially range-aware.","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=25585",""

A standardized black raspberry extract (BRE) has been effective in reducing signaling pathways commonly initiated by inflammatory stimuli. In this study, we determined whether this extract could reduce cutaneous UVB-induced inflammation and carcinogenesis. In our carcinogenesis model, female SKH-1 hairless mice were exposed to one minimal erythemal dose of UVB thrice weekly on nonconsecutive days for 25 weeks. Immediately after each exposure, the mice were treated topically with either BRE dissolved in vehicle or with vehicle only. Beginning on week 19, mice treated with BRE had a significant reduction in tumor number and in average tumor size. This reduction correlated with a significant reduction in tumor-infiltrating CD3+foxp3+ regulatory T-cells. In the acute model, mice were exposed to a single minimal erythemal dose of UVB and treated topically with BRE or with vehicle. At 48 hours post-UVB exposure, topical BRE treatment significantly reduced edema, p53 protein levels, oxidative DNA damage, and neutrophil activation. The ability of topical BRE to reduce acute UVB-induced inflammation and to decrease tumor development in a long-term model provides compelling evidence to explore the clinical efficacy of BRE in the prevention of human skin cancers.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerpreventionresearch/article-pdf/2/7/665/2247617/665.pdf",""

The study results support the hypothesis that structural characteristics of a nation, such as social support and population growth, influence individuals’ sense of anomie. At the individual level, the results are consistent with Merton’s predictions about anomie and the reasoning of social support theory.

Consistent with this interest indicator model, across three studies both sexes were more likely to initiate humor and to respond more positively and consider the other person to be funny when initially attracted to that person. The findings support that humor dynamics— and not just humor displays—influence romantic chemistry for both men and women, suggesting that humor can ultimately function as a strategy to initiate and monitor social relationships.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0146167209334786",""

Both teachers believed that creating a text-rich atmosphere engages students' interests, social interactions around texts aid comprehension, and “best practices” such as guided reading and literature discussions are useful methods. Both teachers harshly criticized the continuous barrage of tests in their district (between 10 and 17 district-mandated benchmark assessments per nine-month school year). However, their practices differed dramatically and created inequitable educational opportunities. Students in the suburban setting spent more time socially constructing knowledge about texts, themes, and topics while students in the urban school spent more time individually practicing the skills necessary to achieve understanding of a text's inherent meaning.

Here, the optical properties of AlN epilayers, polycrystalline AlN, and bulk AlN single crystals have been investigated using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy to address the origin of this yellow appearance. An emission band with a linewidth of ∼0.3 eV (at 10 K) was observed at ∼2.78 eV. We propose that the origin of the yellow color in bulk AlN is due to a band-to-impurity absorption involving the excitation of electrons from the valence band to the doubly negative charged state, (VAl2−), of isolated aluminum vacancies, (VAl)3−/2− described by VAl2−+hν=VAl3−+h+.

Previously, it was assumed that fibers elongated as individual cells. In contrast, observation by cryo-field emission-scanning electron microscopy of cotton fibers developing in situ within the boll demonstrated that fibers elongate within tissue-like bundles. These bundles were entrained by twisting fiber tips and consolidated by adhesion of a cotton fiber middle lamella (CFML). The fiber bundles consolidated via the CFML ultimately formed a packet of fiber around each seed, which helps explain how thousands of cotton fibers achieve their great length within a confined space. The cell wall nature of the CFML was characterized using transmission electron microscopy, including polymer epitope labeling. Toward the end of elongation, up-regulation occurred in gene expression and enzyme activities related to cell wall hydrolysis, and targeted breakdown of the CFML restored fiber individuality. At the same time, losses occurred in certain cell wall polymer epitopes (as revealed by comprehensive microarray polymer profiling) and sugars within noncellulosic matrix components (as revealed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of derivatized neutral and acidic glycosyl residues). Broadly, these data show that adhesion modulated by an outer layer of the primary wall can coordinate the extensive growth of a large group of cells and illustrate dynamic changes in primary wall structure and composition occurring during the differentiation of one cell type that spends only part of its life as a tissue.","http://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-pdf/150/2/684/38104305/plphys_v150_2_684.pdf",""

All PCR primers were specific for ‘Ca. L. psyllaurous’ and ‘Ca. L. solanacearum’ insomuch as they did not detect other prokaryotic plant pathogens that affect potato except for the putative pathogens associated with psyllid-yellows and haywire. Conventional PCR assays were capable of detecting 0.19 to 1.56 ng of total DNA per reaction, and real-time PCR was found capable of detecting 1.56 to 6.25 ng of total DNA per reaction, depending on the specific PCR primer set used. ‘Ca. Liberibacter’ species associated with zebra complex disease (ZC) was confirmed in plants affected by this disease throughout Texas from 2005 to 2008, in seed tubers produced in Wyoming in 2007, and in Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, and Mexico in 2008. A multiplex PCR assay using ‘Ca. L. solanacearum’–specific primers and primers specific for the β-tubulin DNA regions from potato was developed, providing possible utility of the multiplex assay for ‘Ca. Liberibacter’ detection in different solanaceous plant species. Preliminary studies suggest silverleaf nightshade (Solanum elaeagnifolium), wolfberry (Lycium barbarum), black nightshade (S. ptychanthum), and jalapeno pepper (Capsicum annuum) as additional solanaceous hosts for the ZC-associated bacterium. The ‘Ca. Liberibacter’ species detected in all samples divided into two clusters sharing similarity of 99.8% in their partial 16S rRNA gene sequences and 99.3% in their partial intergenic spacer region (ISR)-23S rRNA gene sequences. Genetic variation in the 16S rDNA region consistently matched that of the ISR-23S rDNA region. In this partial 16S-ISR-23S rDNA region, there was a total of eight single nucleotide polymorphisms among ‘Ca. L. psyllaurous’ and ‘Ca. L. solanacearum’ “strains” investigated in this study. ‘Ca. L. solanacearum’ and ‘Ca. L. psyllaurous’ were shown to be very closely related bacteria, if not the same, by successful amplification using a combination of forward primer of ‘Ca. L. solanacearum’ and reverse primer of ‘Ca. L. psyllaurous’ in ZC-affected potato samples. This finding clarifies the current taxonomic status of ‘Ca. L. solanacearum’ and ‘Ca. L. psyllaurous’. The detection of ‘Ca. L. solanacearum’ from haywire-symptomatic potato samples demonstrates that this bacterium might also be associated with this disease.","https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/pdf/10.1094/PDIS-93-11-1102",""

After empirically accounting for the altered vowel positions, they reported small but consistent increases in F2 transition onsets in emphatically produced CVs that could not be attributed to vowel context influences, and that differed across stop place. At issue is whether the findings of these authors can be replicated, but in the opposite direction, for CVs produced at fast speaking rates. A modified locus equation regression metric was similarly used to account for rate-induced vowel reduction effects in predicting frequencies of F2 transition onsets in rapid speech. Six American-English speakers produced [V1.CV2] sequences embedded in a carrier sentence, at three speaking tempos: normal, fast, and fastest. Significant differences were found between ‘predicted’ and ‘observed’ F2 onsets across stops, with alveolars and velars showing greater decreases in F2 onsets during more rapid speech than labials.

Flows within the fracture, between the fracture and the adjacent matrix, and through the pore space within the matrix typically happen on different length and time scales. Capturing these scales experimentally is difficult. It is, therefore, useful to have a computational tool that establishes the exact position and shape of fluid/fluid interfaces in realistic fracture geometries. The level set method (LSM) is such a tool. Our progressive quasistatic (PQS) algorithm based on the level set method finds detailed, pore-level fluid configurations satisfying the Young-Laplace equation at a series of prescribed capillary pressures. The fluid volumes, contact areas, and interface curvatures are readily extracted from the configurations. The method automatically handles topological changes of the fluid volumes as capillary pressure varies. It also accommodates arbitrarily complicated shapes of confining solid surfaces.","http://onepetro.org/SJ/article-pdf/15/01/125/2104683/spe-116110-pa.pdf",""

SN38 has poor solubility in any pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. The poor solubility of SN38 can be vastly improved by PEGylation. EZN-2208 (PEG-SN38) is a water-soluble, polyethylene glycol (PEG) drug conjugate of SN38 that enables increased solubility, parenteral delivery of SN38, longer circulating half-life, higher exposure of the active drug (SN38) in tumors, and greater preservation of the closed lactone ring (active form) in SN38 compared with SN38 derived from irinotecan. EZN-2208 is active in a broad spectrum of preclinical models of solid tumors and hematologic cancers, including an in vivo tumor model of CPT-11 resistance. EZN-2208 accumulates in tumors, where it releases SN38. EZN-2208 also down-modulates mRNA of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 α (HIF-1α) target genes.","https://aacrjournals.org/mct/article/8/12_Supplement/C221/240965/Abstract-C221-EZN-2208-a-novel-anticancer-agent-in",""

Developing and implementing methods for enhancing tacit knowledge is becoming increasingly important in today’s global business environment; tacit knowledge is an emerging engine of economic growth (Argyris & Schon, 1996; Bergman, Jantunen, & Sakso, 2004; Lahaie, 2005; Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995; Senge, 1990; von Krogh, Ichijo, & Nonaka, 2000). Fortunately, an organization’s HRIS can play a pivotal role in improving tacit knowledge sharing through diagnostic and dissemination methods. But before we can explain how an HRIS can play this role, certain definitions must be made. For this article, we will use a previously developed comprehensive HRIS model that includes all relevant organizational areas relating to HRIS, and describe how each of these areas interact (Mayfield, Mayfield, & Lunce, 2003). As such, it provides an integrated approach to HRIS development and study. More importantly for this article, this model can be used to explicate a blueprint for tacit knowledge enhancement through HRIS techniques, and also provides suggestions for creating specific methods for improving tacit knowledge sharing.

These results were essentially the same as those found more than 20 years ago, indicating a persistent deficiency in fitness education. In addition, little is understood as to how HRF knowledge contributes to the establishment of lifetime physical activity patterns.

A survey of 136 undergraduate students attending a university and 54 illegal hackers attending the DefCon conference in 2003 was conducted. The results show that both groups perceive a higher level of punishment severity but a lower level of informal sanction for hacking than for shoplifting. Our findings show that hackers perceive a lower level of punishment certainty for hacking than for shoplifting, but students perceive a higher level of punishment certainty for hacking than for shoplifting.

As expected, students in the audit condition exhibited significantly higher deliberative moral reasoning than students in the corporate accounting condition. Supplemental analysis indicates this finding is robust to commonly influential demographic characteristics and perceptions about the current business environment.

These measurements were intended to search for a recently predicted antiferromagnetic giant magnetoresistance (AGMR) similar to giant magnetoresistance seen in multilayers containing two ferromagnetic (F) layers separated by a nonmagnetic layer. We report on MR measurements for current injected from point contacts into sandwiches containing different combinations of layers of F=CoFe and AFM=FeMn. In addition to AFM/N/ AFM, F/AFM/N/AFM, and F/AFM/N/AFM/F structures, initial results led us to examine also AFM/F/N/AFM, F/AFM, and single F- and AFM-layer structures. At low currents, no MR was observed in any samples, and no MR was observed at any current densities in samples containing only AFMs. Together, these results indicate that no AGMR is present in these samples. In samples containing F layers, high current densities sometimes produced a small positive MR—largest resistance at high fields. For a given contact resistance, this MR was usually larger for thicker F layers, and for a given current, it was usually larger for larger contact resistances (smaller contacts). We tentatively attribute this positive MR to suppression at high currents of spin accumulation induced around and within the F layers.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.3059615/15588945/07d113_1_online.pdf",""

Although previous studies suggest that commitment ceremonies are a way to form same-sex unions, this study finds that because of their unique social, historical, and biographical relationship to marriage and ceremonies, long-term same-sex couples do not follow normative commitment-making trajectories. Instead, relationships can transition more ambiguously to committed formations without marriage, public ceremony, clear-cut act, or decision.

This chapter explains how these problems can be solved by creating an open source-based shared software infrastructure program (SSIP) sponsored by industry, but planned and implemented by SSIP member universities at no cost to member universities.","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=29463",""

Therefore, it is important to manage the different values of design variables associated with the operating states for each subsystem. The research presented in this paper uses multidisciplinary optimization (MDO) and changeable systems methods together in the design of a reconfigurable Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). MDO is a useful approach for designing a system that is composed of distinct disciplinary subsystems by managing the design variable coupling between the subsystem and system level optimization problems. Changeable design research addresses how changes in the physical configuration of products and systems can better meet distinct needs of different operating states. As a step towards the development of a realistic reconfigurable UAV optimization problem, this paper focuses on the performance advantage of using a changeable airfoil subsystem. Design principles from transformational design methods are used to develop concepts that determine how the design variables are allowed to change in the mathematical optimization problem. The performance of two changeable airfoil concepts is compared to a fixed airfoil design over two different missions that are defined by a sequence of mission segments. Determining the configurations of the static and changeable airfoils is accomplished using a genetic algorithm. Results from this study show that aircraft with changeable airfoils attain increased performance, and that the manner by which the system transforms is significant. For this reason, the changeable airfoil optimization developed in this paper is ready to be integrated into a complete MDO problem for the design of a reconfigurable UAV.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/DETC2009-87482/2776701/57_1.pdf",""

Use of this combination has raised concerns regarding an increased risk of hematologic toxicity. Objective: To evaluate the incidence of leukopenia and neutropenia associated with the use of valproate, quetiapine, or the combination in the child and adolescent population. Methods: This study was a retrospective evaluation of patients from the child and adolescent psychiatric service of the Austin State Hospital who were treated with valproate, quetiapine, or the combination. Subjects were selected from patients discharged between August 1, 2004, and August 31, 2007. Laboratory data were evaluated to determine the incidence and severity of leukopenia and neutropenia associated with valproate, quetiapine, and a combination of the 2. Results: A total of 131 patients were included in the study. Analysis of the laboratory data revealed a combined incidence of neutropenia and/or leukopenia of 44%, 26%, and 6% in the combination group, valproate monotherapy group, and quetiapine monotherapy group, respectively. Differences in the incidence of neutropenia and/or leukopenia between the quetiapine monotherapy group and valproate monotherapy group, as well as the quetiapine monotherapy group and the combination group reached statistical significance. A significant difference was found among groups based on absolute neutrophil count Common Toxicity Criteria severity (p < 0.001). The combination group differed significantly in incidence of moderate-to-severe neutropenia (14 cases) from both the valproate (5 cases) and quetiapine (0 cases) monotherapy groups, A significantly greater number (44%) of African American patients experienced neutropenia and/or leukopenia than white (not Hispanic or Latino; 29%) or Hispanic or Latino (11%) patients. Conclusions: Patients treated with valproate or the combination of valproate and quetiapine should be monitored for the occurrence of leukopenia and neutropenia. Controlled studies are warranted to examine possible pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions with the combination of valproate and quetiapine to further evaluate the hematologic findings of this study.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1345/aph.1L617",""

Eight types of strain previously shown most likely to result in delinquency, including delinquency in the South Korean context, were measured. To better understand how trait- and situational-based negative emotions mediate the connection of strains to delinquency, trait and situational measures were used for anger and depression, emotions commonly expected to promote delinquency. Overall, the findings support GST's key propositions. Most of the eight strains and some interaction terms between strains and conditioning variables had significant effects on various types of delinquency. Furthermore, situational-based negative emotions operated differently than trait-based negative emotions in mediating the relationship between strain and delinquency. These findings raise questions about the assumption that trait-based negative emotions accurately represent situational-based negative emotions in response to strains.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0022427808330873",""

Thus, while textbook techniques treat precisely observed data in multivariate analysis, there are many open research problems when data are censored (e.g., in medical or bio-statistics), missing, or partially observed (e.g., in bioinformatics). Data can be imprecise due to various reasons, for example, due to fuzziness of linguistic data. Imprecise observed data are usually called coarse data. In this chapter, we consider coarse data which are both random and fuzzy. Fuzziness is a form of imprecision often encountered in perception-based information. In order to develop statistical reference procedures based on such data, we need to model random fuzzy data as bona fide random elements, that is, we need to place random fuzzy data completely within the rigorous theory of probability. This chapter presents the most general framework for random fuzzy data, namely the framework of random fuzzy sets. We also describe several applications of this framework.","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=24210",""

Spadefoot toads (genus Spea Cope, 1866) often exhibit a trophic polyphenism by developing distinct carnivore and omnivore larval morphotypes. Using a multimodel selection approach, we investigated the influence of land use (cropland vs. grassland type) and differences in annual precipitation on morphotype expression in Plains spadefoot ( Spea bombifrons (Cope, 1863)) and New Mexico spadefoot ( Spea multiplicata (Cope, 1863)) toads in playas. We also examined the relative importance of tadpole density, tadpole age, water-loss stress, wetland size, density of larval mole salamanders (genus Ambystoma Tschudi, 1838; a predator on Spea tadpoles), and food resources on morph occurrence. The carnivore morphotype developed almost exclusively in S. bombifrons and rarely in S. multiplicata regardless of land use. Habitat availability measured by water-loss rate, as well as predation risk and tadpole age, were the most important factors influencing carnivore proportions. Ambystoma density was positively associated, whereas water-depth loss and tadpole age were negatively associated with the proportion of carnivores. The greatest proportion of carnivores was observed in grassland playas, which had the highest density of Ambystoma predators, longest hydroperiods, and experienced water-depth gain. Fairy shrimp density was not correlated with the proportion of carnivores. Upland land use through cultivation-associated erosion is altering wetland trophic structure, which further influences morphotype expression in Spea tadpoles and playa amphibian community structure.","http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/full-xml/10.1139/Z09-006",""

To address this question, we examined the overall and chromosome-specific telomere lengths of 17p, 12q, 2p, and 11q and assessed their associations with EC risk. In a case-control study with 94 EC cases and 94 matched controls, the overall telomere length and the chromosome-specific telomere lengths of 17p, 12q, 2p, and 11q in peripheral blood lymphocytes were determined by a real-time PCR and a modified single telomere length analysis assay, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between telomere length and EC risk. Compared with controls, EC patients had significantly shorter overall telomere lengths (P = 0.004) and chromosome-specific telomere lengths of 17p (P = 0.003) and 12q (P = 0.006) but not of 11q (P = 0.632) and 2p (P = 0.972). Furthermore, the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the short overall telomere length and chromosome-specific telomere lengths of 17p and 12q were associated with a dose-dependent increase in EC risk. Our study provides the first epidemiologic evidence that short telomere length of 17p and 12q plays an important role in esophageal carcinogenesis, suggesting that short telomere length of specific chromosomes is associated with the etiology of different cancer types.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerpreventionresearch/article-pdf/2/5/459/1732177/459.pdf",""

Subsequent studies revealed a greater degree of homogeneity in the distribution of response properties across stripes, yet color-selective cells were still found to be most prevalent in the thin stripes. Optical recording studies have demonstrated that thin stripes contain both color-preferring and luminance-preferring modules. These thin stripe color-preferring modules contain spatially organized hue maps, whereas the luminance-preferring modules contain spatially organized luminance-change maps. In this study, the neuronal basis of these hue maps was determined by characterizing the selectivity of neurons for isoluminant hues in multiple penetrations within previously characterized V2 thin stripe hue maps. The results indicate that neurons within the superficial layers of V2 thin stripe hue maps are organized into columns whose aggregated hue selectivity is closely related to the hue selectivity of the optically defined hue maps. These data suggest that thin stripes contain hue maps not simply because of their moderate percentage of hue-selective neurons, but because of the columnar and tangential organization of hue selectivity.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jn.91255.2008",""

In particular, this study highlights the predictability limit due to the effects on moist convection of initial-condition errors with amplitudes far smaller than those of any observation or analysis system. Not only can small and arguably unobservable differences in the initial conditions result in different routes to tropical cyclogenesis, but they can also determine whether or not a tropical disturbance will significantly develop. The details of how the initial vortex is built can depend on chaotic interactions of mesoscale features, such as cold pools from moist convection, whose timing and placement may significantly vary with minute initial differences. Inherent uncertainties in hurricane forecasts illustrate the need for developing advanced ensemble prediction systems to provide event-dependent probabilistic forecasts and risk assessment.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jas/article-pdf/66/7/1944/3618078/2009jas2824_1.pdf",""

In particular, it introduces the concept of ‘party non-systems’, defined as those party universes characterized by a fundamental absence of inter-temporal continuity in the identity of the main parties. At the heart of this concept is the explicit differentiation between intra- and extra-systemic volatility. Party non-systems are characterized by persistently high transfers of votes away from the main parties towards new and small parties (i.e. high extra-systemic volatility), an ever-changing constellation of parties without a stable ‘core’. It is argued that the difference between non-systems and all other party universe types is not only one of degree (in level of institutionalization), but also one of kind. This conceptual innovation is then applied to a number of Latin American cases (Guatemala, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia) at the low end of the institutionalization continuum to highlight important cross-country and inter-temporal differences in the nature of (core) party competition.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1354068809334566",""

Due to differences in cultures and values, and government types, it may not be possible to establish global standards and legislations to ensure privacy. Due to the nonexistence of global privacy standards, multinational (international) companies usually select one of the following two possible solutions: (1) implement a most restrictive “one size fits all” privacy policy that is used across various countries, or (2) implement different privacy policies that meet the privacy regulations of different countries and expectations of those citizens. In order to investigate a solution that may be used by multinational companies, and how companies view domestic privacy laws, the authors conducted a survey of U.S.-based employees of domestic and multinational companies. The results of the survey suggest that the majority of the multinational companies prefer the first solution—most restrictive “one size fits all” approach. They develop and implement a single set of privacy policies that is used across their operations in different countries. The majority of the companies surveyed consider domestic privacy laws in the United States to be practical, but ineffective.","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=20613",""

We have determined the effects of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a naturally occurring chemopreventive retinoid, on signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) signaling during the development of skin SCC. Stat3 is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in cell proliferation and survival, and it is constitutively active in several malignant cell types. We have previously shown that Stat3 is required for the initiation, promotion, and progression of skin SCC. ATRA is a highly efficient suppressor of tumor formation in the two-stage mouse skin carcinogenesis model and we have shown that this effect correlates with the suppression of the B-Raf/Mek/Erk signaling pathway. In this study, we have determined the pattern of Stat3 phosphorylation throughout the course of the two-stage protocol, both in the presence and absence of ATRA. We have used both SENCAR mice and K5.Stat3C transgenic mice, which express the Stat3C protein, a constitutively active form of Stat3, in the skin. Using Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining with phosphospecific antibodies, we show that coadministration of ATRA suppressed the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate–induced phosphorylation of Stat3 in both models, but was only able to suppress tumor formation in the SENCAR mice. Surprisingly, ATRA actually enhanced tumor formation in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate–treated K5.Stat3C mice. We hypothesize that ATRA blocks tumor formation, at least in part, by targeting events upstream of Stat3, such as the B-Raf/Mek/Erk pathway, and that in the K5.Stat3C mice, in which Stat3 activity is constitutive, it cannot suppress tumor formation.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerpreventionresearch/article-pdf/2/10/903/1731699/903.pdf",""

The specific local narratives we considered in this study are the “student success stories” told in adult literacy programs, which are distributed to legislators in hopes of influencing policy and funding decisions. We sought to understand the connection between political master narratives and the local narratives of adult literacy education. Research Design: Data consisted of 257 stories published from 1978 through 2005. We used Burke's method of pentadic criticism to examine act, agent, agency, scene, and purpose within the stories. Of special interest was how these elements changed across time, revealing the impact of the dominant political discourse on the telling of those stories. Of particular interest was how actor and agency are portrayed, because political discourse is most visible in the construction of the individual and in how the individual is able to act. Findings: Four of Burke's elements remain constant across both sets of stories—agent, scene, act, and purpose; the only one that changes is agency, or the means used to achieve the act. The agent is the adult literacy learner, and the scene consists of his or her particular life circumstances, which involve hardships of various kinds. The act is the achievement of his or her education goals. The purpose of the act is obtaining a better life, employment, and increased self-esteem. It is in agency, or the means used to achieve the act, that we see a distinct change between the two groups of stories. In the earlier stories, agency is clearly and unambiguously the program. In the later stories, however, agency changes dramatically. The programs recede into the background and often disappear altogether; instead, it is the learners who do the work and who are responsible for their own success. Conclusion: We have shown how adult literacy educators have, in the stories they tell, embraced dominant political ideologies and are currently telling stories focused increasingly on self-sufficiency and the ability of adult literacy learners to “lift themselves up by their bootstraps.” This is a cause for concern because it works to undermine the practice of adult education itself. The challenge to us as a field is not only to understand how dominant discourses speak themselves through us but also, more important, to find ways to subvert them by putting ourselves back into our own narratives of educational practice, thus preserving and serving the interests of adult education.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/016146810911100405",""

Owing to resource scarcities, collaboration is a common form of research for these same individuals. Yet few studies have examined the linkage between graduate education and scientific collaboration. This article examines this question in a population of scientists who have experienced the simultaneous influence of three scientifically strong training systems: Australia, Japan and the US. Survey data from 312 agricultural scientists in two Philippine locations are used to explore the relationships between graduate education, Internet use, professional networks and scientific collaboration. The findings show that most collaboration is domestic, but the most common international collaborations are Japanese, followed by Australian and finally US collaborations. Japanese training, but not professional networks, is associated with such collaborations, while US and Australian training appear unimportant to collaborations in these locations. This the article explains by identifying two aspects integral to graduate education, mode of study and mentoring style , which may be critical to the development of durable professional ties and ultimately to collaborative work. The results show that even among scientific training systems in developed areas, there are variations in interaction and practices that have implications for differential participation in scientific collaboration.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0268580909343501",""

As case law suggests, police engaged in school searches may be held to the probable cause standard or the more flexible reasonable suspicion standard articulated in New Jersey v. T. L. O. (1985). This article examines the use of law enforcement in schools and whether the probability that student offenses are criminalized increases as a result. Data Collection and Analysis: In this study, researchers report data on 2,270 schools from the School Survey on Crime and Safety made available through the National Center for Education Statistics. Using a factorial ANOVA, researchers use various demographic indicators to measure whether schools ordinarily relying on law enforcement for security report offenses to municipal police to a greater degree than those that do not. Findings: Findings indicate that schools using off-duty law enforcement officers report offenses to the police at a significantly higher rate than those not using off-duty law enforcement officers. While poverty, minority composition, and urbanicity do not interact significantly with off-duty police use, the minority composition of the school and the percentage of students receiving free and reduced-price lunch, when examined as main effects, yield statistically significant differences in the mean percentage of offenses reported to the police. These findings suggest the need for schools to develop clearly articulated policies with respect to police intervention, as well as the need for further research into decision making of principals in schools with greater concentrations of student poverty.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0013161X09335545",""

Reporting likelihood was significantly lower under a disclosed identity format, while there was no significant difference in likelihood between anonymous and protected identity formats. Contrasts reveal a significantly higher likelihood of reporting audit standards violations than a professional code violation. Likelihood was also positively related to measures of trust that the firm would investigate and act on the reported incident.

Second, we consider prior research on how financial statement (“generalist”) auditors acquire and use IS knowledge. Third, we discuss research on the interaction between generalist and IS auditors. Each section concludes with suggestions for future research.","https://publications.aaahq.org/jis/article-pdf/23/1/79/10720/jis_2009_23_1_79.pdf",""

We propose that innovation narratives are cultural mechanisms that address these coordination requirements by enabling translation. Specifically, innovation narratives are powerful mechanisms for translating ideas across the organization so that they are comprehensible and appear legitimate to others. Narratives also enable people to translate emergent situations that are ambiguous or equivocal so as to promote real-time problem solving. With their accumulation, innovation narratives provide a generative memory for organizations that enable people to translate ideas accumulated from particular instances of past innovation to inform current and future efforts.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/orsc.1080.0372",""

Typical deepwater completions contain additional layers of sand screen, gravel sand, and perforated casing, which make them quite different from a fluid-filled open borehole. Monitoring changes in flow properties across the completion is crucial because impairment of permeability in any of these layers could cause reduced well productivity. In contrast to an open-hole model, a sand-screened completion supports two tube waves related to an inner fluid column and a gravel suspension in the annulus. To study effects of screen and sand permeability on tube-wave signatures, we construct simple numerical models of various completion scenarios using poroelastic descriptions of screen and sand. Models generally predict that a fast tube wave does not attenuate at either low or high permeability, but experiences resonant attenuation at intermediate frequencies. In contrast, a slow tube wave attenuates completely above a certain permeability value. Models provide a qualitative and sometimes a semiquantitative description for signatures of the fast tube wave. However, they are unable to explain why the slow tube wave is observed in experiments with high permeabilities of sand and screen. We speculate that a better model of complex sand screens is required to match experimental data.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/1.3002769",""

We quantified capillary forces between different particles (sphere, cylinder, cube, disk, sheet, and natural mineral particles) and a moving air‐water interface. The particles had different sizes and contact angles (ranging from 14° to 121°). Theoretical calculations using the Young‐Laplace equation were used to support and generalize the experimental data. When the air‐water interface moved over the particles, there were strong capillary forces acting on the particles in the direction of the moving interface. The measured maximum capillary forces were similar to those calculated by the Young‐Laplace equation. The larger the contact angles and the larger the particle size, the stronger were the capillary forces. Particles with irregular shape and sharp edges experienced greater forces than smooth particles. Generalization of the results indicates that capillary forces exerted by a moving air‐water interface can readily exceed attractive Derjaguin‐Landau‐Verwey‐Overbeek (DLVO) and gravity forces for typical subsurface particles, and a moving air‐water interface is therefore an effective mechanism for mobilization of particles in porous media.

As the level of integration occurs, automotive electronics are going to be challenged by software development and integration. As a result, it is going to increase overall product development time and cost. While it has been a growing concern for both academician and practitioners, the prior literature is still very limited in terms providing a clear or sufficiently structured framework to address the issues of global product development system. This chapter attempts to narrow down this gap by presenting a lean and global product development (GPD) framework and the necessary enablers to achieve this end. The framework is demonstrated through an automotive industry case study.","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=21650",""

This paper presents results from a computational study investigating a three-dimensional slot geometry at the combustor-turbine interface. The downstream edge of the slot was scalloped using a simple periodic function intended to enhance thermal benefit to the endwall by manipulating coolant distribution. Effects of varying the slot geometry amplitude and phase were investigated along with the slot nominal width and upstream distance from the vane.

This reduction in strength has generally been attributed to Residual Oxide Defect (ROD). From NASA experience it was also found that certain processing parameters would yield these reduced mechanical properties. The strength of FSW Aluminum panels generally decreases with increasing tool travel rate, decreasing rotation speed, and offset of the weld seam to the retreating side of the FSW tool. The microstructure of welds exhibiting these strength reduction as well as welds that behaved as expected were examined to determine microstructural effects of processing parameters. Therefore the evolutions of microstructural properties are immensely important to understand and evaluate to avoid any catastrophic failures due to the defects arising from welding operations. Scanning Electron Microscopy shows that these weld conditions are accompanied by large precipitates along the grain boundary for both AA-2219 and AA-2195 FSW welded samples. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) also shows the precipitates to be “theta particles (Al2Cu)” and intermetallics in the AA-2219; and T1 (Al2CuLi), and TB particles in the AA-2195. The large size and heavy distributions of these precipitates, especially on the advancing side of the weld seam may influence these properties. It is determined that the existence of ROD in the samples must be analyzed systematically and carefully through the evolutions of microstructures, if catastrophic failures are to be avoided during service conditions. A more complete understanding of this phenomenon is necessary to ensure consistent and predictable weld properties thereby reducing or eliminating the risk of unforeseen failures.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2009-13086/2754145/161_1.pdf",""

Research has shown that good hip range of motion and strength in throwing athletes results in greater performance and decreased stress placed on the upper extremity. Although research has investigated bilateral differences in hip characteristics among baseball pitchers, little is known about differences between pitchers and position players. Hypothesis: Pitchers will have decreased passive hip rotation range of motion and gluteus medius strength compared with position players. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Forty professional baseball pitchers and 40 position players with no recent history of lower extremity injury participated. Bilateral hip external and internal rotation range of motion, total arc of motion, and gluteus medius strength were measured with a digital inclinometer and handheld dynamometer. Results: A Hotelling T2 multivariate analysis of variance showed position players to have significantly more hip internal rotation range of motion (3.1°, P = .01, effect size = .53) and abduction strength (3.5 kg, P =.04, effect size = .53) in the trail leg compared with the pitchers. There were no significant differences for any other hip characteristics between groups (P > .07). Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that baseball pitchers have significantly smaller amounts of hip internal rotation range of motion and abduction strength of the trail leg compared with position players. However, these differences may not be clinically significant. Clinical Relevance: Position players may be able to develop more energy in the lower extremity, while pitchers may rely more on energy created in the core and upper extremity, potentially placing pitchers at an increased risk for upper extremity injury. These descriptive hip characteristics may help clinicians detect inadequacies and provide appropriate prevention, diagnostic, and treatment interventions for such athletes.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0363546509347365",""

We compare several small channels that share tributary junctions and have incised into the same sedimentary bedrock unit (Navajo Sandstone) but contain differing amounts of coarse diorite clasts owing to the spatial distribution of localized sediment sources. Bedrock channels that contain abundant clasts (diorite‐rich) have steeper longitudinal slopes than tributaries of these channels with smaller drainage areas and less sediment (diorite‐poor). The diorite‐poor tributaries have incised more deeply to lower average slopes and have more reach‐scale slope variability, which may reflect bedrock properties, longitudinal sediment sorting, and incision at lower sediment supply. Diorite‐rich channels have less bedrock exposed and smoother longitudinal profiles than diorite‐poor channels. We find that (1) coarse sediment can mantle bedrock channel beds and reduce the efficiency of incision, validating the hypothesized cover effect in fluvial incision models; (2) the channel slope needed to transport the sediment load can be larger than that needed to erode bedrock, suggesting that the slope of incising bedrock channels can become adjusted to the sediment load; (3) when abundant sediment is available, transport capacity rather than thresholds of motion can be dominant in setting bedrock channel slope; and (4) cover effects can be important even when moderate amounts of bedrock are exposed in channel beds.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2007JF000862",""

NIDSs rely on an underlying string matching engine that simulates PCREs to inspect each network packet. PCRE is a superset of traditional regular expressions, and provides advanced features. However, this pattern matching becomes a performance bottleneck of software-based NIDSs, causing a big portion of their execution time to be dedicated to payload inspection, which results in an unacceptable packet drop rate. The penetration of these unexamined packets creates a security hole in such systems. Over the past decade, hardware acceleration for the pattern matching has been studied extensively and a marginal performance has been achieved. Among hardware approaches, FPGA-based acceleration engines provide great flexibility because new signatures can be compiled and programmed into their reconfigurable architecture. As more and more malicious signatures are discovered, it becomes harder to map a complete set of malicious signatures specified in PCREs to an FPGA chip. One of the space consuming components is the counter used in the constrained repetitions for PCREs. Therefore, we propose a space efficient SelectRAM counter for PCREs that use counting. The design takes advantage of the basic components contained in a configurable logic block, and thus optimizes space usage. A set of basic PCRE blocks has been built in hardware to implement PCREs. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing designs by at least fivefold.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1575779.1575783",""

We formulate the security-aware resource optimization problem as an optimization problem under the SLA constraints, and solve it using an efficient numerical procedure.

Recent studies showed the (limited) effects of age and gender on sensory gating in control subjects, suggesting there may be other sources of variance. Two potential sources may be education and intelligence (intellectual capability), variables that frequently differ across studies and across experimental groups. We explored potential effects of age, gender, education, and intelligence (Shipley intelligence scale) on P50, N100, and P200 sensory gating measured with the paired-click paradigm in 60 healthy subjects recruited from the general population. Increased intellectual capability related to stronger N100 and P200 gating and more pronounced N100 and P200 amplitudes. In addition, increased age related to weaker P200 gating and smaller P200 amplitudes. Gender had negligible effects. Intellectual capability or age could contribute to variation in N100 or P200 auditory sensory gating and should be controlled for when studying sensory gating in clinical and control groups.","https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/pdf/10.1027/0269-8803.23.2.52",""

Two types of initially balanced and localized jets induced by vortex dipoles are examined here. These jets have their maximum strength either at the surface or in the middle levels of a uniformly stratified atmosphere. Within these dipoles, inertia–gravity waves with intrinsic frequencies 1–2 times the Coriolis parameter are simulated in the jet exit region. These gravity waves are nearly phase locked with the jets as shown in previous studies, suggesting spontaneous emission of the waves by the localized jets. A ray tracing technique is further employed to investigate the propagation effects of gravity waves. The ray tracing analysis reveals strong variation of wave characteristics along ray paths due to variations (particularly horizontal variations) in the propagating environment.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jas/article-pdf/66/5/1294/3510540/2008jas2830_1.pdf",""

Ground turkey thigh (5.09% fat, pH 6.45), turkey breast (0.47% fat, pH 6.04) and pork (17.04% fat, pH 6.36) were inoculated with an 8 strain Salmonella cocktail. The meat was cooked isothermally at 50, 54, 58, 62 and 66ºC, and non-isothermally at two heating rates (5 or 10 ºC/min) to 54, 60 and 66 ºC. Surviving Salmonella were enumerated at intervals during the cooking process. Isothermal survival curves were described by the Weibull distribution, log S (t) = -b (T) tn(T), and its simplified form as a linear equation (n=1). Nonlinearity was observed in Salmonella survival curves. The Weibull distribution described pathogen inactivation better than its simplified linear form for all isothermal trials. The b and n parameters from isothermal data were used to predict the non-isothermal survival curves. Piecewise cubic hermite interpolating polynomial was used to estimate b and n in the non-isothermal program. At 54 and 66 ºC, the Weibull model well predicted the non-isothermal Salmonella survival curves for all meats. The model over-predicted the destruction of Salmonella in three meats at 60 ºC for both heating rates. The accurate prediction of Salmonella destruction at 66 ºC was at a higher temperature than the range of validity reported in the literature.","http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/ijfe.2009.5.2/ijfe.2009.5.2.1642/ijfe.2009.5.2.1642.xml",""

We extend concepts from module-based product family design to create a method for designing families of services. In particular, we introduce a strategic platform design method for developing customized families of services using game theory to model situations involving dynamic market environments. A module-based service model is proposed to facilitate customized service design and represent the relationships between functions and processes that constitute a service offering. A module selection problem for platform design is considered as a strategic module sharing problem under collaboration, and we use a coalitional game to model module sharing and decide which modules provide more benefit when in the platform based on marginal contribution of each module. To demonstrate implementation of the proposed method, we use a case study involving a family of banking services.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/DETC2009-87280/2776385/1019_1.pdf",""

Each vehicle attempts to maintain a specified constant safe distance from its adjacent vehicles in the collection. We consider an identical structure for each decentralized controller so that it is simpler from an implementation viewpoint as it does not depend on collection size or vehicle indices. We call a vehicle B adjacent to vehicle A if the relative position of vehicle B is known to vehicle A either by communication or by sensing. In this paper, we only consider undirected information flow graphs, i.e., graphs where vehicle A is adjacent to vehicle B if and only if vehicle B is adjacent to vehicle A. We consider a point mass model for each vehicle and assume the actuation transfer function, which relates the control input to the force supplied to the vehicle, to be a strictly proper rational transfer function. It is known that spacing errors due to disturbances amplify if the reference vehicle information is not available to Ω(n) vehicles, n being the size of the collection [1]. In this paper, we generalize this result to show the following: If there are two or more vehicles in the collection that are adjacent to Ω(n) vehicles, then there is a critical size N* so that the motion of the collection will be unstable if the size of the collection exceeds N*. Practical issues of fault tolerance indicate that there be at least two vehicles that are adjacent to Ω(n) vehicles in the collection. We also further show that the use of a kinematic vehicle model for analysis of disturbance propagation yields results which may not agree with what is observed in practice and hence are inappropriate.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/DSCC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/DSCC2009-2767/2770657/731_1.pdf",""

For this purpose, the effects of a legume-enriched, low glycemic index, high fermentable fiber diet was evaluated in subjects with four possible combinations of risk factors, including insulin resistance and a history of adenomatous polyps. In a randomized crossover design controlled feeding study, each participant (a total of 23; 5–12 per group) consumed the experimental diet (1.5 cups of cooked dry beans) and a control diet (isocaloric average American diet) for 4 weeks with a 3-week washout period between diets. Using prior biological knowledge, the complexity of feature selection was reduced to perform an exhaustive search on all allowable feature (gene) sets of size 3, and among these, 27 had (unbiased) error estimates of 0.15 or less. Linear discriminant analysis was successfully used to identify the best single genes and two- to three-gene combinations for distinguishing subjects with insulin resistance, a history of polyps, or exposure to a chemoprotective legume-rich diet.

Sixteen newborn pigs were nursed by sows for 24 h and then assigned to 4 treatment groups, representing supplementation with chol (0.0 or 0.2%), and DHA (0.0 or 0.2%) to the basal formula mainly consisting of coconut oil, soybean oil, soybean flour, whey, and whey protein. Pigs were housed individually and fed ad libitum for 7 wk. Body weight and food intake were measured weekly. At age 21, the pigs were exposed to the Morris water maze test. All piglets were euthanized at d 49 to obtain cerebrum for determining fatty acid composition. During the 7 wk period, weight gain and food intake did not differ among treatments. Pigs without chol and DHA required longer (P < 0.01) time to complete the water maze than pigs in other treatments. Cerebrum of pigs with both chol and DHA had greater (P < 0.05) omega‐3 to 6‐fatty acid ratios than pigs in other treatments. Weight of cerebrum did not differ among treatments.

Across two studies, the authors demonstrate that consumers with lower health consciousness are particularly sensitive to conflicting information about the validity of a functional food health claim; specifically, the presentation of conflicting (versus complementary) information significantly lowers their likelihood of choosing a functional over a nonfunctional food. In contrast, consumers with higher health consciousness do not reduce their likelihood of choosing a functional food when confronted with conflicting information. The authors demonstrate that this effect is driven by a confirmatory bias to believe the functional food health claim on the part of more health conscious consumers.

The purpose of this study is to implement a methodology based on number of out-of-state licenses to gauge the demand for licensing among NDs in unlicensed states and to identify likely candidates for successful legislative efforts regarding licensure. Methods: Counts of out-of-state ND licenses issued through Arizona, Connecticut, Oregon, and Washington, the four states with naturopathic medical schools, were used as a surrogate for interest in licensing among states not offering licensing of NDs. Results: In 2005, a total of 457 U.S. NDs obtained out-of-state licenses from the states of Washington (159), Oregon (159), Arizona (79), and Connecticut (60), with 59% of these out-of-state NDs applying from nonlicensed states. States with low (1—13) or moderate (18—27) numbers of out-of-state licensures constituted 69% of the NDs, while the remaining 31% of NDs who fell into the high (43—58) out-of-state licensure category were from only three states: California, Colorado, and New York. Discussion: Of the three states with high out-of-state licensure, California has recently passed licensure legislation. Previous studies have indicated that New York and Colorado scored high on legislative innovativeness. Should licensing of NDs be passed in these two states, the possibility exists that legislation would spread to adjacent and other proximal states.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1533210109337002",""

On average, lake-effect lightning occurred on 7.9 days and with 5.8 storm events during a particular cool season (September–March). The CG lightning with these storms had little inland extent and was usually limited to a few flashes per storm. Some storms had considerably more, with the most intense storm (based on National Lightning Detection Network observations) producing 1551 CG flashes over a 4-day period. Thundersnow events were examined in more detail because of the rarity of this phenomenon across the United States. Most lake-effect thundersnow events (75%) occurred in November and December. An analysis of model sounding data using the Buffalo Toolkit for Lake Effect Snow (BUFKIT) software package in which lower boundary conditions can be modified by lake surfaces showed that thundersnow events had an 82% increase in the mean height of the −10°C level when compared with nonelectrified lake-effect snowstorms (1.2 vs 0.7 km AGL), had higher lake-induced equilibrium levels (EL; above 3.6 km AGL) and convective available potential energy (CAPE; &gt;500 J kg−1), had low wind shear environments, and were intense, single-band storms.

The d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)/Ca2+/protein kinase C (PKC)/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway regulates cholangiocarcinoma growth. We evaluated the role of HRH3 in the regulation of cholangiocarcinoma growth. Expression of HRH3 in intrahepatic and extrahepatic cell lines, normal cholangiocytes, and human tissue arrays was measured. In Mz-ChA-1 cells stimulated with (R)-(α)-(−)-methylhistamine dihydrobromide (RAMH), we measured (a) cell growth, (b) IP3 and cyclic AMP levels, and (c) phosphorylation of PKC and mitogen-activated protein kinase isoforms. Localization of PKCα was visualized by immunofluorescence in cell smears and immunoblotting for PKCα in cytosol and membrane fractions. Following knockdown of PKCα, Mz-ChA-1 cells were stimulated with RAMH before evaluating cell growth and extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 phosphorylation. In vivo experiments were done in BALB/c nude mice. Mice were treated with saline or RAMH for 44 days and tumor volume was measured. Tumors were excised and evaluated for proliferation, apoptosis, and expression of PKCα, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, VEGF-C, VEGF receptor 2, and VEGF receptor 3. HRH3 expression was found in all cells. RAMH inhibited the growth of cholangiocarcinoma cells. RAMH increased IP3 levels and PKCα phosphorylation and decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation. RAMH induced a shift in the localization of PKCα expression from the cytosolic domain into the membrane region of Mz-ChA-1 cells. Silencing of PKCα prevented RAMH inhibition of Mz-ChA-1 cell growth and ablated RAMH effects on ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In vivo, RAMH decreased tumor growth and expression of VEGF and its receptors; PKCα expression was increased. RAMH inhibits cholangiocarcinoma growth by PKCα-dependent ERK1/2 dephosphorylation. Modulation of PKCα by histamine receptors may be important in regulating cholangiocarcinoma growth.

Spectra are reported over the photon energy range of 21≤hν≤55 eV. Vibrational branching ratios for all of the normal modes are determined and the results exhibit mode-specific deviations from Franck–Condon behavior. Schwinger variational calculations indicate the presence of four shape resonances, two kσ resonances and two kπ resonances. All of the resonances play a role in the observed vibrationally resolved behavior. Two results are striking; first, the resonances are more sensitive to the C–O stretch than to the C–S stretch, particularly for photon energies above 30 eV. This relative insensitivity of the resonance to geometry changes involving a third-row element is similar to other systems studied. Second, theoretical results lead to the counterintuitive conclusion that bending the molecule suppresses the high energy resonance, even though there is an enhancement in the vibrational branching ratio curve for the single quantum bending excitation. The agreement between the theoretical and experimental branching ratio curves is good. Finally, the results unambiguously demonstrate that the forbidden bending excitation is caused by photoelectron-mediated vibronic coupling, i.e., the variation in the electronic transition matrix element with geometry, rather than the traditional explanation of interchannel vibronic coupling with intensity borrowing between ionic states.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.3062806/15421736/044302_1_online.pdf",""

As the design progresses, additional information is externally added or internally generated within the design process. As a result, the design solution becomes increasingly well-defined and the uncertainty of the problem reduces, diminishing to zero at the end of the process when the design is fully defined. In this research a measure of uncertainty is proposed for a class of engineering design problems called discrete design problems. Previously, three components of complexity in engineering design, namely, size, coupling and solvability, were identified. In this research uncertainty is measured in terms of the number of design variables (size) and the dependency between the variables (coupling). The solvability of each variable is assumed to be uniform for the sake of simplicity. The dependency between two variables is measured as the effect of a decision made on one variable on the solution options available to the other variable. A measure of uncertainty is developed based on this premise, and applied to an example problem to monitor uncertainty reduction through the design process. Results are used to identify and compare three task-sequencing strategies in engineering design.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/DETC2009-87600/2776807/337_1.pdf",""

Differences in thermal tolerances between species result in their differential geographic locations and overwintering ranges. Displacements among Liriomyza species are associated with their temperature adaptation. We examine the chemical linkage of plants, Liriomyza, and their parasitoids. Chemical compounds from host and nonhost plants mediate the behavior of Liriomyza and their parasitoids. Liriomyza and their parasitoids use chemical cues to locate their hosts. Induced compounds can be used as attractants of parasitoids or repellents of Liriomyza.

Three approaches are tested: (i) updating specific humidity with observations other than specific humidity (“passive q”), (ii) updating specific humidity only with humidity observations (“univariate q”), and (iii) assimilating the humidity and the other observations together (“multivariate q”). This is the first time that the performance of the univariate and multivariate assimilation of q is compared within an ensemble Kalman filter framework. The results show that updating the humidity analyses by either AIRS specific humidity retrievals or nonhumidity observations improves both the humidity and wind analyses. The improvement with the multivariate-q experiment is by far the largest for all dynamical variables at both analysis and forecast time, indicating that the interaction between the specific humidity and the other dynamical variables through the background error covariance during data assimilation process yields more balanced analysis fields. In the univariate assimilation of q, the humidity interacts with the other dynamical variables only through the forecast process. The univariate assimilation produces more accurate humidity analyses than those obtained when no humidity observations are assimilated, but it does not improve the accuracy of the zonal wind analyses. The 6-h total column precipitable water forecast also benefits from the improved humidity analyses, with the multivariate q experiment having the largest improvement.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/mwr/article-pdf/137/11/3918/4241764/2009mwr2791_1.pdf",""

Sixty-two schools with 201 kindergarten classrooms and 3,635 students in a southwestern state were randomly assigned to administer kindergarten assessment in the fall or in the winter, with teachers receiving onsite or web mentoring. A small, significant effect ( d = 0.13) was found for outcomes on a standardized reading test administered at the end of kindergarten when teachers administered the screen in the fall and received web rather than onsite mentoring. A slight, nonsignificant, reduction in reading risk (i.e., reduction in false positives) was apparent.

Computational and experimental data are compared for the excitation of two totally symmetric modes. Resonant features at photon energies near 19 and 21 eV are found. A detailed analysis of the computed results shows that the two resonance states have different responses to changes in the C–C and C–F bond lengths. We find that the energies of both of the resonant states decrease with increasing bond lengths. In contrast to the energy positions, however, the resonant widths and the integrated oscillator strength of the resonances can either increase or decrease with increasing bond length depending on the nature and location of the resonant state and the location of the bond under consideration. With increasing C–F bond length, we find that the energy of the antibonding σ resonance localized on the ring has a decreasing resonance energy and also a decreasing lifetime. This behavior is in contrast to the usual behavior of shape resonance energies where increasing a bond length leads to decreasing resonance energies and increasing resonance lifetimes. Finally, for the first time, we examine the effect of simultaneously occurring multiple vibrations on the resonance profile for valence photoionization, and we find that the inclusion of more than a single vibrational mode substantially attenuates the strength of resonance.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.3180817/15633705/044311_1_online.pdf",""

Multiple tumor microenvironment factors, such as epidermal and hepatocyte growth factors, in concert with αvβ5 integrin ligation, induce Mig-7 mRNA expression. Gain or loss of Mig-7 protein studies shows that Mig-7 promotes invasion of colon and endometrial carcinoma cells. These data led us to hypothesize that targeting Mig-7 through various methods could decrease invasion, enhance monocyte cell killing of tumor cells, and inhibit disease progression. To begin testing this hypothesis, an in vitro chemoinvasion assay of endometrial carcinoma cells treated with Mig-7–specific or control antibodies was used. Mig-7 antibody significantly reduced invasion by &gt;60% compared with controls. In another approach to test this hypothesis, an in vitro analysis of peptide-stimulated human peripheral blood monocyte cells and their killing of MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells was used. Mig-7 peptide treatment increased monocyte cell tumor necrosis factor expression and killing of MCF-7 cells 30-fold over no peptide stimulation and 3-fold over MUC-1 or control peptide treatments. Furthermore, stably expressing Mig-7–specific short hairpin RNA resulted in significantly reduced Mig-7 protein levels and early primary tumor growth in a xenograft nude mouse model. Reduced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, Akt, and S6 kinase as well as decreased membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase activity were mechanisms through which Mig-7 protein caused these effects. Based on these collective data, Mig-7 expression could be a potential candidate for future targeted cancer therapies.

The data, excluding children with Down syndrome or who died before 28 days of life, included 17,672 cases diagnosed from 1980 to 2004 at ages 28 days to 14 years and 57,966 controls with all cases and controls born from 1970 to 2004. Analyses were restricted to children weighing ≤4,000 g at birth. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression adjusting for sex, gestational age, birth weight, birth order, maternal age, maternal race, state of birth, and birth year. Children who were multiples had no difference in risk of cancer overall (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.82-1.07), but a borderline reduced risk of Wilms' tumor (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.39-1.09). For children diagnosed &lt;2 y of age there was a reduced risk of Wilms' tumor (OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.09-0.86) and neuroblastoma (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.25-0.84) and an increased risk of fibrosarcoma (OR, 5.81; 95% CI, 1.53-22.11). Higher-order multiple birth (triplets or higher) was not associated with childhood cancer.

This article seeks to address this issue by reevaluating those subject areas and competencies that have long been considered the core of public sector HRM education, proposing what new competencies should be introduced into the core in light of the contemporary reform environment and providing a preliminary assessment of the extent to which contemporary academic and practitioner-based educational programs reflect the current landscape of public sector HRM.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0734371X09351828",""

At low particle concentrations, these systems behave like simple atomic mixtures. However, for intermediate concentrations, the single-particle dynamics of the two species largely decouple, giving rise to the following anomalous trends. Increasing either the concentration of the fluid (at fixed composition) or the mole fraction of the larger particles (at fixed particle concentration) enhances the tracer diffusivity of the larger particles but decreases that of the smaller particles. In fact, at sufficiently high particle concentrations, the larger particles exhibit higher mobility than the smaller particles. Each of these dynamic behaviors is accompanied by a corresponding structural trend that characterizes how either concentration or composition affects the strength of the static pair correlations. Specifically, the dynamic trends observed here are consistent with a single empirical scaling law that relates an appropriately normalized tracer diffusivity to its pair-correlation contribution to the excess entropy.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.3256235/13578877/161101_1_online.pdf",""

Contrary to most observations in sandstones, bulk compressibility losses dominate over shear wave losses for dry samples and samples fully saturated with either liquid butane or brine. This observation holds for four out of five samples at seismic (10–1000 Hz) and ultrasonic frequencies (0.8 MHz) and reservoir pressures. Attenuation modeled from the modulus data using Cole‐Cole relations agrees in that the bulk losses are greater than the shear losses. On average, attenuation increases by 250% when brine substitutes a light hydrocarbon in these carbonate rocks. For some of our samples, attenuation is frequency‐dependent, but in the typical exploration frequency range (10–100 Hz), attenuation is practically constant for the measured samples.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2008JB005890",""

A protein is a sequence of amino acid residues and can thus be considered as a one dimensional chain of ‘beads’ where each bead correspond to one of the 20 different amino acid residues known to occur in proteins. The length of most protein sequence ranges from 50 residues to about 1000 residues but longer proteins are also known, e.g. myosin, the major protein of muscle fibers, consists of 1800 residues (Altschul et al. 1997). Many techniques were used many researchers to predict the protein secondary structure, but the most commonly used technique for protein secondary structure prediction is the neural network (Qian et al. 1988). This chapter discusses a new method combining profile-based neural networks (Rost et al. 1993b), Simulated Annealing (SA) (Akkaladevi et al. 2005; Simons et al. 1997), Genetic algorithm (GA) (Akkaladevi et al. 2005) and the decision fusion algorithms (Akkaladevi et al. 2005). Researchers used the neural network (Hopfield 1982) combined with GA and SA algorithms, and then applied the two decision fusion methods; committee method and the correlation methods and obtained improved results on the prediction accuracy (Akkaladevi et al. 2005). Sequence profiles of amino acids are fed as input to the profile-based neural network. The two decision fusion methods improved the prediction accuracy, but noticeably one method worked better in some cases and the other method for some other sequence profiles of amino acids as input (Akkaladevi et al. 2005). Instead of compromising on some of the good solutions that could have generated from either approach, a combination of these two approaches is used for obtaining better prediction accuracy. This criterion is the basis for the Bayesian inference method (Anandalingam et al. 1989; Schmidler et al. 2000; Simons et al. 1997). The results obtained show that the prediction accuracy improves by more than 2% using the combination of the decision fusion approach and the Bayesian inference method.","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=10412",""

Findings are consistent with a view that the Dark Triad facilitates an exploitative, short‐term mating strategy in men.

This course uses the constructivist approach, where instructors engage students by organizing information around concept-based problems. To this end, a semester-long, inquiry-based project was introduced where students studied lichen populations on trees located on their campus to monitor air quality. Data were incorporated into a geographical information systems (GIS) database to demonstrate how it can be used to map communities. Student teams counted the number of each lichen type within a grid placed on each tree trunk sampled and entered this information into a GIS database. The students constructed maps of lichen populations at each sample site and wrote abstracts about their research. Student performance was assessed by the preparation of these abstracts as well as by scores on pre- and posttests of key content measures. Students also completed a survey to determine whether the project aided in their comprehension as well as their interest in incorporating this activity into their own curricula. The students’ pre- and posttest results showed an eightfold improvement in the total score after the semester project. Additionally, correct responses to each individual content measure increased by at least 35%. Total scores for the abstract ranged from 12 to 20 points out of 20 total points possible (60% to 100%), with a mean score of 15.8 points (78%).

A systematic approach to controlling the internal stress of the nickel deposits, which was essential for predicting the final flatness of the LAMIs prior to electroplating, was carried out. The internal stress of the nickel deposits from a nickel sulfamate solution was estimated using a bent strip stress measurement method after maintaining electroplating chemicals and conditions and reducing contamination. Over-electroplating of the nickel LAMIs was performed on SU-8 electroplating molds on 150 mm diameter Si wafers. Detailed characterization of the nickel LAMIs to determine the relationship between the overall flatness of the LAMIs and the internal stress identified a suitable process window in terms of the current densities (10–20 mA/cm2) and the internal stress (−8.3 ∼ −3.0 MPa) for the high quality nickel LAMIs with an overall flatness of 100 μm.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2009-11639/4589499/263_1.pdf",""

To enhance the response rate and decrease myelosuppression, the dose of oxaliplatin was increased to 30mg daily, the dose of Ara-C was decreased to 0.5g/m2 daily and the optimal number of days of fluradabine and Ara-C administration was explored (OFAR2). Methods: In a Phase I-II study of OFAR2, patients were treated with oxaliplatin 30mg/m2, D1-4; fludarabine 30mg/m2, Ara-C 0.5g/m2; rituximab 375mg/m2, D3; and pelfigrastim 6mg, D6. Fludarabine and Ara-C were given on D2-3 (dose level 1) D2-4 (dose level 2) or D2-5 (dose level 3); courses were repeated every 4 weeks. Patients received prophylaxis for tumor lysis, DNA viruses, and PCP. A “3+3” design was used and the planned number of patients in the Phase II was 90 (CLL, 60; RS, 30). Results: Ninety-one patients (CLL, 67; RS, 24) have been treated to date: Phase I, 12 patients (by dose level: 1, n=3; 2, n=6; and 3, n=3). DLTs were noted in 2 of 3 patients on dose level 3 (G4 diarrhea, 1; G4 neutropenic sepsis, 1); thus, dose level 2 was the MTD. Seventy-nine patients (relapsed CLL, 58; RS, 19) have been treated in the Phase II portion of the study. Patient characteristics were as follows: age > 60 years, 65%; 17p deletion, 38%; 11q deletion, 13%; 13q deletion, 16%; trisomy 12, 21%; no findings, 12%; unmutated IgVH, 80%; ZAP70-positive, 75%; and CD38 ≥30%, 58%. Response in patients treated in the Phase II recommended dose is shown in Table (evaluable, 67). Conclusion: Preliminary results demonstrated that OFAR2 induced response in 40% of patients with RS and 63% of patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. OFAR2 had antileukemic activity in patients with 17p deletion. Clinical outcomes appeared to be superior to those of OFAR1 in refractory CLL, whereas results of OFAR1 appeared to be superior to those of OFAR2 in RS. Accrual is ongoing.

In general, an intelligent system is able to sense and respond to the changing environment; gather and store information in its memory; learn from earlier experiences; adapt its behaviors to meet new challenges; and achieve its pre-determined or evolving objectives. The system may start with a set of predefined stimulusresponse rules. Those rules may be revised and improved through learning. Anytime the system encounters a situation, it evaluates and selects the most appropriate rules from its memory to act upon. Most human organizations such as nations, governments, universities, and business firms, can be considered as intelligent systems. In recent years, researchers have developed frameworks for building organizations around intelligence, as opposed to traditional approaches that focus on products, processes, or functions (e.g., Liang, 2002; Gupta and Sharma, 2004). Today’s organizations must go beyond traditional goals of efficiency and effectiveness; they need to have organizational intelligence in order to adapt and survive in a continuously changing environment (Liebowitz, 1999). The intelligent behaviors of those organizations include monitoring of operations, listening and responding to stakeholders, watching the markets, gathering and analyzing data, creating and disseminating knowledge, learning, and effective decision making. Modeling intelligent systems has been a challenge for researchers. Intelligent systems, in particular, those involve multiple intelligent players, are complex systems where system dynamics does not follow clearly defined rules. Traditional system dynamics approaches or statistical modeling approaches rely on rather restrictive assumptions such as homogeneity of individuals in the system. Many complex systems have components or units which are also complex systems. This fact has significantly increased the difficulty of modeling intelligent systems. Agent-based modeling of complex systems such as ecological systems, stock market, and disaster recovery has recently garnered significant research interest from a wide spectrum of fields from politics, economics, sociology, mathematics, computer science, management, to information systems. Agent-based modeling is well suited for intelligent systems research as it offers a platform to study systems behavior based on individual actions and interactions. In the following, we present the concepts and illustrate how intelligent agents can be used in modeling intelligent systems. We start with basic concepts of intelligent agents. Then we define agent-based modeling (ABM) and discuss strengths and weaknesses of ABM. The next section applies ABM to intelligent system modeling. We use an example of technology diffusion for illustration. Research issues and directions are discussed next, followed by conclusions.","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=10225",""

Theories of performance frontiers and capability progression provide the basis for our hypotheses. Data were collected from 224 U.S. manufacturing plants in industries considered to have potential utilizations of AMTs. A cluster analysis of the data yields a solution that closely resembles a previous AMT utilization taxonomy, including four groups labeled, respectively, as Traditionalists, Generalists, High Investors, and Designers. Significant manufacturing capability differences across these four groups indicate that plants that utilize a broader scope of AMTs enjoy a greater breadth of manufacturing capabilities. The implied capability attainment pattern is consistent with cumulative capability theory. However, the results suggest that cost capability is not included in the capability mix when broad‐based AMT utilization is the enabler of capability gains. A post hoc exploration of the AMT groups indicates significant differences in performance across the groups. Collectively, the results extend prior research by providing added insights into the possible rationale and impact of AMT utilization patterns.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2009.01027.x",""

Because both CRP and type 3 pneumococci are reported to bind to complement regulatory protein factor H, we propose that the factor H-binding capability of CRP may contribute to anti-pneumococcal function of CRP. In this study, we explored interactions between CRP and factor H with the aim to generate a CRP mutant incapable of binding to factor H. Surprisingly, we found that freshly-purified CRP did not bind human factor H. But, in the presence of phosphoethanolamine (PEt), freshly-purified CRP bound to human factor H efficiently in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, and as reported previously, when an old preparation of CRP was thawed and used, CRP bound to human factor H even in the absence of PEt. Identical results were obtained with murine factor H. We also found that the mutations at the C1q-binding site on CRP did not affect the binding of PEt-complexed CRP to factor H, indicating separate binding sites on CRP for C1q and factor H. The mechanism of action of PEt in the binding of CRP to factor H is unknown; however, it seems that PEt modifies CRP in a way similar to storage-induced modification of CRP. Our findings raise the possibility that CRP, once in contact with a PEt-containing surface, gains factor H-binding specificity to modulate the complement attack on factor H-bound pneumococci.

In this work, meteorological forcing mechanisms, such as the Ekman spiral, thermal wind, and inertial oscillation, are discussed as likely drivers of such shears in the statically stable environment. Since the inertial oscillation, the Ekman spiral, and statically stable conditions are independent of geography, potentially significant magnitudes of speed and direction shear are hypothesized to occur to some extent at any inland site in the world. The frequency of occurrence of non-trivial magnitudes of speed and direction shear are analyzed from observation platforms in Lubbock, Texas and Goodland, Indiana. On average, the correlation between speed and direction shear magnitudes and static atmospheric stability are found to be very high. Moreover, large magnitude speed and direction shears are observed in conditions with relatively high hub-height wind speeds. The effects of speed and direction shear on wind turbine power performance are tested by incorporating a simple steady direction shear profile into the fatigue analysis structures and turbulence simulation code from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. In general, the effect on turbine power production varies with the magnitude of speed and direction shear across the turbine rotor, with the majority of simulated conditions exhibiting power loss relative to a zero shear baseline. When coupled with observational data, the observed power gain is calculated to be as great as 0.5% and depletion as great as 3% relative to a no shear baseline.

We found that dendritic cells (DCs) of WNV infected TCRδ-/-mice had reduced levels of CD40, CD80, CD86 and major compatibility complex (MHC) II expression and IL-12 production than wild-type mice. We also detected a significant viral load in WNV infected γδ T cells. Infected γδ T cells produced high levels of IFN-γ and proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-6, which were known to promote DC maturation. Nevertheless, levels of Toll-like receptors (TLR) 2, 3, 4 and 7 in these cells were not different from those of non-infected, suggesting a TLR-independent activation following infection.

By introducing ambiguous data in a way that removes confounding factors, we provide the first clear understanding of 1 mechanism by which ambiguous data can mislead phylogenetic analyses. We find that in both ML and Bayesian frameworks, among-site rate variation can interact with ambiguous data to produce misleading estimates of topology and branch lengths. Furthermore, within a Bayesian framework, priors on branch lengths and rate heterogeneity parameters can exacerbate the effects of ambiguous data, resulting in strongly misleading bipartition posterior probabilities. The magnitude and direction of the ambiguous data bias are a function of the number and taxonomic distribution of ambiguous characters, the strength of topological support, and whether or not the model is correctly specified.

MiRNAs expression is de-regulated in AML, but the corresponding functional miRNA-controlled pathways remain unknown. The availability of data from gene and miRNA expression profiling may allow generation of functional links from the whole transcriptome and miRNome that are involved in myeloid leukemogenesis. Therefore, here we proposed to attain distinct miRNA-associated gene expression signatures by correlating miRNA expression levels detected by miRNA microarrays with mRNA expression levels assessed by Affymetrix microarrays from newly diagnosed AML patients. Methods: miRNA and mRNA gene expression levels were assessed by Affymetrix HGU133 microchip and OSUCCC miRNA microchip version 3, respectively, in diagnostic samples from 48 newly diagnosed AML patients. Patient characteristics include; median age 59 years (range 24-81) with cytogenetically normal (n=32), core binding factor (n=3), t11q23 (n=8), t(15;17) (n=4) and del9q (n=1). The miRNA/mRNA correlations were performed using quantitative trait analysis (Spearman correlation test) within the BRB tools. We derived gene expression signatures associated with the following miRNAs; miR-10a,-10b,-155,-181,-191,-23a,-26a,-126,-17,-20,-25,-145,-146,-21,-29a,-29b,-196,-15a and -16-1, which we found to be deregulated in AML (Garzon et al, Blood 2008). To asses functional characteristics, we determined which biologic terms included in the Gene Ontology (GO) project were enriched in the distinct miRNA-associated signatures, at a level of significance of P<0.01. Results: In table 1, we report the numbers of probes that correlate positively and negatively with the selected miRNAs at the p-value<0.01 (Spearman), and the GO terms that are over-represented in each miRNA-associated signature at the p-value<0.01. Since some of the Affymetrix probes detect miRNA expression (i.e. miR-155 probe) we used them as quality controls. The miR-155 Affymetrix probe expression value was indeed positively correlated with the miR-155 expression value detected by miRNA microarrays (r=0.64, p-value<0.001). Our analysis identified a strong positive correlation of HOX related genes with miR-10 and miR-20a. Furthermore, we observed a negative correlation between miR-181a and –b, -155 and -146 expression with that of genes involved in immunity and inflammatory response (e.g. IRF7 and TLR4), the miR-29b, miR-23a and miR-26a expression with that of antiapoptotic genes (e.g.,MCL-1) and the miR-145 expression with that of pro-apoptotic genes (e.g., Bim and PTEN). These correlations were confirmed by GO analyses, which evidenced the enrichment of members of the homeobox, immunity and inflammation and apoptosis biologic process, respectively. Furthermore, we observed correlation of miR-17,-191,-196a, 29b, -145 and -16 with gene encoding for members of the GO term chromatin modification.

Factors postulated as mediators were family support and religiosity. Systematic across‐group comparison analyses were conducted to examine sources of differences in the mediation model between immigrant and non‐immigrant women. The results partially supported the hypothesized mediation model, indicating that family support, but not religiosity, was a significant mediator in the relationship between ethnic pride and mental health problems. In addition, as differences between immigrant and non‐immigrant women were observed only in the variables means, but not in the factor loadings or regression paths, the model tested may capture a common psychosocial process that affects these women and their health outcomes. Overall, this study offers important implications for future research and the design of intervention programs for Mexican American women.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1007/s10464-008-9221-9",""

The case studied is Hurricane Humberto (2007), the first landfalling hurricane in the United States since the end of the 2005 hurricane season and the most rapidly intensifying near-landfall storm in U.S. history. The storm caused extensive damage along the southeast Texas coast but was poorly predicted by operational models and forecasters. It is found that the EnKF analysis, after assimilating radial velocity observations from three Weather Surveillance Radars-1988 Doppler (WSR-88Ds) along the Gulf coast, closely represents the best-track position and intensity of Humberto. Deterministic forecasts initialized from the EnKF analysis, despite displaying considerable variability with different lead times, are also capable of predicting the rapid formation and intensification of the hurricane. These forecasts are also superior to simulations without radar data assimilation or with a three-dimensional variational scheme assimilating the same radar observations. Moreover, nearly all members from the ensemble forecasts initialized with EnKF analysis perturbations predict rapid formation and intensification of the storm. However, the large ensemble spread of peak intensity, which ranges from a tropical storm to a category 2 hurricane, echoes limited predictability in deterministic forecasts of the storm and the potential of using ensembles for probabilistic forecasts of hurricanes.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/2009MWR2645.1",""

Although the different NF-κB inhibitors can all inhibit NF-κB in vitro, their physiological functions are incompletely understood. In this study, we demonstrate that p105 plays an important role in the regulation of T cell homeostasis and prevention of chronic inflammation. Mice lacking p105, but expressing the mature NF-κB1 p50, spontaneously develop intestinal inflammation with features of human inflammatory bowel disease. This inflammatory disorder occurs under specific pathogen-free conditions and critically involves T cells. Consistently, the p105-deficient mice have reduced frequency of naive T cells and increased frequency of memory/effector T cells in the peripheral lymphoid organs. Although p105 is dispensable for the production of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells, p105 deficiency renders CD4 T cells more resistant to Treg-mediated inhibition. We further show that the loss of p105 results in hyperproduction of Th17 subset of inflammatory T cells. Together, these findings suggest a critical role for NF-κB1 p105 in the regulation of T cell homeostasis and differentiation and the control of chronic inflammation.","https://journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article-pdf/182/5/3131/1276690/zim00509003131.pdf",""

Indeed, geographical/spatial methods are an increasingly important tool in understanding public health issues. Spatial analysis addresses a seemingly obvious yet relatively misunderstood aspect of public health, namely, studying the dynamics of people in places. As advances in computer technology increase almost exponentially, computer intensive spatial methods (including mapping) have become an appealing way to understand the manner in which the individual relates to larger frameworks that compose the human community and the physical nature of human environments (streets with intersections, dense vs. sparse neighborhoods, high or low densities of liquor stores or restaurants, etc.). Spatial methods are extremely data intensive, often pulling together information from disparate sources that have been collected for other purposes such as research, business practice, governmental policy, and law enforcement. Although initially more demanding in regard to data manipulation compared to typical population level methods, the ability to compile and compare data in a spatial framework provides information about human populations that lies beyond typical survey or census research. We will discuss general methods of spatial analysis and mapping that will help to elucidate when and how spatial analysis might be used in a public health setting. This discussion will include a method for transforming arbitrary administrative units, such as zip codes, into a more useable uniform grid structure. In addition, a practical research example will be discussed focusing on the relationship between alcohol and violence. A relatively new Bayesian spatial method will be part of this example.","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=13796",""

Analysis is achieved in this method by querying the user. The user interaction is kept to a maximum of thirty pair-wise comparisons of candidates. From the data gathered from the comparisons, a stochastic decision making process infers what candidate solutions best meet the user’s preference. The method is implemented and applied to a grammar for tying neckties. It is shown through 21 user experiments and 4000 automated experiments that the method consistently finds solutions within the 99.8 percentile.

A virtual backbone can significantly improve network throughput, optimize broadband utilization, extend network lifetime, and reduce interference as well as packet retransmissions. Calculating a minimum backbone for a network is critical to reduce routing computation and energy consumption. This problem is a well-known NP-hard optimization problem, which has various applications in practice. In this paper, we propose a new problem based on customer fairness, which looks for a minimum CDS in a given communication model with shortest path constraints. It guarantees that any two clients can communicate with each other through this CDS with hop counts the same as the best path from the original graph, which means that routing on such a CDS will not bring additional traffic for every client. We name this problem as shortest path connected dominating set (SPCDS) and prove its NP-hardness by reduction from Hitting Set. Then we propose a centralized greedy algorithm and an efficient distributed approximation algorithm with approximation ratio Δ to solve SPCDS, where Δ is the maximum vertex degree in the given topology. We also analyze the time complexity, message complexity, and evaluate the efficiency of our distributed heuristic by several numerical experiments and comparisons with previous literatures.","https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S1793830909000348",""

While the structural consequences of domain swapping have been well documented, little is understood about the specific structural and energetic features that cause this unique folding phenomenon to occur. An increased frequency of proline residues has been observed in hinge regions preceding swapped structural units, implying that the cis‐trans isomerization of proline may play an important role in domain swapping. For example, a trans proline may help extend the swapped arm, making it more accessible for exchange, while a cis‐proline may act as a conformational gatekeeper to prevent domain swapping by biasing the swapped arm towards contacts with the core of its own monomeric unit. Using RNase A as a model system, we have examined the role of a hinge region proline that undergoes cis to trans isomerization as the protein forms a domain‐swapped dimer. Results suggest that replacing the cis‐proline in the hinge region with a residue that energetically favors a trans configuration dramatically increases the ability of RNase A to form domain‐swapped dimers under physiological conditions.","",""

We have previously shown that miR-29 expression is down-regulated in cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) with wild type NPM1 and in t(11q23) primary blasts. Functionally, restoration of miR-29b in AML cell lines and primary samples induces apoptosis and dramatically reduces tumorigenicity in a xenograft leukemia model (Garzon et al, EHA 2008). Despite, these studies supporting a tumor suppressor role of miR-29b in AML, little is known about how miR-29 expression is down-regulated in AML. Since, miRNAs could be target for mutation, here we propose to screen mutations that could affect miR-29 expression and function. Methods:: The miR-29 family is comprised of three isoforms arranged in 2 clusters; miR-29b-1 and -a located on chromosome 7q32 and miR-29b-2 and -c located on chromosome 1q23. To screen for mutations, the entire genomic region from blasts of 100 primary AML samples corresponding to the miR-29b-1 and -a cluster, including 200 bp at the 5' and 3' ends was amplified and sequenced using the Applied Biosystems DNA sequencing system. When a deviation from the normal sequence was found, a panel of DNA from the blood of 50 control subjects was screened to identify polymorphisms. Patient characteristics include: CN-AML: 62 (FLT3-ITD 10/43, NPM1 mutated (34/62); inv16: 10; t(8;21): 2; t11q23: 2; complex karyotype (CK): 10; monosomy 7(-7): 7; other cytogenetics: 7. miR-29 expression we performed by miRNA Taqman assays as per manufacturer recommendations. Results:: We identified a thymidine (T) base deletion within the miR-29b-1 and -a cluster precursor miRNAs (at -264 bp from the 5' position of miR-29a in chromosome 7q32) in 17/100 patients. The (T) base deletion was observed in 4/10 inv16 and 6/62 CN-AML patients, while the other 7 cases were distributed among CK (2/10), -7 (3/7), 11q23 (1/2) and other cytogenetics (1/7). In 2 patients, normal cells from the buccal mucosa were heterozygous for this abnormality. The frequency of this germline abnormality in the normal population was 16% (8/50 cases). Next, we investigated the miR-29b and -a expression in 35/100 primary AML samples, where RNA was also available. Although miR-29a and -b levels were not significantly different in polymorphism (n=10) versus wild type (WT) (n=35) samples, we observed that the miR-29a/miR-29b ratios were significantly lower in the polymorphism than WT (43.5 vs. 24.9 respectively, P-value=0.007, t-test). To characterize further this abnormality, we cloned the polymorphism harboring miR-29b and -a cluster from 1 patient into p-Retro Super plasmid and transfected into K562 cells (lack miR-29 expression) along with WT and empty vector constructs. Northern blotting after 24-48 hours revealed an accumulation of the precursor miR-29a while the mature miR-29a level was decreased by 2 fold. The level of the mature miR-29b was unchanged. To asses whether this polymorphism affects miR-29 targeting efficiency, we co-transfected a reporter luciferase construct containing the 3' untranslated region of the known miR-29 target, MCL-1 with the WT, empty vector and polymorphism harboring miR-29b and -a cluster and performed luciferase assays. Interestingly, relative normalized luciferase activities were less inhibited with the polymorphism cluster than the WT construct (relative reduction WT:80%, Polym:63%. Likewise, MCL-1 protein down-regulation elicited by the ectopic WT cluster overexpression was stronger than the one observed for the polymorphism harboring cluster (b-actin/MCL-1 rations 0.35 vs 0.48, respectively). Conclusions:: Our results identify a novel germline polymorphism within the miR-29b and —a cluster in AML. The frequency of this polymorphism in AML is similar to the normal population. However, the increased frequency observed in the inv16 subgroup (4/10) warrant further confirmation in a large cohort of patients. Functionally, this polymorphism affects the expression ratio of miR-29b and —a by dampening the processing of miR-29a and impacts negatively in the ability of this cluster to target the oncogene MCL-1. Disclosures:: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.","https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/114/22/1975/111467/Discovery-and-Functional-Implications-of-a-Novel",""

Thirty-seven percent of black adolescents skipped breakfast, 19% consumed RTEC at breakfast, and 44% consumed other breakfasts. RTEC breakfast and other breakfast consumers had higher mean energy intakes than breakfast skippers (P ≤ .05). After adjusting for gender and energy intake, RTEC breakfast consumers had higher intakes of thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folate, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, zinc, potassium, and vitamins A, B6, and B12 than breakfast skippers and other breakfast consumers (P ≤ .05). RTEC breakfast consumers had the highest mean adequacy ratio, followed by other breakfast consumers, then breakfast skippers (P ≤ .05). Those consuming RTEC at breakfast had lower mean body mass index (P ≤ .05) and waist circumference (P ≤ .05) than breakfast skippers; however, there was no difference between those consuming RTEC and other breakfasts.

We have shown that: (i) cholangiocytes express VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3; (ii) VEGF-A and VEGF-C stimulate cholangiocyte proliferation via an autocrine mechanism; and (iii) chronic administration of VEGF-A prevents cholangiocyte damage induced by hepatic artery ligation. Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) induces growth inhibition in different cells. Taurocholic acid (TC) protects cholangiocytes against injury induced by parasympathetic or sympathetic denervation. The aims of this study were to determine if: (i) CAPE induces bile duct damage; and (ii) TC prevents CAPE-induced bile duct damage by increasing cholangiocyte VEGF expression. Methods: Normal and BDL rats (immediately after surgery) were fed 1% TC or control diet in the absence/presence of daily IP injections of CAPE (10 mg/Kg BW). One week later, we evaluated: (i) cholangiocyte apoptosis, proliferation and ductal mass in liver sections; (ii) functional activity by measuring secretin-stimulated bile and bicarbonate secretion; and (iii) VEGF-A/C and VEGFR-2/R-3 expression in liver sections. In vitro, BDL cholangiocytes were exposed to CAPE (40 μM) in the absence/presence of TC (40 μM) with and without pretreatment with VEGF receptor inhibitors before evaluating cholangiocyte apoptosis and proliferation. Results: Chronic CAPE administration to BDL rats increased cholangiocyte apoptosis and decreased ductal mass. This effect was associated with reduced expression of VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3. In vivo, TC feeding partly prevented CAPE-induced changes in cholangiocyte apoptosis and growth and loss of ductal secretion. The protective effect of TC was associated with enhanced VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3. In vitro, TC partially prevented CAPE-induced increases in apoptosis and decreases in cholangiocyte proliferation. These changes were reversed by pretreatment with VEGF-receptor inhibitors. Conclusion: Manipulation of cholangiocyte VEGF expression by bile acids may be important in preventing the impairment of cholangiocyte proliferation by exogenous agents.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3181/0808-RM-255",""

Sublethal effects of catch-and-release fishing: measuring capture stress, fish impairment, and predation risk using a condition index. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 513–521. The sublethal effects of simulated capture of red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) were analysed using physiological responses, condition indexing, and performance variables. Simulated catch-and-release fishing included combinations of depth of capture and thermocline exposure reflective of environmental conditions experienced in the Gulf of Mexico. Frequency of occurrence of barotrauma and lack of reflex response exhibited considerable individual variation. When combined into a single condition or impairment index, individual variation was reduced, and impairment showed significant increases as depth increased and with the addition of thermocline exposure. Performance variables, such as burst swimming speed (BSS) and simulated predator approach distance (AD), were also significantly different by depth. BSSs and predator ADs decreased with increasing depth, were lowest immediately after release, and were affected for up to 15 min, with longer recovery times required as depth increased. The impairment score developed was positively correlated with cortisol concentration and negatively correlated with both BSS and simulated predator AD. The impairment index proved to be an efficient method to estimate the overall impairment of red snapper in the laboratory simulations of capture and shows promise for use in field conditions, to estimate release mortality and vulnerability to predation.","http://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-pdf/67/3/513/29136304/fsp255.pdf",""

In this paper we present a method for producing free-space propagating shocks, measurements of rise time with minimal contamination by turbulence, and model results that account for spreading, absorption (including molecular relaxation), and nonlinearity. The shocks are produced using an acoustic pipe filter to condition the irregular pressure release of either balloon pops or starter-pistol shots. The shocks range in peak pressure from 10 to 1000 Pa and in rise time from 10 to 0.5 μs. Rise-time measurements are made using a custom piezoelectric polymer wideband microphone with a measurement range that overlaps with that of a diffraction-corrected 1/8-inch measurement microphone. The exponential-decay time constant beyond the pressure peak is typically less than 100 μs, which may be too rapid to permit development of characteristics associated with relaxation mechanisms: rise times over the entire range measured here are well predicted by accounting for classical and rotational absorption only.","https://pubs.aip.org/jasa/article/125/4_Supplement/2631/714129/Rise-times-of-low-energy-free-space-propagating",""

Gemcitabine alone or in combination with other conventional therapeutics is the standard of care for the treatment of advanced PC without any significant improvement in the overall survival of patients diagnosed with this deadly disease. Previous studies have shown that PC cells that are gemcitabine-resistant (GR) acquired epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype, which is reminiscent of “cancer stem-like cells”; however, the molecular mechanism that led to EMT phenotype has not been fully investigated. The present study shows that Notch-2 and its ligand, Jagged-1, are highly up-regulated in GR cells, which is consistent with the role of the Notch signaling pathway in the acquisition of EMT and cancer stem-like cell phenotype. We also found that the down-regulation of Notch signaling was associated with decreased invasive behavior of GR cells. Moreover, down-regulation of Notch signaling by siRNA approach led to partial reversal of the EMT phenotype, resulting in the mesenchymal-epithelial transition, which was associated with decreased expression of vimentin, ZEB1, Slug, Snail, and nuclear factor-κB. These results provide molecular evidence showing that the activation of Notch signaling is mechanistically linked with chemoresistance phenotype (EMT phenotype) of PC cells, suggesting that the inactivation of Notch signaling by novel strategies could be a potential targeted therapeutic approach for overcoming chemoresistance toward the prevention of tumor progression and/or treatment of metastatic PC.

Depletion of NK cells before nasal-pulmonary immunization enhanced resistance to mycoplasma respiratory infection. The effect of NK cells on the generation of protective immunity in lungs was dependent on lymphoid cells, as immunization of either SCID mice or immunocompetent mice depleted of CD4+ T cells did not demonstrate any increased resistance in the presence or absence of NK cells. The presence of NK cells at the time of nasal-pulmonary immunization modulated mycoplasma-specific cytokine responses in lungs and lower respiratory nodes. In particular, NK cells skewed the mycoplasma-specific T cell cytokine responses in the draining lymph nodes to higher IL-4, IL-13, and IL-17 while lowering IFN-γ responses. Adoptive transfer of total lung lymphocytes isolated from immunized mice into naive mice led to a significant reduction in the mycoplasma numbers in lungs, and the resistance was greater if cells were obtained from immunized mice that were depleted of NK cells. Similar results were obtained if purified B cells, T cells, or CD4+ T cells were used. Interestingly, this is the first time that a favorable role of functional CD4+ T cells in mediating protection in mycoplasma respiratory disease was demonstrated. Thus, NK cells can influence the responses of multiple lymphocyte populations capable of mediating resistance to mycoplasma infection.","https://journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article-pdf/183/4/2622/1284612/zim01609002622.pdf",""

Then we extrapolated this model to climate conditions expected in 2100. We predict that there is less than 20% possibility of hatchling turtles growing during their first year. Reduced annual growth rates during later years may cause earlier termination of growth, smaller standard carapace lengths, and reduced fecundity. These responses are typical of those that stimulate an extinction vortex. These findings provide for a general understanding of how this species and other terrestrial reptiles may respond to climate change.

With the exception of the tuberous sclerosis complex, the molecular basis of most types of cortical dysplasia is completely unknown. Currently, there are no good animal models available that recapitulate key features of the disease, such as structural cortical abnormalities and seizures, hindering progress in understanding and treating cortical dysplasia. At the neuroanatomical level, cortical abnormalities may include dyslamination and the presence of abnormal cell types, such as enlarged and misoriented neurons and neuroglial cells. Recent studies in resected human brain tissue suggested that a misregulation of the PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)-Akt-mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling pathway might be responsible for the excessive growth of dysplastic cells in this disease. Here, we characterize neuronal subset (NS)-Pten mutant mice as an animal model of cortical dysplasia. In these mice, the Pten gene, which encodes a suppressor of the PI3K pathway, was selectively disrupted in a subset of neurons by using Cre-loxP technology. Our data indicate that these mutant mice, like cortical dysplasia patients, exhibit enlarged cortical neurons with increased mTOR activity, and abnormal electroencephalographic activity with spontaneous seizures. We also demonstrate that a short-term treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin strongly suppresses the severity and the duration of the seizure activity. These findings support the possibility that this drug may be developed as a novel antiepileptic treatment for patients with cortical dysplasia and similar disorders.","http://journals.biologists.com/dmm/article-pdf/2/7-8/389/1616680/389.pdf",""

We identified two distinct subregions, hapL (P = 3.20 × 10−6) and hapN (P = 1.51 × 10−6), which were significantly associated with familial lung cancer. hapL encompasses IREB2, LOC123688, and PSMA4, and hapN encompasses the three nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit genes CHRNA5, CHRNA3, and CHRNB4. Examination of the genes around hapL revealed that PSMA4 plays a role in promoting cancer cell proliferation. PSMA4 mRNA levels were increased in lung tumors compared with normal lung tissues. Down-regulation of PSMA4 expression decreased proteasome activity and induced apoptosis. Proteasome dysfunction leads to many diseases including cancer, and drugs that inhibit proteasome activity show promise as a form of cancer treatment. Genes around hapN were also investigated, but did not show any direct effect on lung cancer cell proliferation. We concluded that PSMA4 is a strong candidate mediator of lung cancer cell growth, and may directly affect lung cancer susceptibility through its modulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis.

This new approach provides those who model urban systems and engineer the environment as well as other scientists and policy makers an expanded understanding of how intervention to the system can most effectively be accomplished through enhanced modeling. An object-oriented analysis regime is presented for an industrial park utilizing commercial software in conjunction with multispectral and panchromatic Quickbird satellite imagery. A detailed examination of hot-mix asphalt paved surfaces was undertaken in relation to the materials’ engineered function such as various types of streets, parking, etc. The results were validated using a commercial raster graphics editor and data analysis software as well as on-site inspections.

The method used is based on generalizing results on shear flow phenomena from the hydrodynamics community. In the 1990s, it was realized that fluctuation modes of spectrally stable nonuniform (sheared) flows are non-normal. That is, the linear operators of the flows modal analysis are non-normal and the corresponding eigenmodes are not orthogonal. The non-normality results in linear transient growth with bursts of the perturbations and the mode coupling, which causes the generation of electromagnetic waves from the drift wave–shear flow system. We consider shear flow that mimics tokamak zonal flow. We show that the transient growth substantially exceeds the growth of the classical dissipative trapped-particle instability of the system.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pop/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.3211197/13937525/092102_1_online.pdf",""

Walkers are commonly used by older adults for enhancing mobility. This study aimed to investigate the level of fear of falling in terms of the Falls Efficacy Scale, how that level is associated with fall frequency, and how walkers were used among older walker users. Methods: Forty two qualified older adults completed the Falls Efficacy Scale and a questionnaire concerning walker use and history of falls in the last 12 months. Their walkers were assessed for appropriate use and maintenance. Findings: Fifteen subjects (36%) fell at least once after beginning to use a walker, but the number of falls did not correlate to the duration of walker use. A moderate positive correlation existed between Falls Efficacy Scale scores and the number of falls. Assessments of the walkers showed that the most common misuse was lack of medical consultation in obtaining a walker, followed by incorrect walker height, forward-leaning posture during ambulation. However, the most significant difference (P<0.05) between the fallers and the non-fallers was only identified in poor posture problems. Conclusions: Inappropriate use of a walker, especially the forward-leaning posture, may be associated with the falls. Falls may increase the fear of falling in older walker users. Clinicians including physicians, therapists, and nurses should possess knowledge to instruct older adults on appropriate walker use.","http://www.magonlinelibrary.com/doi/pdf/10.12968/ijtr.2009.16.12.45423",""

Opportunity wages based on past teacher movements to other competing districts and professions are found to pull teachers away from their initial placements. Once opportunity wages and working conditions are considered, teachers' own salaries are found to exert little impact on teacher mobility within the profession; although, they reduce attrition out of the profession.

A parallel hybrid optimization framework that uses genetic algorithms (GA) coupled with local search approaches (GA-LS) has been developed previously to solve groundwater inverse problems. In this study, the identification of an emplaced source at the Borden site is carried out as a test problem using this optimization framework by using a Real Genetic Algorithm (RGA) as the GA approach and a Nelder–Mead simplex as the LS approach. The RGA results showed that the minimum objective function did not always correspond to the minimum solution error, indicating a possible non-uniqueness issue. To address this problem, a procedure to identify maximally different starting points for LS is introduced. When measurement or model errors are non-existent or minimal it is shown that one of these starting points leads to the true solution. When these errors are significant, this procedure leads to multiple possible solutions that could be used as a basis for further investigation. Metrics of mean and standard deviation of objective function values was adopted to evaluate the possible solutions. A new selection criterion based on these metrics is suggested to find the best alternative. This suggests that this alternative generation procedure could be used to address the non-uniqueness of similar inverse problems. A potential limitation of this approach is the application to a wide class of problems, as verification has not been performed with a large number of test cases or other inverse problems.

Here, we show that deacetylase inhibition led to the E2F1- and myc-mediated transcriptional activation of the microRNA miR106b in primary CLL cells. Induction of miR106b was associated with a down-regulation in the levels of the E3-ubiquitin ligase Itch. Decreases in Itch protein levels were associated with a reciprocal accumulation of its proapoptotic substrate, TAp73 (p73), and induction of p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) mRNA and protein. This event was accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction, processing of caspase-9, and apoptosis of CLL cells. Ectopic expression of miR106b in CLL cells demonstrated that Itch was a direct target of miR106b such that miR106b-induced decreases in Itch resulted in an accumulation of p73. Thus, our results identify a novel regulatory mechanism wherein microRNA regulate cell survival by mediating the posttranscriptional down-regulation of an ubiquitin ligase, leading to the induction of a proapoptotic regulator in malignant cells. Silencing of miRNA expression in CLL may selectively suppress proapoptotic pathways, providing such tumors with a survival advantage. Consequently, chemotherapeutic drugs that activate miR106b could initiate a p53-independent mechanism that targets CLL cells.","http://ashpublications.org/blood/article-pdf/113/16/3744/1308412/zh801609003744.pdf",""

Four leading PGR models appear to be overpredicting uplift rates in the Transantarctic Mountains and West Antarctica and underpredicting them in the peninsula north of 65°. This discrepancy cannot be explained in terms of an elastic response to modern ice loss (except, perhaps, in part of the peninsula).

This sensitivity is caused by the fact that the mathematical description becomes ill-posed at a certain level of accumulated damage. A well-posed problem can be recovered by using a gradient-enhanced damage model in which a material length scale is introduced as a localization limiter. In this work, a nonlocal gradient-enhanced fully coupled plastic-damage constitutive model for plain concrete is developed. Anisotropic damage with a plasticity yield criterion and a damage criterion are introduced to be able to adequately describe the plastic and damage behavior of concrete. In order to account for different effects under tensile and compressive loadings, nonlocal damage variables that account for the progressive degradation of mechanical properties under stress states of prevailing tension and compression and two internal length scales, one for tension and the other for compression, are introduced as localization limiters. Therefore, two nonlocal damage criteria are used: one for compression and a second for tension such that the total stress is decomposed into tensile and compressive components. In order to solve the time step problem, a decoupled elastic predictor and plastic corrector steps are performed first in the effective configuration where damage is absent, and then a nonlocal damage corrector step is applied in order to update the final stress state. The algorithmic treatment of both tension and compression is presented in a unified way. A simple procedure to calculate the gradient of the tensile/compressive damage variables is described which can be used directly without the need of intensive numerical modifications of an existing finite element code. The effectiveness of the proposed local model has been demonstrated in both uniaxial and biaxial tension and compression problems and compared with experimental data. Numerical results obtained with the proposed nonlocal model are compared with experimental results concerning bending of three-point notched and four-point notched concrete beams. As the mesh is refined, convergence of numerical results is observed both in terms of damage patterns and of the global response.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1056789508097541",""

Gubernatorial electoral success is a fundamental question, given the prominence of governors in state politics and the importance of states in the federal system. Here, we develop a model that explains the election of Republican gubernatorial candidates. We find that election of Republican governors in the South was delayed because of a comparative lack of quality Republican gubernatorial candidates in that region throughout much of the 20th century. Our research clarifies the contradictions reported in prior work by demonstrating that the effect of candidate quality varies by party and region. Interestingly, the competitive advantage once enjoyed by the Democratic Party in the South is now firmly held by the Republican Party.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1532673X09336890",""

Although it is known that neutrophils are required for elimination of the bacteria and for survival of the host, the mechanisms governing the recruitment of neutrophils to LM-infected tissues are not fully understood. We demonstrate here that IL-23 and the IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA), which mediates both IL-17A and IL-17F signaling, are necessary for resistance against systemic LM infection. LM-infected IL-23p19 knockout (KO) mice have decreased production of IL-17A and IL-17F, while IFN-γ production is not altered by the lack of IL-23. LM induces the production of IL-17A from γδ T cells, but not CD4, CD8, or NK cells. Furthermore, a lack of efficient neutrophil recruitment to the liver is evident in both IL-23p19 KO and IL-17RA KO mice during LM infection. Immunocytochemical analysis of infected livers revealed that neutrophils were able to localize with LM in IL-23p19 KO and IL-17RA KO mice, indicating that IL-23 and IL-17RA do not regulate the precise localization of neutrophils with LM. The importance of IL-23-induced IL-17A was demonstrated by injecting IL-23p19 KO mice with recombinant IL-17A. These mice had reduced LM bacterial burdens compared with IL-23p19 KO mice that did not receive IL-17A. These results indicate that during LM infection, IL-23 regulates the production of IL-17A and IL-17F from γδ T cells, resulting in optimal liver neutrophil recruitment and enhanced bacterial clearance.","https://journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article-pdf/183/12/8026/1282111/zim02409008026.pdf",""

The simulation finite size effect, gold substrate thickness effect, temperature effect, normal pressure effect, molecule chain length effect, and molecule coverage effect on thermal conductivity/conductance were studied. Vibration power spectra of gold atoms in the substrate and sulfur atoms in the SAM were calculated, and vibration coupling of these two parts was analyzed. The calculated thermal conductance values of Au-SAM-Au junctions are in the range of experimental data on metal-nonmetal junctions. The temperature dependence of thermal conductance has a similar trend to experimental observations.

Exclusion criteria included bone fractures, BMD T-scores worse than –2.0, creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/min, dental problems, and recent steroid or bisphosphonate use. Patients on study were stratified as male, pre-menopausal female, or post-menopausal female. Accrued patients were randomized to receive either: 1) oral calcium and vitamin D (Ca+D) or 2) Ca+D and 4 mg zoledronic acid IV at baseline and at 6 months. Urine NTx and bone specific AP levels were measured at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Results: To date, 33 patients have completed the study and have evaluable data. Patient characteristics include: 17 male, 4 pre-menopausal female, 12 post-menopausal female, median age 62 (range 33 – 80). Seventeen patients had osteopenia upon enrollment. Patients that received zoledronic acid had stable median T-scores at all locations during the 12 month observation, whereas the T-scores of the control group decreased at every location evaluated (Location: L1-4, p=0.004; L Neck, p= 0.001; L Hip, p=0.118; R Neck, p=0.009; R Hip, p=0.040). Each group had a similar baseline level of urine NTx and bone specific AP. At 6 months, the urine NTx decreased significantly in the zoledronic acid-treated group compared to urine NTx levels in the control group which increased (p<0.001). The separation between groups remained constant throughout the evaluation period (12 months, p<0.001). The bone specific AP level decreased in the zoledronic acid group by 3 months, and remained below baseline levels at 12 months. The control group had increases in bone specific AP levels throughout the 12 month period (6 months, p=0.001; 12 months, p<0.001). Conclusions: Treatment with zoledronic acid in newly-diagnosed lymphoma patients prevents the bone mineral density loss commonly seen in this population. Bone mass lost is difficult to restore, thus necessitating effective prevention strategies. Urine NTx and bone specific AP levels demonstrate early response to bisphosphonate therapy. The ability to predict response to bisphosphonates at 6 months may allow for early intervention, potentially preventing further bone loss. Our study demonstrates the bone markers urine NTx and bone specific AP are significantly associated with bone health in lymphoma patients receiving chemotherapy.

Chlorotic streaks were more frequently associated with WSMV, WMoV, and TriMV (R = 0.166 to 0.342; P < 0.05), and stunting was more frequently associated with WMoV (R = 0.142; P = 0.004) or TriMV (R = 0.107; P = 0.033) than WSMV. Symptom severity did not increase with co-infection as compared to single virus infections, with the exception of plants co-infected with mite transmitted viruses in Texas.","https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/pdf/10.1094/PHP-2009-0706-01-RS",""

Because F-BAR proteins, including Cdc42 interacting protein-4 (CIP4), drive membrane deformation and affect endocytosis, we investigated the role of CIP4 in GLUT4 traffic by flow cytometry in GLUT4myc-expressing L6 myoblasts (L6 GLUT4myc). L6 GLUT4myc cells express CIP4a as the predominant F-BAR protein. siRNA knockdown of CIP4 increased insulin-stimulated 14C-deoxyglucose uptake by elevating cell-surface GLUT4. Enhanced surface GLUT4 was due to decreased endocytosis, which correlated with lower transferrin internalization. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous CIP4 revealed that CIP4 interacted with N-WASp and Dynamin-2 in an insulin-dependent manner. FRET confirmed the insulin-dependent, subcellular properties of these interactions. Insulin exposure stimulated specific interactions in plasma membrane and cytosolic compartments, followed by a steady-state response that underlies the coordination of proteins needed for GLUT4 traffic. Our findings reveal a physiological function for F-BAR proteins, supporting a previously unrecognized role for the F-BAR protein CIP4 in GLUT4 endocytosis, and show that interactions between CIP4 and Dynamin-2 and between CIP4 and NWASp are spatially coordinated to promote function.","http://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article-pdf/122/13/2283/1500321/2283.pdf",""

Method:: We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the neural correlates of cognitive self-regulation during the Simon task. Forty-two people from The Tic Disorder Specialty Clinic who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria for diagnosis with TS (24 children; 18 adults) were compared with 37 control subjects (19 children; 18 adults). Patients with TS were excluded from participation if they had any Axis I psychiatric disorder other than obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) prior to the onset of TS. Control participants were excluded if they reported a history of tic disorder, OCD, ADHD, or if they met diagnostic criteria for any Axis I disorder at the time of interview. Results:: We detected greater overall fMRI activation in adults than in children across both diagnostic groups, primarily in frontal and striatal regions. In both groups we also detected an age-related shift away from more general cortical activation toward a more specific reliance on frontostriatal activity, a developmental correlate that was exaggerated in the TS group despite behavioural performances similar to those of control subjects. Moreover, the severity of tics correlated positively with frontal activations across age groups. Conclusion:: Frontostriatal circuits support cognitive and behavioural control. These circuits likely contribute both to optimal performance in this self-regulatory task and to the regulation of the severity of tics. Adults with persistent TS likely possess deficient activity in these circuits, attributable to either a failure of prefrontal plasticity or to disturbances in striatal functioning.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/070674370905400902",""

In addition, there are ethical challenges associated with collecting repeated biopsies from a patient to develop an understanding of the temporal dynamics of the mechanisms underlying chronic wounds. The need for a preclinical model of ischemic wound is therefore compelling. The porcine model is widely accepted as an excellent preclinical model for human wounds. A full-thickness bipedicle flap approach was adopted to cause skin ischemia. Closure of excisional wounds placed on ischemic tissue was severely impaired resulting in chronic wounds. Histologically, ischemic wounds suffered from impaired re-epithelialization, delayed macrophage recruitment and poorer endothelial cell abundance and organization. Compared with the pair-matched nonischemic wound, unique aspects of the ischemic wound biology were examined on days 3, 7, 14, and 28 by systematic screening of the wound tissue transcriptome using high-density porcine GeneChips. Ischemia markedly potentiated the expression of arginase-1, a cytosolic enzyme that metabolizes the precursor of nitric oxide l-arginine. Ischemia also induced the SOD2 in the wound tissue perhaps as survival response of the challenged tissue. Human chronic wounds also demonstrated elevated expression of SOD2 and arginase-1. This study provides a thorough database that may serve as a valuable reference tool to develop novel hypotheses aiming to elucidate the biology of ischemic chronic wounds in a preclinical setting.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/physiolgenomics.90362.2008",""

Background: Training with metric feedback can improve distance estimations. However, previous research led to the conclusion that those improvements stemmed from changes in cognitive processing rather than in perception. If trainees applied their new cognitive strategies to primarily perceptual-motor tasks, then the performance of those tasks should degrade. The present studies tested that possibility. Method: Experiment 1 sought to replicate that training with metric feedback would improve metric distance estimations. Experiments 2 and 3 investigated whether such training would degrade the performance of a primarily perceptual-motor task. Experiment 4 investigated whether such training would affect a perceptual-motor task that required cognition. Results: Metric feedback improved metric distance estimation (Experiments 1—4) and throwing to a specified distance (Experiment 4). Metric feedback degraded throwing to a target (Experiments 2 and 3), although that effect was not evident when pretesting was omitted (Experiment 3). Conclusion: If distance estimation trainees apply what they learned from metric feedback to untrained primarily perceptual-motor tasks, then the performance of those tasks will suffer. However, if trainees apply what they learned to untrained tasks that require metric estimation, then the performance of those tasks will improve. Application: Distance estimation training with metric feedback may not generalize to other tasks and may even degrade performance on certain tasks. Future research must specify the conditions under which distance estimation training with metric feedback leads to performance improvements and decrements.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0018720809340341",""

A coupled model for predicting buffeting- and vortex shedding–induced response for slender support structures was developed. To accomplish this, monitoring of long-term response behavior of an HMLP subjected to wind-induced vibration and wind tunnel experiments was used to study global behavior and to extract important parameters. From the long-term field monitoring and wind tunnel experiments, the two critical types of wind vibration (natural wind gusts or buffeting and vortex shedding) were individually identified for in-depth analysis. Finally, a coupled dynamic model in time domain was developed for predicting the wind-excited response and was validated by comparing the simulation results with the field-collected data. The fatigue life of a specific HMLP was also estimated with the stress amplitudes predicted by the time-domain model and was validated with statistical extrapolation of the field data.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/2131-03",""

Our results revealed parental concerns about daughters’ weight and pubertal development, as well as differences in their communication with their daughters. Although both parents willingly discussed pubertal issues concerning their daughters, mothers had a more active role in conveying pubertal information to daughters. Among the girls, there was a gap in knowledge about the pubertal process between the younger and older girls.

Here, we report an emerging role of microRNA, the epigenetic deregulation of which may also lead to this oncogenic activation. SOX4, an oncogene belonging to the SRY-related high mobility group box family, was found to be overexpressed (P &lt; 0.005) in endometrial tumors (n = 74) compared with uninvolved controls (n = 20). This gene is computationally predicted to be the target of a microRNA, miR-129-2. When compared with the matched endometria, the expression of miR-129-2 was lost in 27 of 31 primary endometrial tumors that also showed a concomitant gain of SOX4 expression (P &lt; 0.001). This inverse relationship is associated with hypermethylation of the miR-129-2 CpG island, which was observed in endometrial cancer cell lines (n = 6) and 68% of 117 endometrioid endometrial tumors analyzed. Reactivation of miR-129-2 in cancer cells by pharmacologic induction of histone acetylation and DNA demethylation resulted in decreased SOX4 expression. In addition, restoration of miR-129-2 by cell transfection led to decreased SOX4 expression and reduced proliferation of cancer cells. Further analysis found a significant correlation of hypermethylated miR-129-2 with microsatellite instability and MLH1 methylation status (P &lt; 0.001) and poor overall survival (P &lt; 0.039) in patients. Therefore, these results imply that the aberrant expression of SOX4 is, in part, caused by epigenetic repression of miR-129-2 in endometrial cancer. Unlike the notion that promoter hypomethylation may upregulate an oncogene, we present a new paradigm in which hypermethylation-mediated silencing of a microRNA derepresses its oncogenic target in cancer cells.

In this paper, historical aspects of the KZ equation and its generalizations are presented. The interest in nonlinear acoustic beams of Academician Khokhlov and his colleagues at Moscow State University was inspired in the 1960s by emerging developments in laser physics and the corresponding models of nonlinear optical beams. The two cases, acoustical and optical, represent two limiting cases of nonlinear beams in weakly and strongly dispersive media, respectively, which required different theoretical approaches. The KZ equation and analogous nonlinear evolution equations of nonlinear wave physics are reviewed. It is illustrated how theoretical studies combined with numerical modeling resulted in predictions of new physical phenomena in nonlinear acoustic beams. Concurrently, newer applications of nonlinear acoustics such as parametric arrays, sonic booms, and medical acoustics stimulated the derivation of generalized KZ-type equations together with analytical and numerical methods to solve them. Modern applications and corresponding generalized KZ-type models that include effects such as frequency-dependent absorption, weak dispersion, scalar and vectorial inhomogeneities of the propagation medium, different orders of nonlinearity, and more accurate description of diffraction are presented.","https://pubs.aip.org/jasa/article/126/4_Supplement/2200/654173/Historical-aspects-of-the-Khokhlov-Zabolotskaya",""

Conflicts where rebels seem weak can become prolonged if rebels can operate in the periphery so as to defy a government victory yet are not strong enough to extract concessions. Conflicts should be shorter when potential insurgents can rely on alternative political means to violence. We examine these hypotheses in a dyadic analysis of civil war duration and outcomes, using new data on nonstate actors and conflict attributes, finding support for many of our conjectures.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0022002709336458",""

Unfortunately, little is known about residential relocation behavior at the disaggregate level, in terms of both the reasons for relocation and the duration of stay at a given residential location. This paper aims to fill this gap in knowledge by formulating and estimating a joint model of the reason for residential relocation and the duration of stay at a location. The model is estimated on a data set derived from a survey conducted in Zurich, Switzerland, that captures information about residential moves over a 20-year period spanning 1985 to 2004. The paper provides elasticity estimates demonstrating how the model can be applied to evaluate impacts of changes in exogenous factors on residential mobility events.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/2133-07",""

BALB/c mice with 25% TBSA of 3rd degree flame burn were treated i.p. with GL (Minophagen Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at various schedules after burn injury. Eight punch biopsies (8-mm diameter) per mouse were obtained from skin tissues surrounding the burn area of these mice 24 hrs after burn injury. The homogenates of 8 biopsies were assayed for MBD-1 and MBD-3 by ELISA. In the results, normal mouse skin homogenates consistently contained 0.8 ± 0.4 μg/ml of MBD-1 and 6.9 ± 1.8 μg/ml of MBD-3.

The method uses a Fourier series expansion to express the azimuthal dependence of EM fields and the source term whereby the essentially 3D problem collapses to a series of independent 2D problems. Each 2D problem is solved with a semianalytic method that uses normalized Bessel functions and normalized Hankel functions to express the radial dependence of EM fields, thereby improving numerical stability. In addition, use is made of amplitude and slope basis functions to describe the longitudinal dependence of EM fields to avoid grid refinement in the vicinity of horizontal formation boundaries. For validation, we compare the new simulation method to two 1D analytic methods in horizontally and radially layered formations, and to one 3D finite-difference method (3DFD) in multilayered formations that include borehole and invasion zones. Numerical results indicate that the method is accurate in formations with high conductivity contrasts compared to 1D methods and is more than ten times more efficient than the 3DFD method in multilayer formations.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/1.3261745",""

Owing to the recently reported cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a panel of neurologists met in February 2009 to discuss best practices for the use of natalizumab, with the goal of developing consensus-based recommendations on patient management to minimize the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.

Although high levels of costimulatory molecules, e.g. CD40 and CD86, are found in activated Kupffer cells and hepatocytes in patients, the precise role of hepatic CD40 expression in antigen presentation, T cell activation and liver injury in viral hepatitis is not very clear. In this study, we generated conditional transgenic mice having the liver-specific expression of CD40, and induced transgene expression by i.v. injection with 2×109 pfu recombinant replication-deficient adenovirus with Cre. The transgenic mice and their non-transgenic littermates were sacrificed, and the serum and tissue samples were collected at 3, 6, 11, 18 and 27 days post infection. In control mice, the serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were slightly elevated at days 6 and 18, and normal at other time points. Although transgenic mice had relatively normal serum ALT levels at day 3, they displayed a significant elevation of ALT levels to an average of 501 and 366 U/L on days 6 and 11, respectively, followed by decreased levels thereafter. Pathological examinations revealed a relatively mild lymphocyte infiltration in isolated portal areas in control animals at day 6. In contrast, there was significant lymphocyte infiltration in multiple portal areas, as well as in the liver parenchyma, that was accompanied by various degrees of hepatic apoptosis (Councilmen's bodies) and necrosis in transgenic mice at days 6 and 11. These results suggest that CD40 expressed on hepatocytes play a critical role in virus-induced hepatitis.","https://journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article/182/1_Supplement/45.25/45556/Parenchymal-expression-of-CD40-exacerbates-liver",""

The purpose of this study is to calculate the magnetic flux in the magnetotail and in the polar cap during these magnetospheric modes and to establish a quantitative relation between the magnetic flux and the solar wind parameters. We use the Imager for Magnetopause‐to‐Aurora Global Exploration Far Ultraviolet Imager and Polar Ultraviolet Imager measurements to derive the magnetic flux in the polar cap and the Geotail measurements to derive the magnetic flux in the magnetotail. The average value of the magnetic flux at the sawtooth onset is ∼1 GWb in the polar cap and magnetotail, and the relative decrease of the magnetic flux from the maximum value at the sawtooth onset to the minimum value after the onset is 24–26.5%. The average magnetic flux in the polar cap at the onset of isolated substorms is 0.68 GWb and decreases by 26.5% after the expansion phase. The magnetic flux in the polar cap during SMC events varies between 0.3 and 0.8 GWb. The magnetic flux at the isolated substorm onset is at the upper limit of the magnetic flux of SMC events for the same merging electric field, and the magnetic flux at the sawtooth onset is always higher than that during isolated substorms and during SMC events. The magnetic flux in the magnetotail and polar cap during sawtooth events and isolated substorms increases gradually before the onset and then decreases rapidly after the onset, which is consistent with the traditional energy loading‐unloading scenario.

Linage- CD34+ cells were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy donors after 1-hr of programmed exercise, as previously described. CD34+ cells (1 x 105 cells/ml, upper chamber) were transwell-cultured with NHEK (1 x 105 cells/ml, lower chamber) in the presence or absence of GL (Minophagen Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Forty-eight hrs after cultivation, cells in the lower chamber were assayed for human BD-1 and cathelicidin (CAP-18) mRNAs by RT-PCR. BD-1 and CAP-18 mRNAs were consistently expressed by NHEK. However, NHEK transwell-cultured with CD34+ cells did not express these peptide mRNAs. When transwell-cultures between these 2 cells were performed in the presence of 100 μg/ml of GL, mRNAs for BD-1 and CAP-18 were expressed by NHEK. The mRNA expression for BD-1 and CAP-18 by NHEK was not directly influenced by GL.

Codon 12 mutations maintain Ras in a constitutively active state leading to continuous cellular proliferation. Our study determined if TRAIL resistance in pancreatic adenocarcinomas with K-Ras 12 mutations could be overcome by first sensitizing the cells with Benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC).

Near the study area of 30°N, motions in the diurnal–inertial band (DIB) may be significantly enhanced by a near-resonant condition between local inertial and diurnal forcing frequencies. Wavelet analysis is used to quantify the results. Results indicate that diurnal sea-breeze variability peaks in summer and extends at least 300 km offshore with continuous seaward phase propagation. The maximum DIB oceanic response occurs in June when there is a shallow mixed layer, strong stratification, and an approximately 10-day period of continuous sea-breeze forcing. DIB current variance decreases in July and August as the consequence of the deepening of the mixed layer and a more variable phase relationship between the wind and current. River discharge varies interannually and can significantly alter the oceanic response during summer. The “great flood” of the Mississippi River in 1993 deepened the summer mixed layer and reduced the sea-breeze response during that year. Vertically, DIB currents are surface intensified, with a first baroclinic modal structure. The significance of these DIB motions on the shelf is that they can provide considerable vertical mixing in summer, as seen by the suppression of the bulk Richardson number (by a factor of 30) during strong DIB events. This provides a potential mechanism to ventilate seasonally occurring near-bottom hypoxic waters of the coastal ocean.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jpo/article-pdf/39/9/2137/4503915/2009jpo4054_1.pdf",""

We recently demonstrated inhibition of F. tularensis LVS replication in macrophages via mast cell production of interleukin-4 (IL-4). We have further analyzed the interactions of mast cells and macrophages using a primary bone marrow derived mast cell-macrophage co-culture system and determined that mast cells inhibit F. tularensis-induced macrophage apoptosis. Specifically, mast cells co-cultured with macrophages significantly reduced intramacrophage LVS growth and expression of apoptotic proteins caspase-3 (19.9%) and PARP (Poly-ADP ribose polymerase, 16.0%) compared to macrophages cultured alone (48.2% and 56.4%, respectively). The inhibition of LVS-induced apoptosis within infected macrophages also was seen by the direct addition of recombinant IL-4 and corresponded with up-regulation of mannose receptor expression and arginase activity which are associated with the alternative activation of macrophages. Moreover, IL4R-/- mice were more susceptible to intranasal challenge and exhibited greater caspase-3 activity in lung macrophages (12.9%) compared to similarly challenged wild-type (4.7%) animals. These results support a role for mast cells and IL-4 in control of bacterial replication and apoptosis following pulmonary LVS infection.","https://journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article/182/1_Supplement/44.24/45543/Mast-cells-induce-alternative-activation-and",""

Objective:: To describe the pattern of lisdexamfetamine ingestions reported during the first year of their approved use to Texas poison centers. Methods:: The distribution of total cases of lisdexamfetamine ingestions with and without coingestants reported to Texas poison centers from July 2007–June 2008 was determined for the following selected variables: drug formulation, reported total dose ingested, patient sex and age, exposure site, and circumstances of the exposure. Results:: Of 187 total ingestions, the total dose ingested was reported for 59% (mean 221.4 mg; range 5–3,080). Fifty-eight percent of the patients were male and 38% were aged 6–12 years. Thirty-eight percent of the ingestions occurred as a result of therapeutic error, 26% were due to general unintentional reasons, and 12% were suspected attempted suicide; 11% of the patients called the poison center due to an adverse reaction to lisdexamfetamine. Of the 133 (71%) cases without coingestants, 53% were managed on site (ie, not a healthcare facility) and 79% resulted in or were expected to result in, at most, minor effects or minimal toxicity. The most frequently reported adverse clinical effects among cases without coingestants were tachycardia (14%), agitation (14%), vomiting (6%), and nausea (5%). Conclusions:: The majority of lisdexamfetamine ingestions reported to Texas poison centers did not involve coingestants.

It allows the tester to add and modify detailed test parameters (e.g., actual arguments for method invocations and implementation-specific environments) if necessary. When the state model is modified due to requirements change, the hand-crafted test parameters, if still valid, are automatically reused. This reduces the working load for regeneration of tests for modified models. In addition to test code, we also automatically generate state wrapper aspects in AspectJ, which facilitates comparing actual object states to expected states during test execution. This enables the automated verdict of pass/failure for test cases without the need to modify the source code of the class under test. We present two examples for which the executable test code is generated.

However, no studies have described the changes in prevalence among older Mexican Americans. The purpose of this study was to expand on the current literature by examining the trends in diabetes prevalence and diabetes-related complications in Mexican Americans aged ≥75 years from 1993–1994 to 2004–2005. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The prevalences of self-reported diabetes and diabetes-related complications were estimated in the original cohort (1993–1994) and the new cohort (2004–2005) of the Hispanic Established Population for the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly (Hispanic EPESE) and were compared across the two surveys. RESULTS: The prevalence of diabetes among Mexican Americans aged ≥75 years has nearly doubled between 1993–1994 and 2004–2005 from 20.3 to 37.2%, respectively (P &lt; 0.001). The increase in the prevalence of diabetes was similar across all sociodemographic factors. Diabetes complications did not change significantly between the two cohorts. However, the prevalence of having any lower-extremity function disability did increase between the two cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of diabetes in older Mexican Americans has increased dramatically. At the same time, there has been no improvement in diabetes-related complications as has been found in the general older population. These findings heighten the urgency for more effective public health interventions targeted to this population. As diabetes and obesity become more prevalent in older adults, physicians should encourage appropriate management in older patients, including early detection and glycemic control.","https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/32/12/2212/602100/zdc01209002212.pdf",""

Satellite data are from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Microwave Imager and from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager instruments on the operational Defense Meteorological Satellite Program F13, F14, and F15 satellites. These data have been processed into rain-rate estimates by the NASA Precipitation Measurement Mission and by Remote Sensing Systems, Inc. Biases between the different datasets are estimated by computing differences between long-term time averages. Most of the satellite datasets agree with each other, and with the gauge data, to within 10% or less. The biases tend to be proportional to the mean rain rate, but the geographical patterns of bias vary depending on the choice of data source and algorithm. Some datasets, however, show biases as large as about 25%, so care should be taken when using these data for climatological studies.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jamc/article-pdf/48/7/1335/3553415/2009jamc2149_1.pdf",""

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small regulatory ncRNAs, are involved in the pathogenesis of all types of human cancers, including leukemias, mainly via dysregulation of expression of cancer genes. Increasing evidence shows that miRNAs can work as tumor suppressors (inhibiting malignant potential) or oncogenes (activating malignant potential). Researchers first identified this new paradigm of molecular oncology in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Understanding the roles of miRNAs and other ncRNAs in leukemic cells is not only uncovering a new layer of gene regulation but also providing new markers for improved diagnosis and prognosis, as well as novel therapeutic options for CLL patients. Herein we focus on the roles of miRNAs and ultraconserved ncRNA genes in CLL, highlighting what is already known about their function, proposing a novel model of CLL predisposition and progression, and describing the challenges for the near future.","http://ashpublications.org/blood/article-pdf/114/23/4761/1319150/zh804809004761.pdf",""

It is not clear, however, how high levels of fiber affect mineral balance. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a randomized crossover study, 13 patients with type 2 diabetes were fed a high-fiber (50 g total and 25 g soluble fiber) and a moderate-fiber (24 g total and 8 g soluble fiber) diet of the same energy, macronutrient, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus content for 6 weeks each. Intestinal calcium absorption was determined by fecal recovery of 47Ca. Stool weight and mineral content were assessed during 3 days, and 24-h urinary mineral content and serum chemistry were assessed over 5 days at the end of each phase. The results were compared by repeated-measures ANOVA. RESULTS: Compared with the moderate-fiber diet, the high-fiber diet increased stool weight (165 ± 53 vs. 216 ± 63 g/day, P = 0.02) and reduced 24-h urinary calcium (3.3 ± 1.7 vs. 2.4 ± 1.2 mmol/day, P = 0.003) and phosphorus (29.2 ± 5.5 vs. 26.0 ± 3.2 mmol/day, P = 0.003) excretion and serum calcium concentration (2.33 ± 0.06 vs. 2.29 ± 0.07 mmol/l, P = 0.04). Calcium absorption, stool calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus content and serum phosphorus concentration were not significantly different with the two diets. CONCLUSIONS: A high-fiber diet rich in soluble fiber has a small impact on calcium and phosphorus balance in subjects with type 2 diabetes. It may be prudent to ensure adequate intake of calcium and other minerals in individuals consuming a high-fiber diet.","https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/32/6/990/603338/zdc00609000990.pdf",""

Granulysin is expressed by cytotoxic T cells (CTL) and is strongly lytic against susceptible and drug resistant strains of M. tuberculosis. We hypothesized that the reduced CTL activity observed following HIV infection may, in part, be due to suppression of granulysin. We and others have shown that granulysin expression is regulated by common γc cytokines IL-2, IL-15 and IL-21. We used an in vitro model, in which we infected PBMC from healthy donors with HIV. We found that induction of granulysin in CD8+ T cells following stimulation with IL-2, IL-15 or IL-21 was reduced in PBMC infected with HIV. Moreover, we observed that phosphorylation of STAT5, a downstream signaling molecule crucial for the induction of granulysin by IL-2 and IL-15 was also reduced by HIV infection. In an antigen-specific memory response, using PBMC from PPD+ donors, we found that expression of granulysin by memory CD8+ T cells following PPD stimulation was inhibited in HIV-infected PBMC. Our results suggest that suppression of granulysin in response to γc cytokines and specific TB antigen by HIV may be one mechanism for the increased susceptibility of HIV+ patients to TB infection and could represent an important avenue for immune intervention.","https://journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article/182/1_Supplement/128.26/44903/HIV-infection-inhibits-granulysin-expression-by",""

M2aMφ and M2cMφ appeared 1 to 4 days after burn injury, while M2bMφ appeared in mice 1 to 3 weeks after burn injury. In this study, how M2bMφ with suppressor cell activities are prolonged is examined. M2bMφ were peritoneal Mφ isolated from burned BALB/c mice (25% TBSA, 3rd degree flame burn) using biotin-conjugated anti-mouse F4/80 mAb and streptavidin magnetic beads. M2bMφ (1 x 106 cells/ml) isolated from mice 16 days after burn injury were cultured under frequent medium changes (every 12 hrs for 3 days). As a control, the same M2bMφ preparation was cultured for 3 days without any medium changes. Mφ harvested were assayed for LIGHT mRNA by RT-PCR. Also, obtained Mφ were cultured an additional 120 hrs and culture fluids harvested were assayed for CCL1 using ELISA. LIGHT mRNA and CCL1 were typical biomarkers for M2bMφ. In the results, M2bMφ cultured for 3 days without any medium changes expressed LIGHT mRNA. However, this mRNA was not expressed by M2bMφ cultured with frequent medium changes. CCL1 was detected in the culture fluids of M2bMφ that had been previously cultured without any medium changes. When M2bMφ were cultured for 3 days under the frequent medium changes, the ability of these cells to produce CCL1 was reduced by 70%.

In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), two ectoapyrases, AtAPY1 and AtAPY2, have been implicated as key modulators of growth. In fibers of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), transcript levels for GhAPY1 and GhAPY2, two closely related ectoapyrases that have high sequence similarity to AtAPY1 and AtAPY2, are up-regulated when fibers enter their rapid growth phase. In an ovule culture system, fibers release ATP as they grow, and when their ectoapyrase activity is blocked by the addition of polyclonal anti-apyrase antibodies or by two different small molecule inhibitors, the medium ATP level rises and fiber growth is suppressed. High concentrations of the poorly hydrolyzable nucleotides ATPγS and ADPβS applied to the medium inhibit fiber growth, and low concentrations of them stimulate growth, but treatment with adenosine 5′-O-thiomonophosphate causes no change in the growth rate. Both the inhibition and stimulation of growth by applied nucleotides can be blocked by an antagonist that blocks purinoceptors in animal cells, and by adenosine. Treatment of cotton ovule cultures with ATPγS induces increased levels of ethylene, and two ethylene antagonists, aminovinylglycine and silver nitrate, block both the growth stimulatory and growth inhibitory effects of applied nucleotides. In addition, the ethylene precursor, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, lowers the concentration of nucleotide needed to promote fiber growth. These data indicate that ectoapyrases and extracellular nucleotides play a significant role in regulating cotton fiber growth and that ethylene is a likely downstream component of the signaling pathway.","http://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-pdf/152/2/1073/37116205/plphys_v152_2_1073.pdf",""

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Apoptosis, albuminuria, ROS generation, NADPH superoxide generation, CYP4A and Nox protein expression, and mRNA levels were measured in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: Exposure of mouse podocytes to high glucose resulted in apoptosis, with approximately one-third of the cells being apoptotic by 72 h. High-glucose treatment increased ROS generation and was associated with sequential upregulation of CYP4A and an increase in 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) and Nox oxidases. This is consistent with the observation of delayed induction of NADPH oxidase activity by high glucose. The effects of high glucose on NADPH oxidase activity, Nox proteins and mRNA expression, and apoptosis were blocked by N-hydroxy-N′-(4-butyl-2-methylphenol) formamidine (HET0016), an inhibitor of CYP4A, and were mimicked by 20-HETE. CYP4A and Nox oxidase expression was upregulated in glomeruli of type 1 diabetic OVE26 mice. Treatment of OVE26 mice with HET0016 decreased NADPH oxidase activity and Nox1 and Nox4 protein expression and ameliorated apoptosis and albuminuria. CONCLUSIONS: Generation of ROS by CYP4A monooxygenases, 20-HETE, and Nox oxidases is involved in podocyte apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of selected cytochrome P450 isoforms prevented podocyte apoptosis and reduced proteinuria in diabetes.","https://journals.org/diabetes/diabetes/article-pdf/58/5/1201/392833/zdb00509001201.pdf",""

There is limited information comparing the toxicity of the 2 paroxetine formulations. Objective:: To compare the toxicity and management of paroxetine IR and paroxetine CR ingestions reported to poison control centers. Methods:: Cases of ingestion of paroxetine that were reported to Texas poison control centers between 2002 and 2008, in which the final medical outcome and dose were known, were retrospectively reviewed. The rates for selected variables were determined for paroxetine IR and paroxetine CR and comparisons between the 2 were made by calculating the ratio of the drug's CR rate to the IR rate and 95% confidence interval. Compliance with simplified algorithms of triage management guidelines was determined for both formulations. Results:: Included in the analysis were 405 cases of paroxetine IR ingestion and 169 cases of paroxetine CR ingestion for which a reported dose and final medical outcome were known. There were no statistically significant differences between the paroxetine CR and paroxetine IR formulations with respect to serious medical outcomes (ratio 0.69, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.31), self-harm or malicious intent (ratio 0.82, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.12), or referral to a healthcare facility (ratio 1.18, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.83). The rate of compliance with the triage algorithm for cases not already en route to or at a healthcare facility when the poison control center was contacted was 87% for paroxetine IR and 89% for paroxetine CR. Conclusions:: The toxicity and management of paroxetine IR and paroxetine CR ingestions reported to Texas poison control centers were similar after adjusting for differences in dosage.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/875512250902500305",""

Also, these burned patients are shown to be carriers of CCL2-producing PMN (PMN-II). Neither M2bMonocytes or PMN-II has been demonstrated in peripheral blood of healthy donors. In this study, the role of PMN-II on the conversion of naive monocytes to M2bMonocytes was investigated. PMN-II were induced from immuature PMN after stimulation with 0.0075% SAC and 10-6 M terubutaline. Immature PMN were obtained from peripheral blood of healthy volunteers 3 hrs after 1-hr of programmed exercise, as previously described. PMN-II (upper chamber) were transwell-cultured with naive monocytes (syngeneic to PMN-II, lower chamber) for 24 hrs. Cells harvested from the lower chamber were re-cultured for 24 hrs for the production of CCL1 (a biomarker of M2bMonocytes), and culture fluids obtained were assayed for CCL1 by ELISA. Naive monocytes did not produce CCL1 even when they were transwell-cultured with healthy donor PMN (normal PMN). However, CCL1 was detected in culture fluids of naive monocytes that were previously cultured with PMN-II. Anti-CCL2 mAb inhibited the appearance of M2bMonocytes in transwell-cultures between naive monocytes and PMN-II. Also, M2bMonocytes were generated from naive monocytes after they were cultured with recombinant CCL2. These results indicate that PMN-II, or CCL2 produced by PMN-II, play an important role on the generation of M2bMonocytes commonly demonstrated in burn patient peripheral blood.

We used Caenorhabditis elegans mutants, RNA interference (RNAi), and the chemical 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FUDR) to test the hypothesis that a reduction in progeny would increase oxygen deprivation (anoxia) survival. In the hermaphrodite gonad, germ line processes such as spermatogenesis and oogenesis can be simultaneously as well as independently disrupted by genetic mutations. We analyzed genetic mutants [ glp-1(q158), glp-4(bn2ts), plc-1(rx1), ksr-1(ku68), fog-2(q71), fem-3(q20), spe-9(hc52ts), fer-15(hc15ts)] with reduced progeny production due to various reproductive defects. Furthermore, we used RNAi to inhibit the function of gene products in the RTK/Ras/MAPK signaling pathway, which is known to be involved in a variety of developmental processes including gonad function. We determined that reduced progeny production or complete sterility enhanced anoxia survival except in the case of sterile hermaphrodites [ spe-9(hc52ts), fer-15(hc15ts)] undergoing oocyte maturation and ovulation as exhibited by the presence of laid unfertilized oocytes. Furthermore, the fog-2(q71) long-term anoxia survival phenotype was suppressed when oocyte maturation and ovulation were induced by mating with males that have functional or nonfunctional sperm. The mutants with a reduced progeny production survive long-term anoxia in a daf-16- and hif-1-independent manner. Finally, we determined that wild-type males were able to survive long-term anoxia in a daf-16-independent manner. Together, these results suggest that the insulin signaling pathway is not the only mechanism to survive oxygen deprivation and that altering gonad function, in particular oocyte maturation and ovulation, leads to a physiological state conducive for oxygen deprivation survival.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/physiolgenomics.90278.2008",""

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally. Aberrant expression of miRNAs has been implicated in various disease processes. Recent evidence indicates that miRNAs are central to immune function and play a role in T cell responsiveness to antigen stimulation. We hypothesized that certain miRNAs would be differentially expressed in mice with EAE, and that these miRNAs represent critical mediators of autoimmune disease pathology. We utilized microarray technology, followed by PCR verification, to evaluate miRNA expression level at varying times during the EAE disease course. RNA was obtained from the lymph nodes and spleen during the acute and effector phases of EAE, and compared to animals receiving adjuvant alone. We found that several miRNAs are up- or downregulated during EAE and expression is temporally distinct. These data indicate that miRNAs represent a critical component of EAE pathology, and may be useful therapeutic targets or biomarkers in MS and other autoimmune diseases.

In the present study, we assessed the utility of cereal EST-SSRs in ryegrass ( Lolium spp.). A total of 165 cereal EST-SSRs were tested; a high rate of transferability (57%) and polymorphism (67% of functional EST-SSRs) was demonstrated between cereals and ryegrass. A total of 46 segregating loci derived from 37 EST-SSRs were mapped on an existing ryegrass genetic map.

Sequences of ryegrass amplicons generated by randomly selected 16 EST-SSRs were aligned with reference sequences of cereal EST-SSRs. The SSR motifs and repeat lengths of the cereal EST-SSR markers were different from the majority of ryegrass amplicons. Furthermore, a majority of EST-SSRs amplified different flanking sequences of SSRs in ryegrass than the original cereal sequences.

Reliability was examined for both quantitative-based and qualitative judgment-based retrospective teacher behavior ratings. Quantitative-based behavior ratings focused primarily on frequency and duration scales, whereas qualitative-based behavior ratings focused on topography and intensity scales. Findings indicated that reliability can be adequately achieved, although there is variability depending on the type of scale.

To date, all functions attributed to C4BP have been delineated in vitro. To evaluate functions of C4BP in vivo, we have generated C4bBP deficient mice by targeted disruption of mouse C4BP alpha gene. As expected, the C4bBP-/- serum exhibited significant increased hemolytic activity, and C3 deposition on M. catarrhalis was significantly increased. C4BP-/- mice and C4BP+/+ mice were injected i.p. with M catarrhalis to determine if elevated C3 deposition in C4BP-/- sera would correspond to increased killing of M. catarrhalis in vivo. Contrary to our expectation, the absence of C4BP did not impact the clearance (CFUs) of M.catarrhalis. To investigate if the absence of C4BP would impair the immune response to T-dependent Ags, mice were immunized with DNP-OVA. In contrast to the prediction of Brodeur et al (Immunity 2003), C4bBP-/- mice produced DNP specific IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies at similar levels as did C4bBP+/+ mice. Collectively, these studies provide evidence for the importance of C4BP in regulating complement activation and that C3 deposition on M. catarrhalis is impaired by binding C4BP. However, the absence of C4BP did not cause increased killing of M. catarrhalis in vivo, suggesting that other mechanisms of bacterial clearance compensate for the absence of C4BP. Moreover, C4BP as a major modulator of the antibody response was not supported in these studies, suggesting species dependent differences in C4BP biological functions.","https://journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article/182/1_Supplement/134.92/45077/Generation-of-C4-Binding-Protein-Deficient-Mice",""

Previously, we reported that DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) resulting from nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) deficiency induce apoptosis and, when combined with p53 deficiency, progressed rapidly into lymphomagenesis in mice. Combination of NHEJ deficiency with a hypomorphic mutation, p53R172P, leads to the abrogation of apoptosis, upregulation of p21, and senescence in precursor lymphocytes. This was sufficient to prevent tumorigenesis. However, these mutant mice succumb to severe diabetes and die at an early age. The aim of this study was to determine the pathogenesis of diabetes in these mutant mice. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the morphology of the pancreatic islets and the function, proliferation rate, and senescence of β-cells. We also profiled DNA damage and p53 and p21 expression in the pancreas. RESULTS: NHEJ-p53R172P mutant mice succumb to diabetes at 3–5 months of age. These mice show a progressive decrease in pancreatic islet mass that is independent of apoptosis and innate immunity. We observed an accumulation of DNA damage, accompanied with increased levels of p53 and p21, a significant decrease in β-cell proliferation, and cellular senescence in the mutant pancreatic islets. CONCLUSIONS: Combined DSBs with an absence of p53-dependent apoptosis activate p53-dependent senescence, which leads to a diminished β-cell self-replication, massive depletion of the pancreatic islets, and severe diabetes. This is a model that connects impaired DNA repair and accumulative DNA damage, a common phenotype in aging individuals, to the onset of diabetes.","https://journals.org/diabetes/diabetes/article-pdf/59/1/135/664145/zdb00110000135.pdf",""

We used Caenorhabditis elegans mutants, RNA interference (RNAi), and the chemical 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FUDR) to test the hypothesis that a reduction in progeny would increase oxygen deprivation (anoxia) survival. In the hermaphrodite gonad, germ line processes such as spermatogenesis and oogenesis can be simultaneously as well as independently disrupted by genetic mutations. We analyzed genetic mutants [ glp-1(q158), glp-4(bn2ts), plc-1(rx1), ksr-1(ku68), fog-2(q71), fem-3(q20), spe-9(hc52ts), fer-15(hc15ts)] with reduced progeny production due to various reproductive defects. Furthermore, we used RNAi to inhibit the function of gene products in the RTK/Ras/MAPK signaling pathway, which is known to be involved in a variety of developmental processes including gonad function. We determined that reduced progeny production or complete sterility enhanced anoxia survival except in the case of sterile hermaphrodites [ spe-9(hc52ts), fer-15(hc15ts)] undergoing oocyte maturation and ovulation as exhibited by the presence of laid unfertilized oocytes. Furthermore, the fog-2(q71) long-term anoxia survival phenotype was suppressed when oocyte maturation and ovulation were induced by mating with males that have functional or nonfunctional sperm. The mutants with a reduced progeny production survive long-term anoxia in a daf-16- and hif-1-independent manner. Finally, we determined that wild-type males were able to survive long-term anoxia in a daf-16-independent manner. Together, these results suggest that the insulin signaling pathway is not the only mechanism to survive oxygen deprivation and that altering gonad function, in particular oocyte maturation and ovulation, leads to a physiological state conducive for oxygen deprivation survival.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/physiolgenomics.90278.2008",""

This definition leads to data requirements and specific direct-inverse algorithms, which differ with all current linear and nonlinear approaches, and is immediately relevant for target identification and inversion in an elastic earth. Common practice typically starts with a direct forward or modeling expression and seeks to solve a forward equation in an inverse sense. Attempting to solve a direct forward problem in an inverse sense is not the same as solving an inverse problem directly. Distinctions include differences in algorithms, in the need for a priori information, and in data requirements. The simplest and most accessible examples are the direct-inversion tasks, derived from the inverse scattering series (ISS), for the removal of free-surface and internal multiples. The ISS multiple-removal algorithms require no subsurface information, and they are independent of earth model type. A direct forward method solved in an inverse sense, for modeling and subtracting multiples, would require accurate knowledge of every detail of the subsurface the multiple has experienced. In addition, it requires a different modeling and subtraction algorithm for each different earth-model type. The ISS methods for direct removal of multiples are not a forward problem solved in an inverse sense. Similarly, the direct elastic inversion provided by the ISS is not a modeling formula for PP data solved in an inverse sense. Direct elastic inversion calls for [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], … data, for direct linear and nonlinear estimates of changes in mechanical properties. In practice, a judicious combination of direct and indirect methods are called upon for effective field data application.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/1.3256286",""

To date, there have been limited studies on the behavior of plates and plate anchors under three-dimensional loading conditions. This paper summarizes the results of analytical and experimental studies for out-of-plane loading on plate anchors in normally consolidated clays. A simplified analytical model describing the combination of forces and moments that would cause a square or rectangular bearing plate to move (yield) is developed based on three-dimensional finite element modeling. This model provides an analytical expression of a multi-axial yield interaction surface for the bearing plate that includes all six degrees of freedom. A series of experimental pull-out tests on square and rectangular bearing plates with a variety of different load geometries provides validation to the analytical model. A demonstration is presented at the end of the paper where the behavior of a flat bearing plate attachd to a thin shank is predicted and then tested under normal and out-of-plane loading. This demonstration illustrates how the fundamental work completed thus far can subsequently be used to predict the performance of actual anchors.","http://onepetro.org/OTCONF/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.4043/20115-MS/1759572/otc-20115-ms.pdf",""

Some other dietary fats contain lower levels of phytol, which is readily converted to phytanic acid after absorption. Phytanic acid is a peroxisome proliferator binding the nuclear transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) to induce expression of genes encoding enzymes of fatty acid oxidation in peroxisomes and mitochondria. Administration of dietary phytol (0.5% or 1%) to normal mice for twelve to eighteen days caused consistent PPARα-mediated responses, such as lower body weights, higher liver weights, peroxisome proliferation, increased catalase expression, and hepatocellular hypertrophy and hyperplasia. Female mice fed 0.5% phytol and male and female mice fed 1% phytol exhibited midzonal hepatocellular necrosis, periportal hepatocellular fatty vacuolation, and corresponding increases in liver levels of the phytol metabolites phytanic acid and pristanic acid. Hepatic expression of sterol carrier protein-x (SCP-x) was five- to twelve-fold lower in female mice than in male mice. These results suggest that phytol may cause selective midzonal hepatocellular necrosis in mice, an uncommon pattern of hepatotoxic injury, and that the greater susceptibility of female mice may reflect a lower capacity to oxidize phytanic acid because of their intrinsically lower hepatic expression of SCP-x.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0192623308330789",""

Most remarkably, the altitude extent of the ionosphere is significantly smaller than our present reference models would predict for these levels of solar activity.

Using the receiver operating characteristic curve to derive a measure for system performance, we maximize system value by balancing system benefits with maintenance costs. The problem is cast as an optimal control model in which the goal is to choose the timing and extent of maintenance that must be expended to maximize system value. We find that the optimal solution usually possesses a steady-state component. The maintenance problem is also solved as a discrete, impulse control problem, as well as one where maintenance effort has a nonlinear impact on system performance.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0908",""

In order to enable the use of such precursors, the authors investigated a method by which one can directly inject these liquids as microdroplets into low pressure PECVD environments. The solvent evaporates first leaving behind the desired precursor in the gas/plasma. The plasma dissociates the vapor and causes the deposition of a composite film (from precursor, solvent, and plasma gas). The authors made preliminary tests using Fe nanoparticles in hexane and were able to incorporate over 4% Fe in the resulting thin films. In addition, the authors simulated the process. The time required for a droplet to fully evaporate is a function of the background pressure, initial liquid temperature, droplet-vapor interactions, and initial droplet size. A typical evaporation time for a 50μm diameter droplet of hexane is ∼3s without plasma at 100mTorr. The presence of plasma can decrease the evaporation time by more than an order of magnitude. In addition, the model predicts that the temperature of the injected droplet first decreases by evaporative cooling (to ∼180K for hexane); however, once the solvent has fully evaporated/sublimated, the plasma heats any remaining solute. As a result the solute temperature can first fall to 180K, then rise to nearly 750K in less than 1s.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jva/article-pdf/27/2/342/16171779/342_1_online.pdf",""

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: With two parallel approaches—a fat body–specific green fluorescent protein enhancer trap screen in D. melanogaster and expression profiling of developing murine fat tissues—we identified Atf4 as expressed in invertebrate and vertebrate metabolic tissues. We assessed the functional relevance of the evolutionarily conserved expression by analyzing Atf4 mutant flies and Atf4 mutant mice for possible metabolic phenotypes. RESULTS: Flies with insertions at the Atf4 locus have reduced fat content, increased starvation sensitivity, and lower levels of circulating carbohydrate. Atf4 null mice are also lean, and they resist age-related and diet-induced obesity. Atf4 null mice have increased energy expenditure potentially accounting for the lean phenotype. Atf4 null mice are hypoglycemic, even before substantial changes in fat content, indicating that Atf4 regulates mammalian carbohydrate metabolism. In addition, the Atf4 mutation blunts diet-induced diabetes as well as hyperlipidemia and hepatosteatosis. Several aspects of the Atf4 mutant phenotype resemble mice with mutations in components of the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway. Consistent with the phenotypic similarities, Atf4 null mice have reduced expression of genes that regulate intracellular amino acid concentrations and lower intracellular concentration of amino acids, a key TOR input. Further, Atf4 mutants have reduced S6K activity in liver and adipose tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Atf4 regulates age-related and diet-induced obesity as well as glucose homeostasis in mammals and has conserved metabolic functions in flies.","https://journals.org/diabetes/diabetes/article-pdf/58/11/2565/392567/zdb01109002565.pdf",""

However, while initially highly efficacious in inducing remission of MS, GCs eventually loose efficacy and overall do not prevent progression of the disease. GCs have the unique property of inducing the release of Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a pro-inflammatory cytokine with broad effects on the immune response. Thus, we hypothesized that MIF could play an important role in promoting disease by its unique ability to counter-regulate the immunosuppressive effects of GCs. Testing this question, we found that treatment of MIF knockout mice (KO) with GCs was substantially more efficacious as compared with GC-treatment of Wt mice and resulted in a substantial delay in disease onset and severity of EAE. Histological and immunofluorescence studies showed that inflammatory infiltrates were dramatically reduced in MIF KO mice. Furthermore, thymus and spleen cells from MIF KO mice showed higher extend of apoptosis upon incubation with GCs as compared with Wt mice. The results suggest that the blockade of MIF in combination with GC administration could be a promising strategy for the treatment of MS.

This complex has been shown to have a role in pre‐messenger RNA splicing from yeast to humans; however, more recent studies have described a function for this complex in the cellular response to DNA damage. Here, we show that Cdc5L interacts physically with the cell‐cycle checkpoint kinase ataxia‐telangiectasia and Rad3‐related (ATR). Depletion of Cdc5L by RNA‐mediated interference methods results in a defective S‐phase cell‐cycle checkpoint and cellular sensitivity in response to replication‐fork blocking agents. Furthermore, we show that Cdc5L is required for the activation of downstream effectors or mediators of ATR checkpoint function such as checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1), cell cycle checkpoint protein Rad 17 (Rad17) and Fanconi anaemia complementation group D2 protein (FancD2). In addition, we have mapped the ATR‐binding region in Cdc5L and show that a deletion mutant that is unable to interact with ATR is defective in the rescue of the checkpoint deficiency in Cdc5L‐depleted cells. These findings show a new function for Cdc5L in the regulation of the ATR‐mediated cell‐cycle checkpoint in response to genotoxic agents.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1038/embor.2009.122",""

A dimensionless coordinate system is used which reduces the numbers of computations and hence simplifies the stress analysis. All components of the stress distribution, both in the film and in the substrate, including the normal stress along the growth direction as well as in-plane normal stresses and shear stresses are fully investigated. This information about the stress distribution provides insight into understanding and controlling the AlN single crystal growth by the sublimation technique. The normal stress in the film at the interface along the growth direction and the shear stresses are zero except at the edges, whereas in-plane stresses are nonzero. The in-plane stresses are compressive when TaC and NbC substrates are used. A small compressive stress might be beneficial in prohibiting crack growth in the film. The compressive stress in the AlN is lower for the TaC substrate than that for the NbC. Tensile in-plane stresses are formed in the AlN for 6H-SiC, BN, and W substrates. This tensile stress in the film is detrimental as it will assist in the crack growth. The stress concentration at the edges of the AlN film at the interface is compressive in nature when TaC and NbC are used as a substrate. This causes the film to bend downward (i.e., convex shape) and assist it to adhere to the substrate. The AlN film curves upward or in a concave shape when SiC, BN, and W substrates are used since the stress concentration at the edges of the AlN film is tensile at the interface and this may cause detachment of the film from the substrate.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.3075840/14949566/033521_1_online.pdf",""

For upstream industry, it can be used in drilling operation, hydraulic fracturing, acidizing treatments, and sand control. The widespread applications of viscoelastic surfactants (VES) originate from the intrinsic duality in their molecular characteristics. Through many years of experience, various classes of VES have been introduced including cationic, zwitterionic (betaine) and especially, alkylamine oxide surfactants which represent a promising and well-characterized class of responsive fluid. These materials have considerable influence on acid placement in oil well stimulation. As the acid reacts with carbonate minerals in particular, the pH rises and the concentration of calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, or both will increase. The presence of salts and the increase in pH will cause the surfactant molecules to form long rod-like micelles. The behavior of wormlike micelles have drawn considerable interest over the past two decades, both from a theoretical viewpoint as well as for industrial and technological applications, the range of which keeps expanding.","https://onepetro.org/SPEOCC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/121727-MS/2716549/spe-121727-ms.pdf",""

Speech corrupted at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels (−5 and 0dB) using different types of maskers is synthesized by this algorithm and presented to normal-hearing listeners for identification.

Local stem cell application has recently been suggested as a possible novel therapy. In the present study we evaluated the potential of a silk fibroin-chitosan (SFCS) scaffold serving as a delivery vehicle for human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) in a murine soft tissue injury model. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled ASCs were seeded on SFCS scaffolds at a density of 1 × 105 ASCs per cm2 for 48 hours and then suture-inlaid to a 6-mm, full-thickness skin defect in 6-week-old male athymic mice. Wound healing was tracked for 2 weeks by planimetry. Histology was evaluated at 2 and 4 weeks. Our data show that the extent of wound closure was significantly enhanced in the ASC-SFCS group versus SFCS and no-graft controls at postoperative day 8 (90% ± 3% closure vs. 75% ± 11% and 55% ± 17%, respectively). Microvessel density at wound bed biopsy sites from 2 weeks postoperative was significantly higher in the ASC-SFCS group versus SFCS alone (7.5 ± 1.1 vs. 5.1 ± 1.0 vessels per high-power field). Engrafted stem cells were positive for the fibroblastic marker heat shock protein 47, smooth muscle actin, and von Willebrand factor at both 2 and 4 weeks.

In conclusion, human adipose-derived stem cells seeded on a silk fibroin-chitosan scaffold enhance wound healing and show differentiation into fibrovascular, endothelial, and epithelial components of restored tissue.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1634/stemcells.2008-0178",""

While its biosynthesis is well understood, its fate, once in circulation, is less well established. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Here, we examine the half-life of adiponectin in circulation by tracking fluorescently labeled recombinant adiponectin in the circulation, following it to its final destination in the hepatocyte. RESULTS: Despite its abundant presence in plasma, adiponectin is cleared rapidly with a half-life of ∼75 min. A more bioactive version carrying a mutation at cysteine 39 is cleared within minutes. Even though steady-state levels of adiponectin differ between male and female mice, we failed to detect any differences in clearance rates, suggesting that differences in plasma are mostly due to differential production rates. In a metabolically challenged state (high-fat diet exposure or in an ob/ob background), adiponectin levels are reduced in plasma and clearance is significantly prolonged, reflecting a dramatic drop in adiponectin production levels. CONCLUSIONS: Combined, these results show a surprisingly rapid turnover of adiponectin with multiple fat pads contributing to the plasma levels of adiponectin and clearance mediated primarily by the liver. It is surprising that despite high-level production and rapid clearance, plasma levels of adiponectin remain remarkably constant.","https://journals.org/diabetes/diabetes/article-pdf/58/9/1961/393812/zdb00909001961.pdf",""

The surface topography of the fracture faces after acid injection is rarely investigated and, therefore, poorly described. The concept of average fracture width has been used in the fracture conductivity models to predict fracture conductivity in acid fracturing. Previous study showed that the characterization of fracture faces after acid etching plays an important role in fracture conductivity. If channels and wormholes are created, fracture conductivity cannot be described by the conventional model. For more evenly distributed etching, surface topography characteristic strongly influences the resulting conductivity. With a surface profilometer, a laser device that accurately measures the height of the asperities on the rock surface, we obtain a digital image that can be used to quantitatively characterize the etched surface topography after acidizing. Using this data we are able to define the channel geometry and etching patterns as numerical values. The distribution of these numerical values is later converted and analyzed as surface texture parameters and standard statistical variables for rough surface characterization. When two roughness parameters of each corresponding fracture surface are superposed, the fracture conductivity can be related to the statistical parameters of etching.","https://onepetro.org/SPEHFTC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/119743-MS/2706858/spe-119743-ms.pdf",""

Th cell subset called T follicular helper (TFH) cells are recently found to be present in germinal centers and are characterized by their expression of chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 5 (CXCR5). Despite their potential importance in humoral immunity, the developmental regulation of TFH cells and their relationship with other Th subsets is unclear. We found that mouse TFH cells have a divergent gene expression profile from Th1, Th2 cells, and in vivo developed independently of these cell lineages. TFH cell generation was regulated by ICOS liagand expressed on B cells and was dependent on interleukin (IL)-21, IL-6 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Although TFH cells shared IL-21 expression with Th17 cells, they did not express IL-17, IL-17F, IL-22. Moreover, differentiation of TFH cells did not require TGFβ or Th17-specific orphan nuclear receptors RORα?and RORγ in vivo. Most importantly, T cells activated in vitro in the presence of IL-21 but without TGFβ signaling preferentially acquired TFH gene expression and functioned to promote humoral immunity in vivo. Our data indicate that TFH cells are distinct in their gene expression, developmental regulation and immune function from Th1, Th2 or Th17 lineages.","https://journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article/182/1_Supplement/90.10/46422/Developmental-requirements-of-T-follicular-helper",""

Paired temperature and visual images show that zones with specific coloration occur within distinct temperature ranges. Unlike previous studies where maximum, minimum, and optimal temperatures for microorganisms are based on isothermally‐controlled laboratory cultures, thermal imaging allows for mapping thousands of temperature values in a natural setting.

The applied homogeneous external magnetic field is redistributed in the superconducting film due to the high magnetic permeability of iron. This results in alternating parallel stripes of regions of low and high magnetic field. Thus the values of second critical field HC2 and critical current density are also much higher for current parallel to the magnetic stripes than in a control superconducting film without any magnetic field modulation. For the current perpendicular to the magnetic stripes, the superconductor behaves like an inhomogeneous resistor with regions of low and higher TC in series. Thus, the critical current IC for the perpendicular case is much less than either the control film or the case for current parallel to the magnetic sheets. These results demonstrate that it is possible to strongly increase IC and HC2 by simple redirection of magnetic flux with a soft magnetic microstructure.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.3076517/15040110/07e324_1_online.pdf",""

Ultimate hydrocarbon recoveries larger than those currently achieved are possible, especially when sensors are used with advanced recovery methods. However, it is often unclear if the incremental recovery justifies the cost of installing the sensors. This paper proposes a method for estimating incremental values attributable to real-time sensors and provides a demonstration of the method for several production technologies and reservoir settings. The method offers a transparent and practical means of making value of information (VOI) computations to be implemented readily by project teams. An additional benefit of this method is that the process of specifying the inputs to the analysis facilitates a systematic discussion of strengths and weaknesses, and builds consensus regarding assumptions. The method is applied to four scenarios developed by a panel of industry experts to represent generic, but yet realistic reservoirs. The results for these scenarios indicate the value of sensors depends on the market price for product and the type of reservoir and production technology. The greatest absolute economic value for the use of sensors is obtained for a deepwater reservoir, while the greatest economic value per equivalent barrel of oil produced is obtained for a mature onshore reservoir. These expected economic values are intended to be compared to the cost required to implement the sensors to assess whether or not there is an expected net benefit.","https://onepetro.org/REE/article-pdf/12/04/618/2530866/spe-109628-pa.pdf",""

However, the MCMC usually requires many flow and transport simulations in evaluating the posterior distribution and can be computationally expensive for fine‐scale geological models. We propose a methodology that combines coarse‐ and fine‐scale information to improve the efficiency of MCMC methods. The proposed method employs off‐line computations for modeling the relation between coarse‐ and fine‐scale error responses. This relation is modeled using nonlinear functions with prescribed error precisions which are used in efficient sampling within the MCMC framework. We propose a two‐stage MCMC where inexpensive coarse‐scale simulations are performed to determine whether or not to run the fine‐scale (resolved) simulations. The latter is determined on the basis of a statistical model developed off line. The proposed method is an extension of the approaches considered earlier where linear relations are used for modeling the response between coarse‐scale and fine‐scale models. The approach considered here does not rely on the proximity of approximate and resolved models and can employ much coarser and more inexpensive models to guide the fine‐scale simulations. Numerical results for three‐phase flow and transport demonstrate the advantages, efficiency, and utility of the method for uncertainty assessment in the history matching.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2008WR007039",""

Furthermore, Cx-43 promoter activity was significantly inhibited in PAR-1–silenced cells, suggesting that PAR-1 regulates Cx-43 at the transcriptional level. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies showed a reduction in the binding of SP-1 and AP-1 transcription factors to the promoter of Cx-43. Both transcription factors have been shown previously to be required for maximal Cx-43 promoter activity. These results were corroborated by mutating the AP-1 and SP-1 binding sites resulting in decreased Cx-43 promoter activity in PAR-1–positive cells. Moreover, as Cx-43 has been shown to facilitate arrest of circulating tumor cells at the vascular endothelium, melanoma cell attachment to endothelial cells was significantly decreased in PAR-1–silenced cells, with this effect being abrogated after PAR-1 rescue. Herein, we report that up-regulation of PAR-1 expression, seen in melanoma progression, mediates high levels of Cx-43 expression. As both SP-1 and AP-1 transcription factors act as positive regulators of Cx-43, our data provide a novel mechanism for the regulation of Cx-43 expression by PAR-1. Indeed, Cx-43 expression was restored following PAR-1 rescue in PAR-1–silenced cells. Taken together, our data support the tumor promoting function of Cx-43 in melanoma.

In addition to the appropriate surfactant concentration, 15 wt% HCl was used. A key parameter such as flow rate, affects the behavior of the gelling material significantly. Therefore to capture that effect, flow rates chosen to be representative ranged between 5 and 15 cm3/min. A further analysis included is the effluent concentration for the mineral composition mainly Ca++.

Negligible work, however, has been devoted to studying the effects of oil-based mud(OBM)-filtrate invasion on well logs and the corresponding impact on the estimation of petrophysical properties. We quantitatively compare the effects of WBM- and OBM-filtrate invasion on borehole resistivity measurements. We simulate the process of mud-filtrate invasion into a porous and permeable rock formation assuming 1D radial distributions of fluid saturation and fluid properties while other petrophysical properties remain constant. To simulate the process of mud-filtrate invasion, we calculate a time-dependent flow rate of OBM-filtrate invasion by adapting the available formulation of the physics of WBM-filtrate invasion. This approach includes the dynamically coupled effects of mud-cake growth and multiphase filtrate invasion. Simulations are performed with a commercial adaptive-implicit compositional formulation that enables the quantification of effects caused by additional components of mud-filtrate and native fluids. The formation under analysis is 100% water saturated (base case) andis invaded with a single-component OBM. Subsequently, we perform simulations of WBM filtrate invading the same formation assuming that it is hydrocarbon bearing, and compare the results to those obtained in the presence of OBM. At the end of this process, we invoke Archie’s equation to calculate the radial distribution of electrical resistivity from the simulated radial distributions of water saturation and salt concentration and compare the effects of invasion on borehole resistivity measurements acquired in the presence of OBM and WBM. Simulations confirm that the flow rate of OBM-filtrate invasion remains controlled by the initial mud-cake permeability and formation petrophysical properties, specifically capillary pressure and relative permeability. Moreover, WBM causes radial lengths of invasion 15%–40% larger than those associated with OBM as observed on the radial distributions of electrical resistivity. It is found also that, in general, flow rates of WBM-filtrate invasion are higher than those of OBM-filtrate invasion caused by viscosity contrasts between OBM filtrate and native fluids, which slow down the process of invasion. Such a conclusion is validated by the marginal variability of array-induction resistivity measurements observed in simulations of OBM invasion compared with those of WBM invasion.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/1.3033214",""

Method: A modified reaction time paradigm was used to assess INT and SEQ demands. Specifically, syllable complexity was dependent on syllable structure, whereas sequence complexity involved either repeated or unique syllabi within an utterance. Results: INT execution was slowed when articulating single syllables in the form CCCV compared to simpler CV syllables. Planning unique syllables within a multisyllabic utterance rather than repetitions of the same syllable slowed INT but not SEQ. Conclusions: The INT speech motor programming process, important for mental syllabary access, is sensitive to changes in both syllable structure and the number of unique syllables in an utterance.","http://pubs.asha.org/doi/pdf/10.1044/1092-4388%282009/07-0256%29",""

A problem associated with acidizing is the tendency of the live acid or spend acid to form sludge which can reduce the effectiveness of the treatment or plug the formation or production equipments. Formation of sludge results from precipitation of insoluble materials upon interaction with acid. Presence of cations such as ferric will enhance the aggregation process. Emulsion and corrosion are other problems associated with well acidizing and it can impact flow to the wellbore. It has been reported that anionic surfactants can address some of the problems associated with well stimulation and align themselves due to intermolecular attraction or non-covalent bonds to form wormlike micelles. The micelles can be absorbed on the formation or further interact to form a network exhibiting elastic behavior dependent on type of rocks. This increase in viscoelasticity helps in many cases to control fluid placement while acidizing multiple zones with variation in permeability and it also has sufficient properties to suspend and carry the proppant into the fractured zone. Several previous experimental studies highlighted the significant role of counterions in determining the apparent properties of aqueous solutions that contained viscoelastic surfactants. Wormlike micelles are formed by aggregation of amphiphiles. Presence of co-surfactant, additives, salts or appropriate counterions helps promote growth of such micelles. The effect of counterions can be detrimental on the properties of the whole system. Understanding how macroscopic properties depend on intermolecular interactions for complex fluids is the main focus of this study.","https://onepetro.org/SPEOCC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/121722-MS/2716720/spe-121722-ms.pdf",""

To accomplish this goal, 275 college students read a job description for a cashier position and then read 1 of 12 descriptions of an applicant varied by criminal history, qualifications, and race. Participants rate the applicants across dimensions relevant to hiring decisions. Results indicate that applicants with drug possession charges and low qualifications were less likely to be referred for hire. Severity of charges influences employability. Among applicants with a misdemeanor, qualifications increase employability, but qualifications have no influence for applicants with a felony.

Here, we report that SRp20, a cellular splicing factor, controls the early-to-late switch via interactions with A/C-rich RNA elements. An A/C-rich SE4 element regulates the selection of a bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) late-specific splice site, and binding of SRp20 to SE4 suppresses this selection. Expression of late BPV-1 L1 or human papillomavirus (HPV) L1, the major capsid protein, inversely correlates with SRp20 levels in the terminally differentiated keratinocytes. In HPV type 16, a similar SRp20-interacting element also controls the viral early-to-late switch. Keratinocytes in raft cultures, which support L1 expression, make considerably less SRp20 than keratinocytes in monolayer cultures, which do not support L1 expression. Conversely, abundant SRp20 in cancer cells or undifferentiated keratinocytes is important for the expression of the viral early E6 and E7 by promoting the expression of cellular transcription factor SP1 for transactivation of viral early promoters.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.01719-08",""

Loss of functional p53 is correlated with poor prognosis, ER negativity, and resistance to antiestrogen treatment. Previously, we found that p53 genotype was correlated with ER expression and response to tamoxifen in mammary tumors arising in mouse mammary tumor virus–Wnt-1 transgenic mice. These results lead us to hypothesize that p53 may regulate ER expression. To test this, MCF-7 cells were treated with doxorubicin or ionizing radiation, both of which stimulated a 5-fold increase in p53 expression. ER expression was also increased 4-fold over a 24-h time frame. In cells treated with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting p53, expression of both p53 and ER was significantly reduced (&gt;60%) by 24 h. Induction of ER by DNA-damaging agents was p53 dependent as either ionizing radiation or doxorubicin failed to up-regulate ER after treatment with p53-targeting siRNA. To further investigate whether p53 directly regulates transcription of the ER gene promoter, MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with a wild-type (WT) p53 expression vector along with a luciferase reporter containing the proximal promoter of ER. In cells transfected with WT p53, transcription from the ER promoter was increased 8-fold. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that p53 was recruited to the ER promoter along with CARM1, CBP, c-Jun, and Sp1 and that this multifactor complex was formed in a p53-dependent manner. These data show that p53 regulates ER expression through transcriptional control of the ER promoter, accounting for their concordant expression in human breast cancer.

The present study further investigated the role of thromboxane A2 receptor in StAR gene expression and steroidogenesis in testicular Leydig cells. The thromboxane A2 receptor was detected in several Leydig cell lines. Blocking thromboxane A2 binding to the receptor using specific antagonist SQ29548 or BM567 resulted in dose-dependent increases in StAR protein and steroid production in MA-10 mouse Leydig cells. The results were confirmed with Leydig cells isolated from rats. StAR promoter activity and StAR mRNA level in the cells were also increased after the treatments, suggesting an involvement of the thromboxane A2 receptor in StAR gene transcription. Furthermore study indicated that blocking the thromboxane A2 receptor reduced dosage sensitive sex reversal-adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on the X chromosome, gene 1 protein, a transcriptional repressor of StAR gene expression. Specific binding of the antagonists to the receptors on cellular membrane was demonstrated by binding assays using 3H-SQ29548 and binding competition between 3H-SQ29548 and BM567. Whereas SQ29548 enhanced cAMP-induced StAR gene expression, in the absence of cAMP, it was unable to increase StAR protein and steroidogenesis. However, when the receptor was blocked by the antagonist, subthreshold levels of cAMP were able to induce maximal levels of StAR protein expression, suggesting that blocking the thromboxane A2 receptor increase sensitivity of MA-10 cells to cAMP stimulation. Taken together, the results from the present and previous studies suggest an autocrine loop, involving cyclooxygenase-2, thromboxane A synthase, and thromboxane A2 and its receptor, in cyclooxygenase-2-dependent inhibition of StAR gene expression.","http://academic.oup.com/endo/article-pdf/150/7/3267/9007213/endo3267.pdf",""

Gene expression analysis using microarrays revealed that all subclones overexpressed CXCL14, a novel chemokine with undefined function. We further show that CXCL14 expression is up-regulated by ROS through the activator protein-1 signaling pathway and promotes cell motility through elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ by binding to the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor on the endoplasmic reticulum. Abrogation of CXCL14 expression using a decoy approach suppressed cell motility and invasion.

Even though there has been increasing evidence suggesting that LOX-1 may play an important role in chronic inflammation, the role of LOX-1 in acute inflammation and tissue injury remains largely unknown. In our present study, we assessed the role of LOX-1 in a mouse model of endotoxin-induced acute lung injury. We demonstrated that LOX-1 could act directly as a neutrophil adhesion molecule. Importantly, blockade of LOX-1 was able to inhibit neutrophil infiltration into the lung. Furthermore, LOX-1 appears to play an important role in mediating pro-inflammatory signaling. NF-κB activation, ICAM-1 expression and apoptotic signaling induced by endotoxin challenge in the lung were all significantly inhibited by LOX-1 blockade. Collectively, our results indicate that LOX-1 could be a multi-functional pro-inflammatory mediator that may play important role in both the induction and development of acute lung inflammation and injury. Our studies also suggest that LOX-1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target against septic shock.","https://journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article/182/1_Supplement/94.10/45927/LOX-1-is-a-novel-mediator-of-acute-lung",""

Lung alveolar type II and bronchiolar epithelial (Clara) cells secrete surfactant protein A (SP-A), a collectin that is an important component of the pulmonary innate immune system. SP-A binds to the virus, targeting the infectious agent for clearance by host defense mechanisms. We have previously shown that while the steady-state level of SP-A mRNA increases approximately threefold after RSV infection, steady-state levels of cellular and secreted SP-A protein decrease 40–60% in human type II cells in primary culture, suggesting a mechanism where the virus alters components of the innate immune response in infected cells. In these studies, we find that changes in SP-A mRNA and protein levels in RSV-infected NCI-H441 cells (a bronchiolar epithelial cell line) recapitulate the results in SP-A expression observed in primary lung cells. While SP-A protein is normally ubiquitinated, there is no change in the level of SP-A protein ubiquitination or proteasome activity during RSV infection, suggesting that the reduced levels of SP-A protein are not due to degradation by activated proteasomes. SP-A mRNA is appropriately processed and exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during RSV infection. As evidenced by polysome analysis of SP-A mRNA and pulse-chase analysis of newly synthesized SP-A protein, we find a decrease in translational efficiency that is specific for SP-A mRNA. Therefore, the decrease in SP-A protein levels observed after RSV infection of pulmonary bronchiolar epithelial cells results from a mechanism that affects SP-A mRNA translation efficiency.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajplung.90507.2008",""

This paper examines the question of whether KIC users utilize different types of interaction techniques more quickly than non-KIC users. Participants were exposed to five conditions, each consisting of different computer tasks. One condition was used to determine KIC usage, the independent variable. The other four conditions were used to objectively measure performance in time (i.e., efficiency), one of the dependent variables. After each condition, participants completed the NASA-TLX survey, which was used as a subjective measure of workload, the second dependent variable. Task performance correlated strongly or moderately with KIC usage for all conditions, which indicates that KIC users finished all tasks more quickly than other users—even when they used other techniques than KICs to accomplish those tasks. There was no relationship between KIC usage and subjective workload.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/154193120905301508",""

Studies were graded by American Association for the Surgery of Trauma criteria, a novel splenic injury CT grading system, and a novel liver injury grading system.

Parenchymal cells have a major role in the trans-presentation of IL-15 to IELs, but the specific identity of this cell type is unknown. To investigate whether the intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) are the parenchymal cell type involved, a mouse model that expresses IL-15Rα exclusively by the IECs (Villin/IL-15Rα Tg) was generated. Exclusive expression of IL-15Rα by the IECs restored all the deficiencies in the CD8αα+TCRαβ+and CD8αα+TCRγδ+ subsets that exist in the absence of IL-15Rα. Interestingly, most of the IEL recovery was due to the preferential increase in Thy1low IELs, which compose a majority of the IEL population. The differentiation of Thy1highCD4−CD8− thymocytes into Thy1−CD8αα IELs was found to require IL-15Rα expression specifically by IECs and thus, provides evidence that differentiation of Thy1low IELs is one function of trans-presentation of IL-15 in the intestines. In addition to effects in IEL differentiation, trans-presentation of IL-15 by IECs also resulted in an increase in IEL numbers that was accompanied by increases in Bcl-2, but not proliferation. Collectively, this study demonstrates that trans-presentation of IL-15 by IECs alone is completely sufficient to direct the IL-15-mediated development of CD8αα+ T cell populations within the IEL compartment, which now includes a newly identified role of IL-15 in the differentiation of Thy1low IELs.","https://journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article-pdf/183/2/1044/1284161/zim01409001044.pdf",""

Discovering the anterior cruciate ligament injury risk factors associated with the tibial plateau may lead to delineation of the existing sex-based disparity in anterior cruciate ligament injuries and help develop strategies for the prevention of anterior cruciate ligament injuries regardless of gender. Hypothesis: Individuals with a shallower medial tibial depth of concavity, while having increased posteriorly directed slope of their tibial plateau, are at increased risk of suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury compared with those with decreased posterior slope and increased medial tibial depth. Furthermore, these relationships are different between men and women. Study Design: Case-control study (prevalence); Level of evidence, 3. Methods: The medial, lateral, and coronal tibial plateau slopes as well as the medial tibial depth of concavity in 55 uninjured controls (33 women and 22 men) and 49 anterior cruciate ligament—injured cases (27 women and 22 men) were measured using magnetic resonance images. First, a preliminary t test was performed to establish any existing differences between groups. Next, a logistic regression model was developed to determine the probability of anterior cruciate ligament injury in an individual based on the measured covariates. Results: The female anterior cruciate ligament—injured cases had increased lateral tibial slope (P = .03) and shallower medial tibial depth (P = .0003) compared with the uninjured controls, while male cases had increased lateral and medial tibial slope (P = .02) and shallower medial tibial depth (P = .0004) compared with controls. The logistic regression analysis and odds ratio estimates showed that medial tibial depth is an important risk factor (odds ratio = 3.03 per 1 mm decrease in its value), followed by lateral tibial slope (odds ratio = 1.17 per 1° increase in its value) in all participants. The medial tibial slope (odds ratio = 1.18 per 1° increase in its value) was a risk factor only in men. Conclusion: A combination of increased posterior-directed tibial plateau slope and shallow medial tibial plateau depth could be a major risk factor in anterior cruciate ligament injury susceptibility regardless of gender. Different injury risk models may be needed for men and women as other key risk factors are identified.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0363546509349055",""

A separate surgical dataset (n = 1756) was examined to determine surgical outcomes. “Elderly” was defined as 70 years old or older. Twenty-four per cent of patients in the institutional data set underwent surgery. Patients in the youngest age quartile (younger than 62 years) were more likely to undergo surgery, whereas the oldest quartile (older than 74 years) were less likely. In the surgical data set, 643 patients were elderly. No difference in combined 30-day/in-hospital mortality was noted (4 vs 2.9%). Five-year survival was 59.1 per cent for younger and 49.9 per cent for elderly patients. On multivariable analysis, age 70 years or older, male gender, increasing Charlson Comorbidity Index score, and pathologic stage were predictors of worse survival. Increasing age is an independent rick factor for surgical outcome and long-term survival after pulmonary resection for NSCLC, age appears to influence choice of initial treatment and extent of resection.

Plans were generated with Eclipse 8.0 (Varian Medical Systems) commissioned with beam data measured on a Clinac 21EX (Varian Medical Systems) operated with and without the flattening filter. Removal of the flattening filter increased the dose rate. The median beam‐on time per field was reduced from 25 sec (with the filter) to 11 sec (without the filter), increasing the feasibility of breath‐hold treatments and the efficiency of gated treatments. Differences in a dose heterogeneity index for the planning target volume between plans with flattened and unflattened beams were statistically insignificant. Differences in mean doses to organs at risk were small, typically about 10 cGy over the entire treatment. The study concludes that radiotherapy with unflattened beams is feasible and requires substantially less beam‐on time, facilitating breath‐hold and gating techniques.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1120%2Fjacmp.v10i1.2880",""

These classes are (1) low-frequency dim-out reservoirs, in which NI magnitude decreases toward lower frequencies; (2) phase-shift reservoirs, in which NI is a small negative value at low frequencies but becomes positive at higher frequencies; and (3) low-frequency bright-spot reservoirs, in which NI magnitude increases toward lower frequencies.

The model considers not only how consumers formulate their prepurchase decisions, but also how they form their long-term relationships with the same website vendor by comparing their prepurchase expectations to their actual purchase outcome. The results indicate that trust directly and indirectly affects a consumer's purchase decision in combination with perceived risk and perceived benefit, and also that trust has a longer term impact on consumer e-loyalty through satisfaction.

The dust aerosol optical thickness (AOT) in the SAL is inferred from the measurements taken by Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and the corresponding temperature and specific humidity anomalies are identified using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) data in August–September over the North Atlantic tropical cyclone (TC) main development region (MDR; 10°–20°N, 40°–60°W). The authors also study the SAL simulated in the National Center of Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Atmosphere Model, version 3 (CAM3), coupled with dust radiative effect. It is found that higher AOT is associated with warmer and dryer anomalies below 700 hPa, which increases the atmospheric stability. The calculated instantaneous radiative heating anomalies from a radiative transfer model indicate that both the dust and low humidity are essential to maintaining the temperature structure in the SAL against thermal relaxation. At 850 hPa, heating anomalies caused by both the dust and dry anomalies (for AOT &gt; 0.8) are 0.2–0.4 K day−1. The dust heats the atmosphere below 600 hPa, while the dry anomaly cools the atmosphere below 925 hPa, resulting in a peak of heating rate anomaly located at 700–850 hPa. In the eastern Atlantic, dust contributes about 50% of the heating rate anomaly. Westward of 40°W, when the dust content becomes small (AOT &lt; 0.6), the heating rates are more sensitive to the water vapor profile used in the radiative transfer calculation. Retrieving or simulating correct water vapor profiles is essential to the assessment of the SAL heating budgets in regions where the dust content in the SAL is small.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jcli/article-pdf/22/19/5149/3964435/2009jcli2847_1.pdf",""

Because the cross sections are quantum mechanical in nature, this surface rate model should be applicable to many low temperature plasma processing systems. Further, the parameters that might be important in reaction cross sections are known from quantum mechanics, e.g., species, energy, temperature, and impact angle. Such parameters might vary from system to system, causing the wide processing variability observed in plasma tools.

However, recent studies suggest that low phospho-IGF-IR (pIGF-IR) expression rather than its overexpression may be an indicator of poorly differentiated disease. No previous study has evaluated the expression of pIGF-IR to determine if activation or loss of expression of this receptor is associated with thyroid tumor progression. Accordingly, a quantitative immunohistochemical (IHC) method was used to evaluate the clinico-pathological significance of pIGF-IR expression in archival samples of human thyroid carcinomas. Quantitative analysis of pIGF-IR levels revealed a significant difference in the median index of pIGF-IR between different histological subtypes of thyroid cancer ( P < 0.001). Specifically, the median pIGF-IR index of differentiated thyroid cancers was significantly higher than the median index of other poorly differentiated thyroid cancer ( P < 0.001). This was further confirmed in individual tumor sections of thyroid carcinoma where anaplastic and differentiated components co-existed. No significant difference was noted in the pIGF-IR index of tumors grouped by size or stage but a trend towards lower mean pIGF-IR index was noted in older patients. Our data indicates that pIGF-IR is upregulated in a majority of follicular thyroid carcinomas, suggesting it may be a potential target for therapy for patients with this disease. In addition, since low pIGF-IR expression was found to correlate with aggressive human thyroid carcinoma, it also suggests that IGF-IR may not be needed for progression of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma possibly because other cell signaling pathways are activated, obviating the need for IGF-IR signaling. However, more mechanistic studies would be necessary to substantiate the possibility that pIGF-IR may be important for differentiation of thyroid tissues and is lost with disease progression.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3181/0809-RM-284",""

Vertical velocities cannot be recovered simultaneously with the dimensionless anisotropy parameters. Also, the density cannot be solved because it does not affect the normal moveout of P and S reflections. These limitations can be overcome using full-wavefield inversion for anisotropy parameters for orthorhombic media and for transversely isotropic media with vertical and horizontal symmetry axes. Tsvankin’s parameters and the orientation of the local (anisotropic) coordinates are inverted from three-component, wide-azimuth data sets containing P reflected and PS converted waves. The inversions are performed in two steps. The first step uses only reflections from the top of an anisotropic layer, whichdoes not constrain the trade-offs between the vertical velocities, the anisotropies, and density, as shown by parameter correlation analysis. The results from the first step are refined by using them as the starting model for the second step, which fits reflections from the top and bottom of the layer. The properties of the target layer influence the amplitudes of top and bottom reflections as well as the traveltime of the bottom reflections; when all these data are used, the inversion is highly overdetermined and all model parameters are estimated accurately. When Gaussian noise is added, the inversion results are very similar to those for the noise-free data because only the coherent signal is fitted. The residual at convergence for the noisy data corresponds to the noise level. Concurrent inversion of data from multiple sources increases the azimuthal illumination of a target.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/1.3204766",""

This study examines the incidence of axillary pCR and the effect of axillary pCR on disease-free survival (DFS) in patients (pts) with HER2 positive disease and biopsy-proven axillary metastases that received trastuzumab-based NCT.Material and Methods:The records of 109 consecutive pts with HER2 positive breast cancer and ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy-confirmed axillary metastases were analyzed. All pts received trastuzumab-based NCT prior to undergoing breast surgery with complete axillary lymph node (ALN) dissections. After surgery, patients were subdivided into those with and without residual ALN disease. Survival was evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method.Results:Of patients with documented positive ALNs before chemotherapy, 81 (74%) had an ALN pCR. ALN pCR was not associated with estrogen receptor status, grade, tumor size or age (p=NS). The median number of nodes removed was 19 in the ALN pCR group and 18.5 in the group with residual axillary disease (p=NS). The only significant difference between the groups was that more patients in the ALN pCR group achieved complete pathologic response of disease within the breast (p&lt;0.001) (78% with and 25% without ALN pCR, respectively). At a median follow-up of 29.1 months, DFS in the ALN pCR group (95%) was significantly greater than in the group with residual axillary disease (81%) on Kaplan-Meier analysis (p=0.02).Discussion:Trastuzumab-based NCT results in axillary pCR in 74% of patients with HER2 positive disease. These pts have improved DFS compared with patients with residual disease. The majority of patients with proven axillary metastases will have eradication of disease after treatment with trastuzumab-based NCT, and this has implications for the surgical management of the axilla in these types of pts.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/69/24_Supplement/1086/550176/Eradication-of-Axillary-Lymph-Node-Metastases",""

Glutathione (GSH) and GSH-linked metabolism is a primary defense against oxidative stress. Electrophilic lipid alkenals, such as 4-hydroxy-t-2-nonenal (4HNE), generated during oxidative stress are metabolized primarily to glutathione electrophile (GS-E) conjugates. Recent studies show that RLIP76 is the primary GS-E conjugate transporter in cells, and a regulator of oxidative-stress response. Because RLIP76−/− mice are hypoglycemic, we studied the role of RLIP76 in insulin resistance. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Blood glucose, insulin, lipid measurements, and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamp experiments were performed in RLIP76+/+ and RLIP76−/− C57B mice, using Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee–approved protocols. Time-resolved three-dimensional confocal fluorescence microscopy was used to study insulin endocytosis. RESULTS: The plasma insulin/glucose ratio was ordered RLIP76−/− &lt; RLIP76+/− &lt; RLIP76+/+; administration of purified RLIP76 in proteoliposomes to RLIP76+/+ animals further increased this ratio. RLIP76 was induced by oxidative or hyperglycemic stress; the concomitant increase in insulin endocytosis was completely abrogated by inhibiting the transport activity of RLIP76. Hydrocortisone could transiently correct hypoglycemia in RLIP76−/− animals, despite inhibited activity of key glucocorticoid-regulated hepatic gluconeogenic enzymes, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, and fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, in RLIP76−/−. CONCLUSIONS: The GS-E conjugate transport activity of RLIP76 mediates insulin resistance by enhancing the rate of clathrin-dependent endocytosis of insulin. Because RLIP76 is induced by oxidative stress, it could play a role in insulin resistance seen in pathological conditions characterized by increased oxidative stress.","https://journals.org/diabetes/diabetes/article-pdf/59/3/714/662951/zdb00310000714.pdf",""

EDGE ISAs use a block-atomic execution model in which blocks are composed of dataflow instructions. The goal of the TRIPS design is to mine concurrency for high performance while tolerating emerging technology scaling challenges, such as increasing wire delays and power consumption. This paper evaluates how well TRIPS meets this goal through a detailed ISA and performance analysis. We compare performance, using cycles counts, to commercial processors. On SPEC CPU2000, the Intel Core 2 outperforms compiled TRIPS code in most cases, although TRIPS matches a Pentium 4. On simple benchmarks, compiled TRIPS code outperforms the Core 2 by 10% and hand-optimized TRIPS code outperforms it by factor of 3. Compared to conventional ISAs, the block-atomic model provides a larger instruction window, increases concurrency at a cost of more instructions executed, and replaces register and memory accesses with more efficient direct instruction-to-instruction communication. Our analysis suggests ISA, microarchitecture, and compiler enhancements for addressing weaknesses in TRIPS and indicates that EDGE architectures have the potential to exploit greater concurrency in future technologies.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2528521.1508246",""

Hyperglycemia is an on-target side effect of many inhibitors of PI3K/Akt signaling including the specific PI3K inhibitor PX-866. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ agonist pioglitazone, used to treat type 2 diabetes, prevents a decrease in glucose tolerance caused by acute administration of PX-866. Our studies have shown that pioglitazone does not inhibit the antitumor activity of PX-866 in A-549 non-small cell lung cancer and HT-29 colon cancer xenografts. In vitro studies also showed that pioglitazone increases 2-[1-14C]deoxy-d-glucose uptake in L-6 muscle cells and prevents inhibition of 2-deoxyglucose uptake by PX-866. Neither pioglitazone nor PX-866 had an effect on 2-deoxyglucose uptake in A-549 lung cancer cells. In vivo imaging studies using [18F]2-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography showed that pioglitazone increases FDG accumulation by normal tissue but does not significantly alter FDG uptake by A-549 xenografts. Thus, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ agonists may be useful in overcoming the increase in blood glucose caused by inhibitors of PI3K signaling by preventing the inhibition of normal tissue insulin-mediated glucose uptake without affecting antitumor activity.

An energy-based mesoscale computational model is used to elucidate critical interrelationships between physical properties of the nanopore, electric field strength, and translocation kinetics. We report a nonlinear increase in DNA translocation speed with increasing electric field strength.

EDGE ISAs use a block-atomic execution model in which blocks are composed of dataflow instructions. The goal of the TRIPS design is to mine concurrency for high performance while tolerating emerging technology scaling challenges, such as increasing wire delays and power consumption. This paper evaluates how well TRIPS meets this goal through a detailed ISA and performance analysis. We compare performance, using cycles counts, to commercial processors. On SPEC CPU2000, the Intel Core 2 outperforms compiled TRIPS code in most cases, although TRIPS matches a Pentium 4. On simple benchmarks, compiled TRIPS code outperforms the Core 2 by 10% and hand-optimized TRIPS code outperforms it by factor of 3. Compared to conventional ISAs, the block-atomic model provides a larger instruction window, increases concurrency at a cost of more instructions executed, and replaces register and memory accesses with more efficient direct instruction-to-instruction communication. Our analysis suggests ISA, microarchitecture, and compiler enhancements for addressing weaknesses in TRIPS and indicates that EDGE architectures have the potential to exploit greater concurrency in future technologies.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1508284.1508246",""

Specifically, it supposes that if a spatiotemporal precipitation field with a stationary covariance Cov(r, τ) in both space r and time τ moves with a constant velocity v, then the temporal covariance at time lag τ is equal to the spatial covariance at space lag r = vτ that is, Cov(0, τ) = Cov(vτ, 0). Qualitatively this means that the field evolves slowly in time relative to the advective time scale, which is often referred to as the frozen field hypothesis. Of specific interest is whether there is a cutoff or decorrelation time scale for which the TH holds for a given mean flow velocity v. In this study, the validity of the TH is tested for precipitation fields using high-resolution gridded Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) reflectivity data produced by the WSI Corporation by employing two different statistical approaches. The first method is based on rigorous hypothesis testing, while the second is based on a simple correlation analysis, which neglects possible dependencies between the correlation estimates. Radar reflectivity values are used from the southeastern United States with an approximate horizontal resolution of 4 km × 4 km and a temporal resolution of 15 min. During the 4-day period from 2 to 5 May 2002, substantial precipitation occurs in the region of interest, and the motion of the precipitation systems is approximately uniform. The results of both statistical methods suggest that the TH might hold for the shortest space and time scales resolved by the data (4 km and 15 min) but that it does not hold for longer periods or larger spatial scales. Also, the simple correlation analysis tends to overestimate the statistical significance through failing to account for correlations between the covariance estimates.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jhm/article-pdf/10/1/254/4104600/2008jhm1009_1.pdf",""

While individual components of the network have been studied through experimental and computational methods, the network robustness and the flow of information through the network have not been characterized in a quantitative framework. Using a probability based model implemented through GRID computing, we approach the reduced signaling network and show that the network is highly robust and the final stable steady state is independent of the initial configurations. However, the path from the initial and the final state is intrinsically dependent on the state of the input nodes. Our results demonstrate a rugged funnel-like landscape for the signaling network where the final state is unique, but the paths are dependent on initial conditions.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.3149857/16768717/235103_1_online.pdf",""

Despite the proximity of core locations, some proxy reconstructions record a surface cooling, while others indicate a warming. We suggest that this seemingly paradoxical finding may, at least partially, be attributed to the competing physical processes that result in opposing signs of temperature change in the region in response to weakened North Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. Our coupled ocean‐atmosphere model experiments indicate that the temperature response over the southern Caribbean and Western Tropical Atlantic regions is complex and can vary considerably in small spatial scales, depending on the nature of physical processes that dominate.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2008GL035805",""
