The current assumption is that these students are best served by extending the time they have to take a test. It is the supposition of these investigators that paced item presentation may be a more beneficial accommodation than extended time. To test the effects of paced item presentation, the investigators designed a mixed methods sequential explanatory study to explore the relationship between computer-paced and student-paced item presentation on the academic test performance in college students diagnosed with ADHD. The participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 testing conditions. Half of the participants were provided a computer-paced testing condition, and half were provided a student-paced testing condition within a computer-based environment. Interviews were conducted after the test administration to discern the students' perceptions of the value of the various components of the testing environment. No significant differences were found in performance scores between the students tested under the two conditions; however, the interview data illuminated the quantitative findings in that the students reported that the computer-based testing environment itself, as well as other environmental variables, provided a beneficial structure and format conducive to their overall successful performance under both accommodations. The practicability of university disability offices offering a computerized format for students diagnosed with ADHD is also discussed.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2190/EC.39.2.b",""

A clear problem is how such laws are limited to national jurisdictions. What is legal in one country may be illegal in another. Due to differences in cultures and values, and government types, it may not be possible to establish global standards and legislations to ensure privacy. Due to the nonexistence of global privacy standards, multinational (international) companies usually select one of the following two possible solutions: (1) implement a most restrictive “one size fits all” privacy policy that is used across various countries, or (2) implement different privacy policies that meet the privacy regulations of different countries and expectations of those citizens. In order to investigate a solution that may be used by multinational companies, and how companies view domestic privacy laws, the authors conducted a survey of U.S.-based employees of domestic and multinational companies. The results of the survey suggest that the majority of the multinational companies prefer the first solution—most restrictive “one size fits all” approach. They develop and implement a single set of privacy policies that is used across their operations in different countries. The majority of the companies surveyed consider domestic privacy laws in the United States to be practical, but ineffective.","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=9895",""

In the second process, scales measuring different constructs are based on the same items. Results show that both of the processes described above contribute to the use of the same NYS items in scales that are attributed to different theories.

Accelerated crystallite formation after nanoimprint was observed and a method to suppress crystallites was explored. In patterned As2S3 microstructures, optical birefringence was observed near the pattern edges, which potentially has a significant impact on the optical properties of patterned microstructures.

Nanoimprint-induced chain orientation in conjugated polymer imparts strong optical birefringence in patterned microstructures. X-ray diffraction on patterned films exhibits higher level of chain ordering as nanoimprint temperature increases. Polarized absorption spectra show progressive redshift at higher nanoimprint temperature. The carrier mobility in thin-film transistors based on nanoimprinted grating equals to 12 times of that without patterning.

Problems are amplified by reliance on a few complex wells with sophisticated sand-control media. New downhole data are required for better understanding and prevention of production impairment. We introduce real-time completion monitoring (RTCM), a new nonintrusive surveillance method that uses acoustic signals sent via the fluid column to identify permeability impairment in sand-screened completions. The signals are carried by tube waves that move borehole fluid back and forth radially across the completion layers. Such tube waves are capable of instant testing of the presence or absence of fluid communication across the completion and are sensitive to changes occurring in sand screens, gravel sand, perforations, and possibly in the reservoir. The part of the completion that has different impairment from its neighbors will carry tube waves with modified signatures (velocity, attenuation) and will produce a reflection from the boundary where impairment changes. We conduct a laboratory experiment with a model of a completed horizontal borehole and focus on effects of sand-screen permeability on transmitted and reflected acoustic signatures. These new findings form the basis of an RTCM method that can be thought of as “miniaturized” 4D seismic and as a “permanent log” in an individual wellbore. We present experiments with a fiber-optic acoustic system that suggest a nonintrusive way to install downhole sensors on the pipe in realistic completions and thus implement real-time surveillance with RTCM.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/1.2818117",""

The study took place within a policy context in which the federal government, with the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act (2002), created a new category of students (economically disadvantaged) whose test scores would be monitored by officials in the U. S. Department of Education. This law ensures that the improvement of poor children's test scores becomes a major concern of every public school in the country. These federal requirements have fueled the demand for professional development programs such as that offered by Ruby Payne and her Aha! Process, Inc. Purpose: This article reports on an examination of the content of Ruby Payne's professional development offerings, as represented in A Framework for Understanding Poverty. Given the immense popularity of the program, an assessment of its representations of poor people is warranted and significant. We analyzed the relationship between Payne's claims and the existing research about low-income individuals and families. This study of Payne's work provides administrators and teachers with an evaluation of the reliability of Payne's claims. It also provides scholars in education, anthropology, sociology, and related fields with a description and critique of one of the more common conversations that is engaging teachers about the nature of the lives of many of their students, and the struggle to identify directions in which to improve schooling for the most vulnerable students in the education system. Research Design: This is a qualitative research study whose data were derived from an analysis of A Framework for Understanding Poverty. Conclusions/Recommendations: Our critical analysis of Payne's characterizations of people living in poverty indicates that her work represents a classic example of what has been identified as deficit thinking. We found that her truth claims, offered without any supporting evidence, are contradicted by anthropological, sociological and other research on poverty. We have demonstrated through our analysis that teachers may be misinformed by Payne's claims. As a consequence of low teacher expectations, poor students are more likely to be in lower tracks or lower ability groups and their educational experience more often dominated by rote drill and practice.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/016146810811001201",""

The current method for estimating empirical landfall probabilities is to report a frequency based on the number of storms affecting a region over a certain period of time. A spatial dimension is added in this study to determine which storms in all portions of the basin might ultimately strike the United States based on the historical record. For example, if a tropical cyclone is near the island of Puerto Rico, which portions (if any) of the U.S. coastline are most at risk of eventual landfall? A tessellation of hexagons is systematically evaluated, and eventual landfall probabilities are calculated for all storms passing through each hexagon. Probabilities are calculated and mapped for four individual states and for the United States as a whole. The maps show the spatial areas that contribute storms to each of the states. In addition, an average length of time until landfall is calculated for the entire Atlantic basin based on the complete period of record. This highlights regions of the Atlantic basin lying outside of the maximum forecast period, up to 15 days prior to potential landfall.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jamc/article-pdf/47/2/704/3543182/2007jamc1711_1.pdf",""

We demonstrate that the dominating NBTI-induced defect in the plasma-nitrided devices is fundamentally different than those observed in pure SiO2-based devices. (In pure SiO2 devices, we observe NBTI-induced Pb0 and Pb1 defects.) Our measurements indicate that the NBTI-induced defect in the plasma-nitrided devices extends into the gate dielectric. The defect participates in both spin-dependent recombination and spin-dependent tunneling. The defect also has a density of states which is more narrowly peaked than that of Pb centers near the middle of the band gap. The high sensitivity of our spin-dependent tunneling measurements allow for an identification of the physical and chemical nature of this defect through observations of Si29 hyperfine interactions. We identify these defects as silicon dangling bond defects in which the central silicon is back bonded to nitrogen atoms. We assign these NBTI-induced defects as KN centers because of their similarity to K centers observed in silicon nitride. (The silicon nitride K centers are also silicon dangling bond defects in which the silicon atom is back-bonded to nitrogen atoms.) The defect identification in plasma-nitrided devices helps to explain (1) why NBTI is exacerbated in nitrided devices, (2) conflicting reports of NBTI-induced interface states and/or bulk traps, and (3) fluorine’s ineffectiveness in reducing NBTI in nitrided devices.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.2844348/15000954/044505_1_online.pdf",""

Recent animal and human research has made great progress in the study of SG, and in this review we provide an overview of recent research on SG using different methods. Animal research has uncovered findings that suggest 1) SG is displayed by single neurons and can be similar to SG observed from scalp recordings in humans, 2) SG is found in numerous brain structures located in sensory, motor and limbic subregions, 3) SG can be significantly influenced by state changes of the organism, and 4) SG has a diverse pharmacological profile accented by a strong influence from nicotine receptor activation. Human research has addressed similar issues using deep electrode recordings of brain structures. These experiments have revealed that 1) SG can be found in cortical regions surrounding hippocampus, 2) the order of neural processing places hippocampal involvement during a later stage of sensory processing than originally thought, and 3) multiple subtypes of gating exist that could be dependent on different brain circuits and more or less influenced by alterations in organismal state. Animal and human research both have limitations. We emphasize the need for integrative approaches to understand the process and combine information between basic and clinical fields so that a more complete picture of SG will emerge.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/155005940803900209",""

We predicted that exposure to Spanish would not affect the English phonetic inventory but would increase error frequency and type in bilingual children. Method: Single-word speech samples were collected from 33 children. Phonetically transcribed samples for the 3 groups (monolingual English children, English–Spanish bilingual children who were predominantly exposed to English, and English–Spanish bilingual children with relatively equal exposure to English and Spanish) were compared at 2 time points and for change over time for phonetic inventory, phoneme accuracy, and error pattern frequencies. Results: Children demonstrated similar phonetic inventories. Some bilingual children produced Spanish phonemes in their English and produced few consonant cluster sequences. Bilingual children with relatively equal exposure to English and Spanish averaged more errors than did bilingual children who were predominantly exposed to English. Both bilingual groups showed higher error rates than English-only children overall, particularly for syllable-level error patterns. All language groups decreased in some error patterns, although the ones that decreased were not always the same across language groups. Some group differences of error patterns and accuracy were significant. Vowel error rates did not differ by language group. Conclusion: Exposure to English and Spanish may result in a higher English error rate in typically developing bilinguals, including the application of Spanish phonological properties to English. Slightly higher error rates are likely typical for bilingual preschool-aged children. Change over time at these time points for all 3 groups was similar, suggesting that all will reach an adult-like system in English with exposure and practice.","http://pubs.asha.org/doi/pdf/10.1044/0161-1461%282008/030%29",""

The progression of decision support system types that have emerged follows to some degree the increasing complexity of the problems being addressed. Some of the early DSS involved single decision-makers utilizing spreadsheet models to solve problems. Such an approach would be inadequate in addressing complex problems because one aspect of problem complexity is that multiple stakeholders typically exist. Baldwin (1993) examined the need for supporting multiple views and provides the only attempt found in the information systems literature to operationalize the concept of a perspective. In his work, a view is defined as a set of beliefs that partially describe a general subject of discourse. He identified three major components of a view: the belief or notion to convey, a language to represent the notion, and a subject of discourse. He further described notions as comprising aspects and a vantage point. Aspects are the characteristics or attributes of a subject or situation that a particular notion emphasizes. A vantage point is described by the level of detail (i.e., overview or detailed analysis). Assuming the subject of discourse can be identified with the notion, Baldwin described how differences in views may occur via differences in the notion, the language, or both.","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=11266",""

We analyzed data from 491 African-Americans with lung cancer and 497 matched African-American controls to identify specific risks and incorporate them into a multivariable risk model for lung cancer and estimate the 5-year absolute risk of lung cancer. We performed internal and external validations of the risk model using data on additional cases and controls from the same ongoing multiracial/ethnic lung cancer case-control study from which the model-building data were obtained as well as data from two different lung cancer studies in metropolitan Detroit, respectively. We also compared our African-American model with our previously developed risk prediction model for whites. The final risk model included smoking-related variables [smoking status, pack-years smoked, age at smoking cessation (former smokers), and number of years since smoking cessation (former smokers)], self-reported physician diagnoses of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or hay fever, and exposures to asbestos or wood dusts. Our risk prediction model for African-Americans exhibited good discrimination [75% (95% confidence interval, 0.67–0.82)] for our internal data and moderate discrimination [63% (95% confidence interval, 0.57–0.69)] for the external data group, which is an improvement over the Spitz model for white subjects.

Flows within the fracture, between the fracture and the adjacent matrix, and through the pore space within the matrix typically happen on different length and time scales. Capturing these scales experimentally is difficult. It is therefore useful to have a computational tool that establishes the exact position and shape of fluid/fluid interfaces in realistic fracture geometries. The level set method is such a tool. Our progressive quasistatic (PQS) algorithm based on the level set method finds detailed, pore-level fluid configurations satisfying the Young-Laplace equation at a series of prescribed capillary pressures. The fluid volumes, contact areas and interface curvatures are readily extracted from the configurations. The method automatically handles topological changes of the fluid volumes as capillary pressure varies. It also accommodates arbitrarily complicated shapes of solid confining surfaces.","https://onepetro.org/SPEATCE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/116110-MS/2735244/spe-116110-ms.pdf",""

The coexistence of measurable liquid water droplets and ice crystals begins at or within tens of meters of cloud top and extends down to cloud base. Ice virga is found below cloud base. Peak liquid water contents occur at or near cloud top while peak ice water contents occur in the lower half of the cloud or in virga.

This study followed an inductive reasoning approach to investigate the implementation of strategic planning in American law enforcement agencies and then develop theoretical models that might capture variation across organizations. Based on the initial results from telephone interviews and selective site visits, we were able to identify two key dimensions that seemed to differentiate the implementation of strategic planning among these law enforcement agencies. As a consequence, four styles of strategic planning emerged. This article discusses the development of strategic planning in U.S. police agencies and implications for the future.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1098611107309624",""

The measured PL decay lifetimes of the acceptor-bound exciton transitions in Be- and Mg-doped AlN (93 and 119ps, respectively) also indicate that the binding energy of Be acceptor is smaller than that of the most common acceptor dopant in AlN, namely, Mg. The smaller activation energy of Be in AlN has the potential to partly address the critical p-type doping issue in AlN- and Al-rich AlGaN by increasing the room temperature free hole concentration by ∼103 compared to the case of Mg doping.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.2996977/13316914/141104_1_online.pdf",""

Contrary to some fathers' claims that mothers “gatekeep” their access to children, the majority of mothers in our study wanted increased father involvement. The mothers' desire for active father–child interaction was not dampened by their frustration at the lack or irregularity of child support payment, which mothers tended to accept, given the lack of economic opportunities in rural communities. Despite their wishes to promote father–child contact, mothers also experienced frustration and distrust toward former partners when they perceived that the fathers were not fulfilling their expected parental roles. This study demonstrates that mothers' actions, which may be interpreted as gatekeeping by the fathers, are often not intended to discourage father involvement but rather are meant to negotiate more acceptable father behavior.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0192513X08321543",""

Each component of ethnic identity (i.e., exploration, resolution, and affirmation) was positively associated with concurrent assessments of adolescents' self-esteem. However, in the longitudinal analyses, none of the ethnic identity components predicted future levels of self-esteem. Ethnic identity resolution was the only ethnic identity component to predict proactive coping over time. Furthermore, proactive coping did not mediate the relationship between ethnic identity and self-esteem. However, there was evidence to suggest that the association between proactive coping and self-esteem was bidirectional. These findings underscore the importance of examining the unique components of ethnic identity as well as using longitudinal designs to examine the associations between ethnic identity and adolescents' psychological well-being.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0272431607308666",""

In the 1920s and 1930s, Rockefeller philanthropies in particular financed behavioral science research projects that promised to fulfill their mandates to `improve mankind', mandates that foundation officers transformed into an informal, loosely defined human engineering effort. Controlling behavior, especially sexual and social `dysfunction', was a major priority. The behavioral scientists at Yale University, led by president James R. Angell and `psychobiologist' Robert M. Yerkes, tapped into foundation largesse by crafting research programs that promised to contribute to the `welfare of mankind' through the investigation and control of sexual and social behavior. Foundation officers supported Yerkes' primate research because they accepted his premise that analyzing chimpanzee sexual behavior would yield valuable insights into the evolutionary underpinnings of human development and would thus give investigators the necessary information to ameliorate dysfunction. Between 1925 and 1940, philanthropic foundations contributed approximately $7 million to support the Yale Institute of Human Relations and the affiliated Yerkes Laboratories of Primate Biology. Yet, disappointment with the results of the Yale appropriations ultimately contributed to foundation officers turning away from behavioral sciences and toward biological sciences as they continued their efforts to improve mankind through human engineering. This article examines the interaction between foundation officers and Yale behavioral scientists to illustrate how scientific entrepreneurs successfully crafted rationales about human sexuality to solicit funds, how philanthropic foundation officers became enmeshed in the behavioral science research projects that they funded, and how a cooperative human engineering effort at Yale developed in the 1920s and unraveled in the 1930s.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0952695108091411",""

We design three efficient algorithms to implement the new operator in relational databases: (1) nested-loops NOJ algorithm (NL-NOJ); (2) sortmerge NOJ algorithm (SM-NOJ); and (3) simple hash NOJ algorithm (SH-NOJ). Based on a real-life RDF dataset, we demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms by comparing them with the corresponding left outer join implementations and explore the effect of join selectivity on the performance of our algorithms.</p>","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=2854",""

This research, which mapped the nature and role of meaningful mathematical discourse, provides insights into discursive practices that lead to rich mathematical interactions. We observed, coded, and analyzed middle school algebra, number, and data lessons using a grounded theory approach. We organized the observed paths that emerged into a map depicting actual paths for mathematics discourse. The results indicated that communication pathways between the teacher and students occur in many ways, and certain student-initiated questions may trigger predictable teaching patterns. Conversation that originates with the teacher often results in dialogue that is one-dimensional, mostly provides factual information, and rarely results in rich, meaningful mathematical dialogue. However, when students engage in the teacher's conversation or they are persistent in their own questioning, teachers tended to provide more detailed explanations, and teachers often embellished with new examples and representations using nuanced solution methods. Although results seem to indicate that teaching children to be persistent with their questioning will enhance understanding, this behavior may be interpreted as threatening to some teachers. Therefore, caution is warranted when attempting to turn these findings into action. It is important that, before instructing students about being persistent with questions, teachers understand the students' intentions. Although participants did not have negative reactions to persistent student questioning, some children might experience negative responses without proper professional development for teachers.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.4219/jaa-2008-809",""

Tracking control is then realized by employing input-output feedback linearization. To achieve typical complex formation missions, a two-layer hierarchical architecture is proposed. At the upper layer, a null-space method is utilized to prioritize the tasks of the robot team and to generate reference trajectories for formation control. In the lower layer, the control scheme for each individual robot guarantees asymptotic tracking of the desired trajectories. Numerical simulations of a realistic case study illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/DSCC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/DSCC2008-2244/4573748/1043_1.pdf",""

Periodic arrangements of well-dispersed and clustered/bundled SWCNTs are studied using the commercially available finite element software COMSOL Multiphysics 3.4. The volume averaged electric field and electric flux obtained are used to calculate the effective electrical conductivity of nanocomposites in both cases, therefore indicating the influence of clustering on the effective electrical conductivity. In addition, the influence of the presence of an interphase region on the effective electrical conductivity is considered in a parametric study in terms of both interphase thickness and conductivity for both the well dispersed case and for the clustered arrangements. Comparing the well-dispersed case with an interphase layer to the same arrangement without the interphase layer allows for the assessment of the influence of the interphase layer on the effective electrical conductivities, while similar comparisons for the clustered arrangements yield information about the combined effects of clustering and interphase regions. Initial results indicate that there is very little influence of the interphase layer on the effective conductivity prior to what is identified as the interphase percolation concentration, and that there is an appreciable combined effect of clustering in the presence of interphase regions which leads to increases in conductivity larger than the sum of the two effects independently.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/SMASIS/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/SMASIS2008-670/2692522/159_1.pdf",""

A cryoelectron microscopic reconstruction of Sindbis virus (SVHR) neutralized with FAb from Sin-33 (FAb-33) revealed conformational changes on the surface of the virion at a resolution of 24 Å. FAb-33 was found to bind E1 in less than 1:1 molar ratios, as shown by the absence of FAb density in the reconstruction and stoichiometric measurements using radiolabeled FAb-33, which determined that about 60 molecules of FAb-33 bound to the 240 possible sites in a single virus particle. FAb-33-neutralized virus particles became sensitive to digestion by endoproteinase Glu-C, providing further evidence of antibody-induced structural changes within the virus particle. The treatment of FAb-33-neutralized or Sin-33-neutralized SVHR with low pH did not induce the conformational rearrangements required for virus membrane-cell membrane fusion. Exposure to low pH, however, increased the amount of Sin-33 or FAb-33 that bound to the virus particles, indicating the exposure of additional epitopes. The neutralization of SVHR infection by FAb-33 or Sin-33 did not prevent the association of virus with host cells. These data are in agreement with the results of previous studies that demonstrated that specific antibodies can inactivate the infectious state of a metastable virus in vitro by the induction of conformational changes to produce an inactive structure. A model is proposed which postulates that the induction of conformational changes in the infectious state of a metastable enveloped virus may be a general mechanism of antibody inactivation of virus infectivity.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.02673-07",""

We present experimental results which provide insight into granular behavior in natural faults. The experiments allow us to directly image force chains within a deforming granular media through the use of photoelastic particles. The experimental apparatus consists of a spring‐pulled slider block which deforms the photoelastic granular aggregate at a constant velocity. Particles that carry more of the load appear brighter when viewed through crossed polarizers, making the internal stresses optically accessible. The resulting pattern is a branched, anisotropic force chain network inclined to the shear zone boundaries. Under both constant volume and dilational boundary conditions, deformation occurs predominantly through stick‐slip displacements and corresponding force drops. The particle motion and force chain changes associated with the deformation can either be localized to the central slip zone or span the system. The sizes of the experimental slip events are observed to have power law (Gutenberg‐Richter‐like) distributions; the minimum dimensions of events and the behavior of force chains suggest that a particle scale controls the lower limits of the power law distributions. For large drops in pulling force with slip, the shape of the size distributions is strongly affected by the choice of boundary condition, while for small to moderate drops the probability distributions are approximately independent of boundary condition. These size‐dependent variations in stick‐slip behavior are associated with different spatial patterns: on average, small events typically correspond to localized force chain or particle rearrangements, whereas large events correspond to system‐spanning changes. Such force chain behavior may be responsible for similar size‐dependent behaviors of natural faults.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2008JB005781",""

Defect etching revealed that threading dislocations (TDs) in the supercritical thickness sSi samples are more evenly distributed, while they are severely trapped inside TD pileups in the subcritical thickness sSi samples. It is proposed that relaxation of the supercritical sSi layer, which is realized by TD gliding under a tensile stress, helps to breakup those pileups formed under a compressive stress. Defect etching revealed a TD density of (3–5)×106 cm−2, and no dependence on the sSi or SiGe thickness was observed. Raman spectroscopy revealed that the relaxation degree of the 300 nm SiGe layer decreases from 80% to 67% with the sSi layer increasing from 8 to 40 nm. This suggests a continuous relaxation of the highly compressively strained, thin SiGe buffer during or even after sSi growth, and its gradual suppression by the presence of a tensile strained sSi layer. The 600 nm SiGe buffer has an ∼82% relaxation for all sSi thickness, suggesting that its relatively small residual strain cannot support any further relaxation after switching to sSi growth and consequently the absence of any dependence on sSi thickness. Based on these observations, we suggest that an in situ thermal annealing prior to the sSi growth will help to enhance the strain relaxation of thin SiGe buffers.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.2986940/15026326/074904_1_online.pdf",""

There are 481 UCRs described and more than 50% of all the UCRs (256/481) has been classified as non exonic (with no evidence of coding protein), while the other 47% have been designated either exonic (overlap mRNAs of known genes), or possible exonic (with no clear evidence of overlap with protein coding genes) (Bejerano et al, Science 2004). Recently, our group reported that a subset of transcribed UCRs is aberrantly expressed in leukemia (Calin et al, Cancer Cell 2007). Because of the high degree of conservation, the UCRs are likely to be functional and may be involved in the phylogeny of mammals. Since hematopoiesis is regulated by signaling pathways and transcription factors that are highly conserved throughout phylogeny, we hypothesize that UCRs may be differentially expressed in hematopoietic tissues and may play a role in the regulation of this process. In this study we analyzed the UCRs expression in normal hematopoiesis by performing microarray analysis of hematopoietic precursors (HPCs) obtained by culturing human bone marrow (non-mobilized) CD34+ selected cells with different cytokine combinations for 2 weeks to stimulate differentiation to the erythrocyte (E), megakaryocyte (MK), monocyte (M) and granulocyte lineages (G). The following cytokine combinations were used: E (TPO/SCF/IL-3); G (G-CSF, GM-CSF, SCF, IL-3, IL-3); MK (TPO, SCF, IL-3) and M (M-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-6, IL-3 and SCF). Differentiation to the selected lineages was monitored every 3 days using morphology, special staining (benzidine) and flow cytometry analysis using appropriate lineage specific antibodies. Human bone marrow CD34+ and peripheral blood (PB) CD3+ (pan-T cells) and CD19+ (B-lymphocytes) selected cells were obtained from 3 different donors. Total RNA was obtained from the E and M cultures at days 7, 9, 11 and 14; G (days 10 and 14) and MK at day 14 and was hybridized in duplicate to the UCRs microarray chip (OSU version 4). After normalization of the array data with quantiles we analyzed the data using the BRB tools.","https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/112/11/2461/60862/Ultraconserved-Genomic-Regions-UCRs-Expression-in",""

We characterize the potential for hyporheic exchange in covered channels using linked turbulent channel flow/groundwater flow simulations. Simulations show that hyporheic exchange occurs in covered channels which have shallower hyporheic zones and larger hyporheic fluxes than equivalent‐depth equivalent‐discharge uncovered channels. We also analyzed hyporheic exchange for the case of freely floating covers with rough undersides and found that hyporheic exchange decreases with increasing cover roughness which in turn is driven by subdued bed topography, a response to additional resistance due to covers. The results suggest that hyporheic exchange occurs in covered channels and may be just as or perhaps more important to the ecology and biogeochemistry of these channels than to open channel streams.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2007WR006506",""

Molecular Tagging Velocimetry (MTV) is used to obtain the multiple point measurement of the instantaneous velocity field. MTV is a molecular counterpart of PIV based techniques, and it eliminates the use of seed particles. A two-dimensional velocity field is obtained at various crank angle degrees (CADs) for tumble and swirl measurement planes inside an optical engine assembly [1500 and 2500 rpm engine speeds]. Effects of charge motion control are studied considering different cases of: (i) Charge motion control valve (CMCV) deactivated and (ii) CMCV activated. Both the measurement planes are used in each case to study the cycle-to-cycle variability inside an engine cylinder. Probability density functions (PDFs) of the normalized circulation (NC) are calculated from the instantaneous planar velocity to quantify the cycle-to-cycle variations of in-cylinder flows. Different geometries of CMCV produce different effects on the in-cylinder flow field. It is found that the CMCV used in this work has a profound effect on fuel-air mixing; however, its influence is not as significant during the late compression. Therefore, it can be assumed that CMCV has less contribution to enhance the flame speed during the combustion process.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2008-66490/2724704/819_1.pdf",""

Based on this analysis, the multi-interface service is designed to allocate service activities to the interfaces best suited to provide the desired experience, defining channel specialization and integration. Finally, with the SEB method each service interface is designed to best leverage its unique capabilities and guide customers to other service interfaces whenever that interface better enhances the overall customer experience.

We simulate rupture for models of faults with a kink (a sharp change in fault strike), examining how off‐fault plastic yielding affects rupture propagation, seismic radiation, and near‐fault strain distribution. We find that high‐frequency radiation from a kink can be reduced by strong plastic yielding near the kink. The reduction is significant above several Hz. When rupture propagates around the kink onto a less favorably stressed fault segment, plastic strain tends to localize into bands and lobes. Off‐fault plastic yielding also significantly reduces heterogeneity of residual stresses around the kink following a dynamic event. The calculated plastic strain distribution around the kink and the radiated pulse from the kink are nearly grid independent over the range of element size for which computations are feasible. We also find that plastic strain can sometimes localize spontaneously during rupture along a planar fault, in the absence of a discrete stress concentrator like the kink.

Method: Two hundred sixteen children between the ages of 6 and 9 years with language impairments were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 conditions: (a) Fast ForWord Language (FFW-L), (b) academic enrichment (AE), (c) computer-assisted language intervention (CALI), or (d) individualized language intervention (ILI) provided by a speech-language pathologist. All children received 1 hr and 40 min of treatment, 5 days per week, for 6 weeks. Language and auditory processing measures were administered to the children by blinded examiners before treatment, immediately after treatment, 3 months after treatment, and 6 months after treatment. Results: The children in all 4 conditions improved significantly on a global language test and a test of backward masking. Children with poor backward masking scores who were randomized to the FFW-L condition did not present greater improvement on the language measures than children with poor backward masking scores who were randomized to the other 3 conditions. Effect sizes, analyses of standard error of measurement, and normalization percentages supported the clinical significance of the improvements on the Comprehensive Assessment of Spoken Language (E. Carrow-Woolfolk, 1999). There was a treatment effect for the Blending Words subtest of the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (R. K. Wagner, J. K. Torgesen, & C. A. Rashotte, 1999). Participants in the FFW-L and CALI conditions earned higher phonological awareness scores than children in the ILI and AE conditions at the 6-month follow-up testing. Conclusion: Fast ForWord Language, the intervention that provided modified speech to address a hypothesized underlying auditory processing deficit, was not more effective at improving general language skills or temporal processing skills than a nonspecific comparison treatment (AE) or specific language intervention comparison treatments (CALI and ILI) that did not contain modified speech stimuli. These findings call into question the temporal processing hypothesis of language impairment and the hypothesized benefits of using acoustically modified speech to improve language skills. The finding that children in the 3 treatment conditions and the active comparison condition made clinically relevant gains on measures of language and temporal auditory processing informs our understanding of the variety of intervention activities that can facilitate development.","http://pubs.asha.org/doi/pdf/10.1044/1092-4388%282008/007%29",""

This study extends both areas of research by incorporating R&D tax credits from stock option exercises into the R&D spending decision. We find evidence that firms reduce R&D spending by 0.46 percent of total assets to avoid earnings decreases, but R&D tax credits generated by stock option exercises offset this decrease by 16 percent on average and up to 42 percent for a fully taxable firm.

Background: During the past three decades, much of the empirical warnings research has been published in human factors and ergonomics (HF/E) literature. A major impetus to that research has been concurrent activity by HF/E professionals participating as expert witnesses in product liability and personal injury cases in which there is a claim of failure to adequately warn about associated hazards. Method: We review how the issues in forensics can identify researchable questions. This effort has prompted important questions to be addressed that have resulted in publications. Two examples are provided: vehicle seat recline and explicitness. Results: The research has contributed to theory and model building of the processing involved. The research prompted by practical forensic issues can contribute to knowledge that is not limited in scope to particular instances, as is sometimes ascribed to applied research; it can also offer confirmatory support for theory or its modification.

No statistically significant differences were found on either variable in comparisons of experimental and control group responses. However, students from both groups exhibited positive environmental attitudes. Demographic comparisons indicated that children with previous gardening experience scored significantly higher on the environmental attitude and environmental locus of control statements when compared with children without gardening experience.

The Observations Data Model presented here provides a new and consistent format for the storage and retrieval of point environmental observations in a relational database designed to facilitate integrated analysis of large data sets collected by multiple investigators. Within this data model, observations are stored with sufficient ancillary information (metadata) about the observations to allow them to be unambiguously interpreted and to provide traceable heritage from raw measurements to useable information. The design is based upon a relational database model that exposes each single observation as a record, taking advantage of the capability in relational database systems for querying based upon data values and enabling cross‐dimension data retrieval and analysis. This paper presents the design principles and features of the Observations Data Model and illustrates how it can be used to enhance the organization, publication, and analysis of point observations data while retaining a simple relational format. The contribution of the data model to water resources is that it represents a new, systematic way to organize and share data that overcomes many of the syntactic and semantic differences between heterogeneous data sets, thereby facilitating an integrated understanding of water resources based on more extensive and fully specified information.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2007WR006392",""

Blake Ridge, one of the largest passive margin gas hydrate provinces on Earth, is traditionally characterized as an expansive yet dilute reservoir of methane hydrate with no significant fluid advection. Previous 2‐D seismic analysis and Ocean Drilling Program Leg 164 drilling results show evidence for both concentrated zones of hydrate and possible fluid flow; however, the extent of these phenomena remains ambiguous. Here we analyze high‐resolution 3‐D seismic data collected at Blake Ridge in 2000 and map seismic indicators of concentrated hydrate and fluid flow. We also use the seismic data to map the base of the gas hydrate stability in 3‐D. Our analysis demonstrates that the gas hydrate phase boundary varies significantly in areas of high sedimentation and erosion, suggesting a dynamic hydrate system. Furthermore, evidence of localized bottom‐simulating reflector shoaling, particularly at a sediment wave bounding surface, indicates ongoing advection. The analysis reveals that the Blake Ridge gas hydrate system is significantly more dynamic than previous studies suggest, and we hypothesize that fluctuating sedimentation and erosion patterns cause hydrate phase‐boundary instability that triggers fluid flow.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2007JB005392",""

When inverting time-lapse ERT data, it is useful to proceed beyond straightforward inversion of data differences and take advantage of the time-lapse nature of the data. We assess various approaches for inverting and interpreting time-lapse ERT data and determine that two approaches work well. The first approach is model subtraction after separate inversion of the data from two time periods, and the second approach is to use the inverted model from a base data set as the reference model or prior information for subsequent time periods. We prefer this second approach. Data inversion methodology should be consideredwhen designing data acquisition; i.e., to utilize the second approach, it is important to collect one or more data sets for which the bulk of the subsurface is in a background or relatively unperturbed state. A third and commonly used approach to time-lapse inversion, inverting the difference between two data sets, localizes the regions of the model in which change has occurred; however, varying noise levels between the two data sets can be problematic. To further assess the various time-lapse inversion approaches, we acquired field data from a catchment within the Dry Creek Experimental Watershed near Boise, Idaho, U.S.A. We combined the complimentary information from individual static ERT inversions, time-lapse ERT images, and available hydrologic data in a robust interpretation scheme to aid in quantifying seasonal variations in subsurface moisture content.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/1.2907156",""

Independent judges then determined the accuracy of the recalled information in both a rating task and a matching task. Results revealed reliably higher accuracy scores for the descriptions over the facial composites but showed no evidence for an own-race bias. A second experiment (N = 120) was conducted to attempt to replicate the description-advantage effect and to further explore the own-race bias in a stronger test using Black faces as the cross-ethnic group. This experiment again showed a description advantage and provided some evidence for an own-race bias in recall similar to that found in the facial recognition literature.

As a counter-defense, the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 uses the virulence factor coronatine to actively open stomata. In nature, many foliar bacterial disease outbreaks require high humidity, rain, or storms, which could favor stomatal opening and/or bypass stomatal defense by creating wounds as alternative entry sites.

Analysis of infrared reflection data shows that the formation of ordered α′-Zn4Sb3 is accompanied by a substantial increase in the free charge-carrier concentration. In contrast, for samples where doping suppresses the occurrence of the low temperature α′-phase, the free charge-carrier concentration is only weakly temperature dependent.

Two families of basis sets, nonrelativistic and Douglas–Kroll–Hess relativistic, are used that range in quality from triple-ζ to quintuple-ζ. These are augmented by additional diffuse functions (on fluorine atoms) and tight functions (on all atoms) for the description of core-valence correlation and utilized to determine complete basis set molecular properties. The quality of electron correlation treatment using conventional single reference coupled cluster methods CCSD and CCSD(T) is compared to that attained at the multiconfigurational quasidegenerate second-order perturbation theory (CASSCF+MCQDPT2) and the electron attachment equation-of-motion coupled cluster (EOMEA-CCSD) levels. Spin-orbit coupling effects are studied by the SO-MCQDPT2 method using the full Breit–Pauli spin-orbit operator. Effects of spin contamination in the coupled cluster molecular calculations are carefully analyzed. Results of the single reference CCSD(T) and multireference calculations are found to be in a remarkable agreement. The calculations indicate that the EOMEA-CC approach provides a suitable tool for an accurate treatment of FeF2 and other systems where delicate electron correlation effects have to be carefully dealt with. The inclusion of relativistic effects is shown to be necessary for an accurate description of the molecular geometry and excitation energies of FeF2.

However, traditional expected value methods (such as annual loss expectancy) cannot fully characterize the information security risk confronted by organizations, considering some extremal yet perhaps relatively rare cases in which a security failure may be critical and cause high losses. In this research note we introduce the concept of value-at-risk to measure the risk of daily losses an organization faces due to security exploits and use extreme value analysis to quantitatively estimate the value at risk. We collect a set of internal daily activity data from a large financial institution in the northeast United States and then simulate its daily losses with information based on data snapshots and interviews with security managers at the institution. We illustrate our methods using these simulated daily losses. With this approach, decision makers can make a proper investment choice based on their own risk preference instead of pursuing a solution that minimizes only the expected cost.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/isre.1070.0143",""

Since that time, several stereoscopic media, which are applicable to introductory-level physics and astronomy classes, have been developed and released into the public domain. In addition to the GeoWall's application in the classroom, there is considerable value in its use as part of a general science outreach program.

In this study, we investigated if near infrared ultrashort laser pulses produced DNA damage by exciting short wavelength-absorbing chromophores via multiphoton absorption. The experiments were carried out in nonpigmented and artificially pigmented hTERT-RPE cells, a line of human-derived retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Cells were exposed to 0.25 s pulses of CW and mode-locked 810 nm laser emissions, at irradiances equivalent to 0.5 and 1.0 times the ED50 for threshold damage in the primate eye, and DNA strand breaks were measured using the comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis). At 0.5 X ED50, increased DNA strand breakage occurred after the ultrashort (mode-locked) exposures, but not the CW exposures, compared to control cells. At 1.0 X ED50, both the mode-locked- and CW-exposed cells exhibited increased DNA damage, compared to controls. These differences, although significant, were inconsistent, because they were found only in the comet assay tail length parameter, but not the tail moment parameter. Moreover, the amount of DNA strand breakage was clearly dependent on the amount of melanin pigmentation in the cells, regardless of laser pulsewidth. A theoretical analysis found that the number of photons delivered to the RPE melanosome during a single 33–250 fs pulse, at an irradiance equivalent to the ED50, was insufficient to produce multiphoton excitation. In addition, the equivalent DNA strand breakage in pigmented RPE cells after ultrashort and CW exposures indicated that multiphoton absorption is not a major contributor to the ultrashort pulse laser damage threshold in the near infrared optical spectrum.","https://pubs.aip.org/lia/jla/article-pdf/20/2/89/12109534/89_1_online.pdf",""

They have become completely dependent on information—generating, exchanging, and processing far more electronic data than ever before. They have become geographically dispersed organizations that comprise numerous, tightly interconnected networks of diverse companies. As a result, current-day industrial systems exhibit highly nonlinear, chaotic, and unpredictable behaviors. How best to engineer these new systems is a question of both theoretical and practical importance. Albert Einstein believed that you cannot use old approaches to solve new, and fundamentally different, problems. (“We cannot solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.”) That old approach, Descartes’ reductionism, said that you could infer the behavior of the entire system by knowing only the behavior of its components. This view is not valid for these new systems, because their behavior emerges in complex ways from the interactions of those components. Therefore, in this paper, we argue that a different approach to engineering these new types of industrial systems is needed. We base that approach on our view that these systems are remarkably similar to living systems. In this paper, we describe the major characteristics of living systems, summarize their similarities with these new systems, and use these similarities as a basis for a new research agenda.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/computingengineering/article-pdf/doi/10.1115/1.2844398/5694067/011005_1.pdf",""

This undesirable side‐effect is attributable to LXRα, thus the identification of LXRβ‐selective agonists is crucial to improving the therapeutic potential of synthetic agonists. Our goal is to identify novel regulatory mechanisms responsible for modulating LXR activity. We have created inducible cell lines expressing epitope‐tagged LXRα and LXRβ. Cells expressing LXRα and LXRβ exhibited a 10‐ and 2‐fold activation, respectively, of an idealized reporter, indicating that these proteins were functional. Interestingly, treatment with either the synthetic LXR ligand T1317 or 24(S),25‐epoxycholesterol increased LXRβ protein abundance, whereas LXRα was unchanged. Treatment with a RXR agonist did not alter the abundance of either protein, suggesting enhanced stability is not dependent on transactivation of the RXR/LXR heterodimer. In summary, we have identified a ligand‐dependent mechanism through which LXRβ protein stability is regulated, which will further our understanding of these sterol sensors in regulating reverse‐cholesterol transport and decreasing the risk of cardiovascular disease.","",""

The representation scheme can enable reasoning to take place, or it may make the desired reasoning impossible. To some extent, the knowledge representation depends upon the underlying technology. For instance, in order to perform default reasoning with exceptions, one needs weak negation (aka negation as failure. In fact, most complex forms of reasoning will require weak negation.

This article suggests a different paradigm for expert systems than what is commonly used. Most often, expert systems are developed with a tool called an “expert system shell.” For the more adventurous, an expert system might be developed with Prolog, a language for artificial intelligence. Both Prolog and expert system shells stem from technology that is approximately 30 years old.1 There have been updates to these platforms, such as GUI interfaces, XML interfaces, and other “bells and whistles.” However, the technology is still fundamentally old. As an analogy, the current technology is akin to updating a 30-year-old car with new paint (a gooey interface), new upholstery, GPS, and so forth. However, the car is fundamentally still a 30-year-old car. It may be in far better shape than another 30-year-old car without the updates, but it cannot compete from an engineering perspective with current models.2 Similarly, the reasoning power of current expert system technology cannot compete with the reasoning power of the state of the art in logic programming. These advances that have taken place in the logic programming community since the advent of Prolog and expert system shells include: a well developed theory of multiple forms of negation, an understanding of open domains, and the closed world assumption, default reasoning with exceptions, reasoning with respect to time (i.e., a solution to the frame problem and introspection with regard to previous beliefs), reasoning about actions, introspection, and maintaining multiple views of the world simultaneously (i.e., reasoning with uncertainty). This article examines a family of logic programming languages. This article in conjunction with a companion article this volume, Knowledge Representation That Can Empower Expert Systems, suggest that logic programs employing recent advances in semantics and in knowledge representation provide a more robust framework in which to develop expert systems. The author has successfully applied this paradigm and these ideas to financial applications, security applications, and enterprise information systems.","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=11299",""

Despite widespread use of shaped holes, existing correlations for predicting performance are limited to narrow ranges of parameters. This study extends the prediction capability for shaped holes through the development of a physics-based empirical correlation for predicting laterally-averaged film-cooling effectiveness on a flat plate downstream of a row of shaped film-cooling holes. Existing data was used to determine the physical relationship between film-cooling effectiveness and several parameters, including; blowing ratio, hole coverage ratio, area ratio, and hole spacing. Those relationships were then incorporated into the skeleton form of an empirical correlation, using results from the literature to determine coefficients for the correlation. Predictions from the current correlation, as well as existing shaped hole correlations and a cylindrical hole correlation were compared to the existing experimental data. Results show that the current physics-based correlation yields a significant improvement in predictive capability, by expanding the valid parameter range and improving agreement with experimental data. Particularly significant is the inclusion of higher blowing ratio conditions (up to M = 2.5) into the current correlation, whereas the existing correlations worked adequately only at lower blowing ratios (M ≈ 0.5).","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/GT/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/GT2008-50121/2687271/65_1.pdf",""

To define whether chloride availability to PMNs affects their HOCl production and microbicidal capacity, we examined how extracellular chloride concentration affects killing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PsA) by normal neutrophils. PMN-mediated bacterial killing was strongly dependent on extracellular chloride concentration. Neutrophils in a chloride-deficient medium killed PsA poorly. However, as the chloride level was raised, the killing efficiency increased in a dose-dependent manner. By using specific inhibitors to selectively block NADPH oxidase, MPO, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) functions, neutrophil-mediated killing of PsA could be attributed to three distinct mechanisms: CFTR-dependent and oxidant-dependent; chloride-dependent but not CFTR- and oxidant-dependent; and independent of any of the tested factors. Therefore, chloride anion is involved in oxidant- and nonoxidant-mediated bacterial killing. We previously reported that neutrophils from CF patients are defective in chlorination of ingested bacteria [1], suggesting that the chloride channel defect might impair the MPO-hydrogen peroxide-chloride microbicidal function. Here, we compared the competence of killing PsA by neutrophils from normal donors and CF patients. The data demonstrate that the killing rate by CF neutrophils was significantly lower than that by normal neutrophils. CF neutrophils in a chloride-deficient environment had only one-third of the bactericidal capacity of normal neutrophils in a physiological chloride environment. These results suggest that CFTR-dependent chloride anion transport contributes significantly to killing PsA by normal neutrophils and when defective as in CF, may compromise the ability to clear PsA.","https://academic.oup.com/jleukbio/article-pdf/83/6/1345/49635341/jlb1345.pdf",""

The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce principles that enhance motor learning for nonspeech motor skills and to examine the extent to which these principles apply in treatment of motor speech disorders. Method: This tutorial critically reviews various principles in the context of nonspeech motor learning by reviewing selected literature from the major journals in motor learning. The potential application of these principles to speech motor learning is then discussed by reviewing relevant literature on treatment of speech disorders. Specific attention is paid to how these principles may be incorporated into treatment for motor speech disorders. Conclusions: Evidence from nonspeech motor learning suggests that various principles may interact with each other and differentially affect diverse aspects of movements. Whereas few studies have directly examined these principles in speech motor (re)learning, available evidence suggests that these principles hold promise for treatment of motor speech disorders. Further research is necessary to determine which principles apply to speech motor (re)learning in impaired populations.","http://pubs.asha.org/doi/pdf/10.1044/1058-0360%282008/025%29",""

Fair-weather cumulus clouds produce up to 1 K day−1 of heating below 850 hPa and are associated with cooling throughout much of the rest of the troposphere. Cumulus congestus clouds produce heating on the order of 1 K day−1 up to 575 hPa and cooling in the mid- to upper troposphere. Cumulonimbus clouds produce heating through the depth of the troposphere, with a maximum of 3.7 K day−1 near 550 hPa. Cloud types indicating widespread rain (stratus or cumulus fractus of bad weather at low levels and nimbostratus at midlevels) have the largest and most elevated heating, with values &gt;10 K day−1 above 600 hPa.

The purpose of this review was to assess the 9 cross-sectional and 12 longitudinal studies that have looked at this association. Of the 9 cross-sectional studies reviewed, only 3 reported any association. Those studies used small, local convenience samples of preschool children; furthermore, selection criteria were not well defined. One found that preschool children consuming ≥ 12 fluid oz/day of 100% fruit juice had a higher prevalence of overweight than those who consumed less than 12 oz/day (32% vs 9%). Later, a separate study showed that this relationship held only for apple juice. Another study demonstrated an association of overweight and energy from juice. These 3 studies were not nationally representative. Only 3 of the longitudinal studies showed an association between 100% fruit juice consumption and weight; 1 found an association only in adolescent girls, and 2 reported an association in children who were already overweight. None of the longitudinal studies was nationally representative, but 5 had sample sizes of at least 1000, 2 were ethnically diverse, and 3 had geographically separate sites, suggesting that the findings could be applicable to wider populations. Based on the currently available evidence, it can be concluded that there is no systematic association between consumption of 100% fruit juice and overweight in children or adolescents. Data do support consumption of 100% fruit juice in moderate amounts and suggest that consumption of 100% fruit juice may be an important strategy to help children meet the current recommendations for fruit.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1559827608317277",""

At that time Darcy turned over, to Dupuit, his position as Director of Water and Bridges in Paris and the research on pipe flow he had begun there in 1849. In these pipe flow experiments, Darcy discovered what he referred to as a “law” of fluid mechanics, which is that above a certain velocity threshold, the head loss is proportional to velocity squared, and below that threshold, the head loss is linearly proportional to velocity. During the remainder of their careers, Darcy and Dupuit applied this law with their collective, extensive, prior knowledge of fluid mechanics, geology, aquifers, wells, and springs to quantitative studies of fluid flow in the subsurface (and also in pipes, aqueducts, rivers, and sand filters). Two monographs by Darcy (1856) and Dupuit (1857) are mutually cited retrospectives on much of this research, submitted at nearly the same time, to the same Corps des Ponts et Chaussées publisher, near the end of their careers. Between these two monographs, many of the fundamentals of quantitative hydrogeology were established, including the equation for groundwater motion, average linear velocity, average travel time, effective hydraulic conductivity for layered heterogeneity, conservation of mass in confined and unconfined flow, the nature of the regional pieziometric surface, porous flow versus flow through discrete fractures and karst conduits, the equation for a cone of depression around flowing wells, superposition of the effects of multiple wells, and capture zone geometries of wells within a regional flow field.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2008WR007002",""

Relative luminescence efficiency values are presented for 19 primary charge/energy combinations, plus 31 additional charge/energy combinations obtained by introducing absorbers in the primary beam. Our results show that for energies of hundreds of MeV/u the data can be described by a single curve of relative luminescence efficiency versus linear energy transfer (LET). This information is needed to compensate for the reduced OSL efficiency to high-LET particles in such applications as space dosimetry. For lower energies, the relative luminescence efficiency as function of LET cannot be described by a single curve; instead, it separates into different components corresponding to different particles. We also present data on the low-LET dose response of Al2O3:C, measured under the same experimental conditions in which the relative luminescence efficiencies to HCPs were obtained, providing information relevant to future theoretical investigations of HCP energy deposition and luminescence production in Al2O3:C.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.3041655/15034717/124903_1_online.pdf",""

Objective:: To examine attitudes of athletic trainers (ATs) and physical therapists (PTs) on the effectiveness of mental imagery, goal setting, and positive self-talk to improve rehabilitation adherence and recovery speed of injured athletes. Design:: The ATs and PTs were contacted via electronic or physical mailings to complete a single administration survey that measured their beliefs about the effectiveness of psychological skills for increasing adherence and recovery speed of injured athletes undergoing rehabilitation. Setting:: Professional member databases of the National Athletic Trainers' Association and the American Physical Therapy Association. Patients or Other Participants:: Of the 1000 ATs and 1000 PTs who were selected randomly, 309 ATs (age  =  34.18 ± 8.32 years, years in profession  =  10.67 ± 7.34) and 356 PTs (age  =  38.58 ± 7.51 years, years in profession  =  13.18 ± 6.17) responded. Main Outcome Measure(s):: The Attitudes About Imagery (AAI) survey measures attitudes about psychological skills for enhancing adherence and recovery speed of injured athletes. The AAI includes demographic questions and 15 items on a 7-point Likert scale measuring attitudes about the effectiveness of mental imagery, self-talk, goal setting, and pain control on rehabilitation adherence and recovery speed of injured athletes. Test-retest reliability ranged from .60 to .84 and Cronbach αs ranged from .65 to .90.

In addition, ATs held more positive attitudes than PTs on 9 of 15 AAI items (P &lt; .05). Conclusions:: Overall, ATs and PTs held positive attitudes on the effectiveness of psychological skills to augment the rehabilitation process. Clinical implications regarding the use of mental skills are discussed.","http://meridian.allenpress.com/jat/article-pdf/43/3/258/1453883/1062-6050-43_3_258.pdf",""

This method combines the interpolation of daily ratios/fractions derived from ground-based meteorological station records and respective fields of monthly estimates. Data sources for the described implementation over the conterminous United States (CONUS) are two independent and quality-controlled inputs: 1) an enhanced compilation of daily observations derived from the National Climatic Data Center digital archives and 2) the Parameter–Elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) maps. The results of this study show that this nonconventional interpolation preserves the spatial and temporal distribution of both the PRISM maps (monthly, topography-sensitive patterns) and the original daily observations. Statistics of a preliminary point comparison with the observed values at high-quality and independent reference sites show a reasonable agreement and a noticeable improvement over the nearest station method in orographically sensitive areas. The implemented datasets provide daily precipitation and temperature values at 2.5-min (around 4 km) resolution for 1960–2001. Combining seamless spatial and temporal coverage and topographic sensitivity characteristics, the datasets offer the potential for supporting current and future regional and historical hydrologic assessments over the CONUS.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jamc/article-pdf/47/2/475/3542232/2007jamc1356_1.pdf",""

Its activity is regulated in vivo by a naturally occurring antagonist, the human IL-18-binding protein (IL-18BP). Functional homologs of human IL-18BP are encoded by all orthopoxviruses, including variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox. They contribute to virulence by suppressing IL-18-mediated immune responses. Here, we describe the 2.0-Å resolution crystal structure of an orthopoxvirus IL-18BP, ectromelia virus IL-18BP (ectvIL-18BP), in complex with hIL-18. The hIL-18 structure in the complex shows significant conformational change at the binding interface compared with the structure of ligand-free hIL-18, indicating that the binding is mediated by an induced-fit mechanism. EctvIL-18BP adopts a canonical Ig fold and interacts via one edge of its β-sandwich with 3 cavities on the hIL-18 surface through extensive hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions. Most of the ectvIL-18BP residues that participate in these interactions are conserved in both human and viral homologs, explaining their functional equivalence despite limited sequence homology. EctvIL-18BP blocks a putative receptor-binding site on IL-18, thus preventing IL-18 from engaging its receptor. Our structure provides insights into how IL-18BPs modulate hIL-18 activity. The revealed binding interface provides the basis for rational design of inhibitors against orthopoxvirus IL-18BP (for treating orthopoxvirus infection) or hIL-18 (for treating certain inflammatory and autoimmune diseases).","https://pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.0809086106",""

Chemical compositions and mineralogy show that samples were collected from two deposit types: Fe‐Mn crusts of mixed hydrogenetic/hydrothermal origin and hydrothermal Mn oxide deposits; this paper addresses only the second type. Mn oxides cement volcaniclastic and biogenic sandstone and breccia layers (Mn sandstone) and form discrete dense stratabound layers along bedding planes and within beds (stratabound Mn). The Mn oxide was deposited within coarse‐grained sediments from diffuse flow systems where precipitation occurred below the seafloor. Deposits were exposed at the seabed by faulting, mass wasting, and erosion. Scanning electron microscopy and microprobe analyses indicate the presence of both amorphous and crystalline 10 Å and 7 Å manganate minerals, the fundamental chemical difference being high water contents in the amorphous Mn oxides. Alternation of amorphous and crystalline laminae occurs in many samples, which likely resulted from initial rapid precipitation of amorphous Mn oxides from waxing pulses of hydrothermal fluids followed by precipitation of slow forming crystallites during waning stages. The chemical composition is characteristic of a hydrothermal origin including strong fractionation between Fe (mean 0.9 wt %) and Mn (mean 48 wt %) for the stratabound Mn, generally low trace metal contents, and very low rare earth element and platinum group element contents. However, Mo, Cd, Zn, Cu, Ni, and Co occur in high concentrations in some samples and may be good indicator elements for proximity to the heat source or to massive sulfide deposits. For the Mn sandstones, Fe (mean 8.4%) and Mn (12.4%) are not significantly fractionated because of high Fe contents in the volcaniclastic material. However, the proportion of hydrothermal Fe (nondetrital Fe) to total Fe is remarkably constant (49–58%) for all the sample groups, regardless of the degree of Mn mineralization. Factor analyses indicate various mixtures of two dominant components: hydrothermal Mn oxide for the stratabound Mn and detrital aluminosilicate for the Mn‐cemented sandstone; and two minor components, hydrothermal Fe oxyhydroxide and biocarbonate/biosilica. Our conceptual model shows that Mn mineralization was produced by hydrothermal convection cells within arc volcanoes and sedimentary prisms that occur along the flanks and within calderas. The main source of hydrothermal fluid was seawater that penetrated through fractures, faults, and permeable volcanic edifices. The fluids were heated by magma, enriched in metals by leaching of basement rocks and sediments, and mixed with magmatic fluids and gases. Dikes and sills may have been another source of heat that drove small‐scale circulation within sedimentary prisms.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2007JB005432",""

However, few studies have investigated its QS related antivirulent activities. Our objective was to screen for the QS inhibitory properties of 16 high quality ayurvedic medicinal plants derived from Indian sub‐continent, understand their mechanism of action and investigate their effect on the expression of QS regulated virulence factors in PAO1. QS inhibition of sub‐lethal concentrations (SLC) of plant extracts was measured in violacein producing Chromobacterium violaceum bioassay model. Effect of these extracts on PAO1 virulent factors pyocyanin, elastase, and total protease were quantified by standard protocols. Results indicated that all extracts reduced violacein production significantly. The results from modified screening assay suggested the primary mechanism of QSI was a combination of (1) reduction in AI formation and (2) inhibition of AI activity.

This review is divided into six sections. The first summarizes the literature on assessment of dental students’ performance. Section two discusses catalysts, with a focus on problem‐based learning, for development of new assessment methods, while the third section presents several resources and guides that can be used to inform selection of assessment techniques for various domains of competence. The fourth section describes the methodology and results of a 2008 survey of current assessment practices in U.S. dental schools. In the fifth section, findings from this survey are discussed within the context of competency‐based education, the educational model for the predoctoral curriculum endorsed by the American Dental Education Association and prescribed by the Commission on Dental Accreditation. The article concludes with a summary of assessments recommended as optimal strategies to measure three components of professional competence based on the triangulation model. The survey of assessment practices in predoctoral education was completed by 931 course directors, representing 45 percent of course directors nationwide, from fifty‐three of the fifty‐six U.S. dental schools. Survey findings indicate that five traditional mainstays of student performance evaluation—multiple‐choice testing, lab practicals, daily grades, clinical competency exams, and procedural requirements—still comprise the primary assessment tools in dental education. The survey revealed that a group of newer assessment techniques, although frequently identified as best practices in the literature and commonly used in other areas of health professions education, are rarely employed in predoctoral dental education.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fj.0022-0337.2008.72.12.tb04620.x",""

The authors argue that intervention by third parties is central to the civil war process, a process that is characterized by the duration of hostilities and the type of outcome. The authors examine empirically the effect of third-party intervention into civil wars during the period 1816—1997, using the event history framework of competing risks. From the perspective of competing risks, as a civil war endures, it is at risk of experiencing a transition to one of three civil war outcomes in our sample: military victory by the government, military victory by the opposition group, and negotiated settlement. The competing risks approach provides considerably better leverage on the dynamic qualities of civil wars and, in particular, the influence of interventions by third parties. The analysis suggests that third-party interventions can be decisive in the evolution of civil wars and that third-party interventions have a different effect on the duration than different civil war outcomes. The results show that third-party intervention decreases the time until the supported group achieves military victory. Furthermore, third-party interventions, on both the government and opposition sides, increase the time until a negotiated settlement.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0022343308088815",""

However, there are also many common, highly susceptible Quercus species—a characteristic typical of introduced pathogens.

METHODS: A prospective, intention-to-treat, multicenter registry of Wingspan treatment for symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease was maintained. Clinical and angiographic follow-up results were recorded. ISR was defined as greater than 50% stenosis within or immediately adjacent (within 5 mm) to the implanted stent(s) and greater than 20% absolute luminal loss. ISR lesions were classified by angiographic pattern, location, and severity in comparison with the original lesion treated. RESULTS: Imaging follow-up (3–15.5 months) was available for 127 intracranial stenotic lesions treated with Wingspan percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with stenting. Forty-one lesions (32.3%) developed either ISR (n = 36 [28.3%]) or complete stent occlusion (n = 5 [3.9%]) after treatment. When restenotic lesions were characterized using the modified classification system, 25 of 41 (61.0%) were focal lesions involving less than 50% of the length of the stented segment: three were Type IA (focal stenosis involving one end of the stent), 21 were Type IB (focal intrastent stenosis involving a segment completely contained within the stent), and one was Type IC (multiple noncontiguous focal stenoses). Eleven lesions (26.8%) demonstrated diffuse stenosis (&gt;50% of the length of the stented segment): nine were Type II with diffuse intrastent stenosis (completely contained within the stent) and two were Type III with proliferative ISR (extending beyond the stented segment). Five stents were completely occluded at follow-up (Type IV). Of the 36 ISR lesions, 16 were less severe or no worse than the original lesion with respect to severity of stenosis or length of the segment involved; 20 lesions were more severe than the original lesion with respect to the segment length involved (n = 5), actual stenosis severity (n = 6), or both (n = 9). Nine of 10 supraclinoid internal carotid artery ISR lesions and nine of 13 middle cerebral artery ISR lesions were more severe than the original lesion. CONCLUSION: Wingspan ISR typically occurs as a focal lesion. In more than half of ISR cases, the ISR lesion was more extensive than the original lesion treated in terms of lesion length or stenosis severity. Supraclinoid internal carotid artery and middle cerebral artery lesions have a propensity to develop more severe posttreatment stenosis.","http://academic.oup.com/neurosurgery/article-pdf/63/1/23/32583589/neurosurgery-63-1-23.pdf",""

To characterize the effect of increased energy expenditure on regulatory proteins associated with both the insulin and mTOR signaling pathway we examined these proteins while in the fasting state. Soleus muscle was collected from 4 male Sprague‐Dawley sedentary rats and from 5 rats exposed to 8 weeks of free access to running wheels. We utilized immunoblotting methods to measure phosphorylation status and total protein abundance of mTOR, 4E‐BP1, Akt/PKB, S6K1, IRS‐1, TSC2 and AS160. Rats exposed to the chronic increase in energy expenditure tended to have a lower body weight as compared to sedentary rats (336±13g vs 356±30g, P=0.09), and soleus muscle weights were similar between groups (P>0.05). The phosphorylation status of S6K1 (Thr389), AKT/PKB (Ser473) and AS160 (Ser/Thr) were significantly reduced with an increase in energy expenditure (P<0.05). Phosphorylation of TSC2, 4E‐BP1, and IRS‐1 (Ser636/639) were unchanged. The total protein abundance of mTOR, S6K1, 4E‐BP1, Akt/PKB, TSC2, AS160 and IRS‐1 were unaffected with chronic energy expenditure (P>0.05).

DEVS-FIRE is based on the discrete event system specification (DEVS) and uses a cellular space model for simulating wildfire spread and agent models for simulating wildfire containment. The cellular space model incorporates real spatial fuels data, terrain data and temporal weather data into the prediction of wildfire behavior across both time and space. DEVS-FIRE is designed to be integrated with stochastic optimization models that use the scenario results from the simulation to determine an optimal mix of firefighting resources to dispatch to a wildfire. Preliminary computational experiments with fuel, terrain and weather data for a real forest demonstrate the viability of the integrated simulation environment for wildfire spread and containment.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0037549708094047",""

This paper presents a UML-based approach to testing whether or not an aspect-oriented program conforms to its expected crosscutting behavior. We explore aspect-oriented UML design models to derive tests for exercising interactions between aspects and classes. Each aspect-oriented model consists of class diagrams, aspect diagrams, and sequence diagrams. For a method under test, we weave the sequence diagrams of the advice on the method into the method's sequence diagram. Based on the woven sequence diagram and class/aspect diagrams, we then generate an AOF (Aspect-Object Flow) tree by applying coverage criteria such as condition coverage, polymorphic coverage, and loop coverage to woven sequence diagrams. In the AOF tree, each path from the root to a leaf is an abstract message sequence, indicating a template of test cases. A concrete test case is obtained by creating objects that satisfy the collective constraints in the template. Our empirical study shows that the model-based testing approach is capable of revealing several types of aspect-specific faults, including incorrect advice type, incorrect (weaker or stronger) pointcut strengths, and incorrect aspect precedence.","https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S0218194008003672",""

There has been a conjecture that a coordinated response exists at the crypt level, i.e. that biological responses in one crypt affects the biological responses in neighboring crypts. P27Kip1 (p27) is a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, which arrests cell cycle progression and induces apoptosis. We hypothesized if a crypt has high p27 expression, the neighboring crypts are likely to have high p27 expression. To test the hypothesis, 20 colonic crypts in each of 12 rats were analyzed for p27 levels and the distance between the crypts were measured. The correlation between the p27 expression between the crypts were analyzed using Bayesian statistical methods. The correlation at 25 μm was 0.57 and the correlation was positive for distances up to 400 μm (p<0.05). The closer crypts were to one another the better the correlation. This observation supports the existence of inter‐crypt signaling; p27 expression in crypts which are in close proximity tend to have similar expression levels. This type of inter‐crypt signaling may be responsible for the formation of aberrant crypt foci, polyps and eventually colon adenomas. This spatial analysis is a novel mathematical approach to study of colon carcinogenesis. Funded by NIH (CA61750, CA82907, CA59034), NSBRI NASA NCC 9–58 and NIEHS P30‐ES09106.","",""

CLM3.0 has known biases in the surface energy partitioning as a result of deficiencies in its hydrological and biophysical parameterizations. Such models, however, need to be robust for multidecadal global climate simulations. FLUXNET now provides an extensive data source of carbon, water and energy exchanges for investigating land processes, and it encompasses a global range of ecosystem‐climate interactions. Data from 15 FLUXNET sites are used to identify and improve model deficiencies. Including a prognostic aquifer, a bare soil evaporation resistance formulation and numerous other changes in the model result in a significantly improved soil hydrology and energy partitioning. Terrestrial water storage increased by up to 300 mm in warm climates and decreased in cold climates. Nitrogen control of photosynthesis is revealed as another missing process in the model. These improvements increase the correlation coefficient of hourly and monthly latent heat fluxes from a range of 0.5–0.6 to the range of 0.7–0.9. RMSE of the simulated sensible heat fluxes decrease by 20–50%. Primary production is overestimated during the wet season in mediterranean and tropical ecosystems. This might be related to missing carbon‐nitrogen dynamics as well as to site‐specific parameters. The new model (CLM3.5) with an improved terrestrial water cycle should lead to more realistic land‐atmosphere exchanges in coupled simulations. FLUXNET is found to be a valuable tool to develop and validate land surface models prior to their application in computationally expensive global simulations.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2007JG000562",""

A crucial feature of the taxane family of microtubule stabilizers is their susceptibility to cellular resistance mechanisms including overexpression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), multidrug resistance protein 7 (MRP7), and the βIII isotype of tubulin. The ability of four taccalonolides, A, E, B, and N, to circumvent these multidrug resistance mechanisms was studied. Taccalonolides A, E, B, and N were effective in vitro against cell lines that overexpress Pgp and MRP7. In addition, taccalonolides A and E were highly active in vivo against a doxorubicin- and paclitaxel-resistant Pgp-expressing tumor, Mam17/ADR. An isogenic HeLa-derived cell line that expresses the βIII isotype of tubulin was generated to evaluate the effect of βIII-tubulin on drug sensitivity. When compared with parental HeLa cells, the βIII-tubulin–overexpressing cell line was less sensitive to paclitaxel, docetaxel, epothilone B, and vinblastine. In striking contrast, the βIII-tubulin–overexpressing cell line showed greater sensitivity to all four taccalonolides. These data cumulatively suggest that the taccalonolides have advantages over the taxanes in their ability to circumvent multiple drug resistance mechanisms. The ability of the taccalonolides to overcome clinically relevant mechanisms of drug resistance in vitro and in vivo confirms that the taccalonolides represent a valuable addition to the family of microtubule-stabilizing compounds with clinical potential.

In this work, we model the sedimentary architecture of the alluvium deposits in Fortymile Wash, Nevada, using a hierarchical transition probability geostatistical approach. The alluvial aquifer comprises a segment of the groundwater flow pathway from the potential high‐level nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada to the downstream accessible environment and may be a natural barrier to radionuclide migration. Thus our main goal is to quantify the impact of spatial variability in the alluvium on solute transport. The alluvial aquifer is a gravel‐dominated braid‐belt deposit, having lower‐permeability paleosols interstratified with higher‐permeability gravel‐bar deposits. A three‐dimensional hierarchical hydrofacies model is developed through fusion of multiple geologic data types and sources. Markov chain models of transition probabilities are employed to represent complex patterns of spatial variability at each hierarchical level in a geostatistical fashion and to impose realistic constraints to such variations through conditioning on existing data. The link between the alluvium spatial variability and solute dispersion at different spatiotemporal scales is demonstrated using the stochastic‐Lagrangian transport theory. We show that the longitudinal macrodispersivity can be on the order of hundreds to thousands of meters, and it may not reach its asymptotic value until after 1,000 years of traveltime.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2007WR006119",""

Despite recent efforts to change the clinical education model, implementation of proposed faculty recruitment and compensation programs, and creation of education‐ corporate partnerships, the authors argue that the current economics of public dental education is not sustainable. To remain viable, the dental education system must adopt transformational actions to re‐engineer the program for long‐term stability. The proposed re‐engineering includes strategies in the following three areas: 1) educational process redesign, 2) reduction and redistribution of time in dental school, and 3) development of a regional curriculum. The intent of these strategies is to address the financial challenges, while educating adequate numbers of dentists at a reasonable cost to both the student and the institution in addition to maintaining dental education within research universities as a learned profession.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fj.0022-0337.2008.72.12.tb04622.x",""

The objective is to isolate the true causal effects of neighborhood attributes on household bicycle ownership from a spurious association because of residential self-selection effects. The joint model accounts for residential self-selection because of both observed sociodemographic characteristics and unobserved preferences. In addition, the model allows differential residential self-selection effects across different sociodemographic segments. The model was estimated by using a sample of more than 5,000 households from the San Francisco, California, Bay Area. Furthermore, a policy simulation analysis was carried out to estimate the impacts of neighborhood characteristics and sociodemographics on bicycle ownership. The model results show a substantial presence of residential self-selection effects because of observed sociodemographics, such as the number of children, dwelling type, and house ownership. It is shown for the first time in the self-selection literature that ignoring such observed self-selection effects may not always lead to overestimation of the impact of neighborhood attributes on travel-related choices, such as bicycle ownership. In the current context, ignoring self-selection because of sociodemographic attributes resulted in an underestimation of the impact of neighborhood attributes on bicycle ownership. In the context of unobserved factors, no significant self-selection effects were found. However, it is recommended that such effects as well as the heterogeneity in such effects be tested for before it is concluded that there are no unobserved factors contributing to residential self-selection.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/2082-03",""

By using the linear stability theory, the critical Rayleigh number, wave number, and frequency for stationary and oscillatory convections were determined. The effects of the viscoelastic parameters and the porous parameter on the critical Rayleigh number for oscillatory convection were analyzed. Based on the results of the linear stability analysis, a nonlinear stability analysis was also conducted. It is shown that the onset of stationary convection has the form of a supercritical and stable bifurcation independent of the viscoelastic parameters. However, the onset of oscillatory convection has the forms of supercritical or subcritical bifurcations. The nature of the oscillatory mode depends strongly on the viscoelastic parameters. The variation of the Nusselt number with respect to the Rayleigh number is derived for stationary and oscillatory convection modes. Although the critical Rayleigh number for stationary convection is independent of the viscoelastic parameters, the Nusselt number depends on the viscoelastic parameters of the fluids, which is different from that for the modified Darcy–Oldroyd model.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.2972154/15878218/084103_1_online.pdf",""

Muscle biopsies were collected from pups, juveniles and adults and analyzed for changes in fiber type, mitochondrial density, myoglobin concentrations, and aerobic, lipolytic and anaerobic enzyme activities. The fiber type results showed a decrease in type I fibers with a significant increase in type IIA fibers as the animals mature. In addition, the volume density of mitochondria and the activity of lipolytic enzymes significantly decreased as the seals matured. To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative account describing a decrease in aerobic fibers shifting towards an increase in fast‐twitch oxidative fibers with a significant decrease in mitochondrial density as the animals mature. These differences in muscle physiology are due to their three stages of life history. During the first few weeks of life, pups are a non‐diving terrestrial mammal that must rely on natal fur for thermoregulation in the harsh conditions of Antarctica. The increased aerobic capacity of pups, associated with increased mitochondrial volumes, acts to provide additional thermogenesis. As these future elite divers mature, their skeletal muscles transform to a more sedentary state in order to maintain the low levels of aerobic metabolism associated with long duration diving.","",""

In addition, the alloys exhibit a sequence of intermediate martensites with the modulated structures usually appearing at c/a < 1 while the low-temperature non- modulated tetragonal structures have c/a > 1. Typically, in the Ni-based alloys, the martensitic transformation is accompanied by a systematic change of the electronic structure in the vicinity of the Fermi energy, where a peak in the electronic density of states from the non-bonding Ni states is shifted from the occupied region to the unoccupied energy range, which is associated with a reconstruction of the Fermi surface, and, in most cases, by pronounced phonon anomalies. The latter appear in high-temperature cubic austenite, premartensite but also in the modulated phases. In addition, the modulated phases have highly mobile twin boundaries which can be rearranged by an external magnetic field due to the high magnetic anisotropy, which builds up in the martensitic phases and which is the origin of the magnetic shape memory effect. This overall scenario is confirmed by first-principles calculations.","https://www.scientific.net/MSF.583.21.pdf",""

These compounds are of interest because of their potency as phosphatase inhibitors as well as their insulin enhancing properties and potential for the treatment of diabetes. Experimental solid-state NMR results show that the electric field gradient tensors in the V(V)O2-dipicolinate derivatives are affected significantly by substitution on the dipicolinate ring and range from 5.8to8.3MHz. The chemical shift anisotropies show less dramatic variations with respect to the ligand changes and range between −550 and −600ppm. To gain insights on the origins of the NMR parameters, DFT calculations were conducted for an extensive series of the V(V)O2- and V(V)O-dipicolinate complexes. To assess the level of theory required for the accurate calculation of the V51 NMR parameters, different functionals, basis sets, and structural models were explored in the DFT study. It is shown that the original x-ray crystallographic geometries, including all counterions and solvation water molecules within 5Å of the vanadium, lead to the most accurate results. The choice of the functional and the basis set at a high level of theory has a relatively minor impact on the outcome of the chemical shift anisotropy calculations; however, the use of large basis sets is necessary for accurate calculations of the quadrupole coupling constants for several compounds of the V(V)O2 series. These studies demonstrate that even though the vanadium compounds under investigations exhibit distorted trigonal bipyramidal coordination geometry, they have a “perfect” trigonal bipyramidal electronic environment. This observation could potentially explain why vanadate and vanadium(V) adducts are often recognized as potent transition state analogs.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.2830239/15409494/052317_1_online.pdf",""

In particular, previous models typically consider only three or four of five key revenue management features that we have purposely built into our model: (1) pricing, (2) resource allocation, (3) dynamic competition, (4) an explicit network, and (5) uncertain demand. Illustrative realizations of the abstract problem we study are those of airline revenue management and service provision by companies facing resource constraints. Under fairly general regularity conditions, we prove existence and uniqueness of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium for dynamic oligopolistic service network competition described by our model. We also show, for an appropriate notion of regularity, that competition leads to the underpricing of network services, a finding numerically illustrated by an example of intermediate size.

Each method has benefits and drawbacks, making the ‘best’ choice dependent on the purpose of the analysis. Owing to its construction, the Fourier method includes all the flow fields that are translational invariants of the simulated flow fields. Thus, the Fourier method converges to an estimate of the dimension of the chaotic attractor in less total simulation time than the method of snapshots. The converse is that for a given simulation, the method of snapshots yields a basis set that is more optimal because it does not include all of the translational invariants that were not a part of the simulation. Using the Fourier method yields smooth structures with definable subclasses based upon Fourier wavenumber pairs, and results in a new dynamical systems insight into turbulent pipe flow. These subclasses include a set of modes that propagate with a nearly constant phase speed, act together as a wave packet and transfer energy from streamwise rolls. It is these interactions that are responsible for bursting events and Reynolds stress generation. These structures and dynamics are similar to those found in turbulent channel flow.

The purpose of this study was to document age- and sex-associated variation in household activities and daily steps walking to school of youth 9–17 years in an indigenous subsistence agricultural community in Oaxaca, southern Mexico. Activities during leisure were also considered. A cross-sectional survey of a rural Zapotec-speaking community was undertaken, and respondents included 118 boys and 152 girls, aged 8.7–17.9 years. Household and leisure activities were documented by questionnaire and subsequent interview. Household activities were classified by estimated intensity for before and after school and on the weekend, and an estimate of METS per day accumulated while doing chores was derived. Number of steps from home to school was estimated. Contingency table analysis and MANCOVA controlling for age was used to evaluate results. Household activities tended to cluster at light and moderate intensities in girls and at moderate to moderate-to-vigorous intensities in boys. Estimated METS per day in ~2 h of chores differed significantly by sex. Secondary school girls expended significantly more METS per day in chores than primary school girls, but there was no difference by school level in boys. The daily round trip from home to school was ~2400 steps for primary students and ~2700 and ~3100 steps for secondary boys and girls, respectively. Television viewing and participation in sports were major leisure activities for boys and girls. Daily household chores, walking, and leisure activities suggest moderately active and moderately-to-vigorously active lifestyles in girls and boys, respectively, in this indigenous subsistence agricultural community.","http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/full-xml/10.1139/H08-043",""

Atazanavir (ATV), a potent once-daily PI, has been recognized for its convenience to patients, and some studies describe improved lipid metabolism. However, its effects on insulin sensitivity have not been elucidated. We conducted this study to test the hypothesis that ATV improves insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. Methods: We prospectively studied 9 HIV-infected men with dyslipidemia (median age, 53 years; baseline triglyceride level, >200 mg/dL) on stable PI-containing antiretroviral therapy who elected to change PI therapy to ritonavir-boosted ATV therapy, dose of 300/100 mg. We measured insulin resistance at baseline and after 12 weeks of therapy using a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp (insulin dose, 200 mU/m Results: All 9 patients completed the study and maintained undetectable viral loads (<50 copies/mL) and stable CD4 counts. After 12 weeks, insulin sensitivity significantly improved (+28%; P = 0.008) in all patients. Triglyceride levels also improved. Conclusions: Using the gold-standard euglycemic clamp, ritonavir-boosted ATV therapy improved PI-induced insulin resistance among dyslipidemic HIV-infected men on PI-based antiretroviral therapy. These findings were not attributable to a change in body weight and provide further evidence for ATV's unique metabolic profile among the PIs.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2310/JIM.0b013e3181641b26",""

A credibility model, allowing Jewish public opinion to influence U.S., Palestinian, and Israeli behavior within a given month, fits best. More pacific Israeli opinion leads to more immediate Palestinian hostility toward Israelis. This response's direction suggests a negative feedback mechanism in which low-level conflict is maintained and momentum toward either all-out war or dramatic peace is slowed.

A key prerequisite to find effective alternatives to meeting an ozone air quality standard is to understand the importance of local anthropogenic emissions, the significance of biogenic emissions, and the contribution of long-range transport. In this study, an air quality modeling system that includes chemistry and transport, CMAQ, an emission processing model, SMOKE, and a mesoscale numerical meteorological model, WRF, has been applied to investigate an ozone event occurring during the period of the 1996 Paso del Norte Ozone Campaign. The results show that the modeling system exhibits the capability to simulate this high ozone occurrence by providing a comparable temporal variation of surface ozone concentration at one station and to capture the spatial evolution of the event. Several sensitivity tests were also conducted to identify the contributions to high surface ozone concentration from eight VOC subspecies, biogenic VOCs, anthropogenic VOCs and long-range transportation of ozone and its precursors. It is found that the reductions of ETH, ISOP, PAR, OLE and FORM help to mitigate the surface ozone concentration, and like anthropogenic VOCs, biogenic VOC plays a nonnegligible role in ozone formation. But for this case, long-range transport of ozone and its precursors appears to produce an insignificant contribution.","https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/5/4/181/pdf",""

Methods: Adult male C57BL/6 mice were divided into 3 groups: 1) the saline group (TBI and saline [13 mice]); 2) EPO group (TBI and rhEPO [12]); and 3) sham group (sham and rhEPO [8]). Traumatic brain injury was induced by controlled cortical impact. Bromodeoxyuridine (100 mg/kg) was injected daily for 10 days, starting 1 day after injury, for labeling proliferating cells. Recombinant human erythropoietin was administered intraperitoneally at 6 hours and at 3 and 7 days post-TBI (5000 U/kg body weight, total dosage 15,000 U/kg). Neurological function was assessed using the Morris water maze and footfault tests. Animals were killed 35 days after injury, and brain sections were stained for immunohistochemical evaluation. Results: Traumatic brain injury caused tissue loss in the cortex and cell loss in the dentate gyrus (DG) as well as impairment of sensorimotor function (footfault testing) and spatial learning (Morris water maze). Traumatic brain injury alone stimulated cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Compared with saline treatment, rhEPO significantly reduced lesion volume in the cortex and cell loss in the DG after TBI and substantially improved recovery of sensorimotor function and spatial learning performance. It enhanced neurogenesis in the injured cortex and the DG. Conclusions: Recombinant human erythropoietin initiated 6 hours post-TBI provided neuroprotection by decreasing lesion volume and cell loss as well as neurorestoration by enhancing neurogenesis, subsequently improving sensorimotor and spatial learning function. It is a promising neuroprotective and neurorestorative agent for TBI and warrants further investigation.","https://thejns.org/downloadpdf/journals/j-neurosurg/109/3/article-p510.xml",""

The impactites comprise impact melt‐rich, suevitic breccia followed by megablocks of Cretaceous limestones, calcarenites, dolomites, and anhydrites. Measurements of porosity, density, and thermal parameters on 450 samples (equidistant sampling, complete depth range) and of ultrasonic velocities and electric resistivity on 80 representative samples are used to investigate the physical properties of carbonate rocks and to study the influence of the impact. Experiments under elevated pressure, calculations using frequency‐dependent Biot‐Gassmann theory, and cross‐checking with borehole logs, where available, show that ultrasonic laboratory and sonic in situ data correspond. Sonic and electric quasi‐continuous logs are obtained from empirical correlations with thermal conductivity, density, and porosity and consideration of mineralogical composition and microstructure. These data give constraints on interpretation and geophysical modeling of, e.g., seismic and gravity data. In the Tertiary postimpact limestone section, the rock fabric (porosity) influences the physical properties. The upper boundary of the impactites is distinctly determined by the high inhomogeneity factor and anisotropy coefficient of thermal conductivity and by the temperature gradient from high‐resolution borehole temperature measurements. All physical properties indicate that the upper part of the suevitic breccia can be distinguished from the lower suevite unit. In the Cretaceous megablocks, a high variability of all properties (particularly, thermal conductivity, density of solid material, and temperature gradient) due to the high variability in the mineral composition (calcite, dolomite, anhydrite) is observed.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2007JB005420",""

The neural processes underlying this behavioural sex difference remain obscure. Differences in behavioural selectivity could result from differences in how sensitive sensory systems are to mating signals, distinct thresholds in motor areas regulating behaviour, or sex differences in selectivity at a gateway relaying sensory information to motor systems. We tested these hypotheses in frogs using the expression of egr-1 to quantify the neural responses of each sex to mating signals. We found that egr-1 expression in a midbrain auditory region was elevated in males in response to both conspecific and heterospecific calls, whereas in females, egr-1 induction occurred only in response to conspecific signals. This differential neural selectivity mirrored the sex differences in behavioural responsiveness to these stimuli. By contrast, egr-1 expression in lower brainstem auditory centres was not different in males and females. Our results support a model in which sex differences in behavioural selectivity arise from sex differences in the neural selectivity in midbrain areas relaying sensory information to the forebrain.","https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsbl.2008.0192",""

Using a conditional transgenic allele,we demonstrate that TTG1 directly targets the same genes as the bHLH protein GLABRA3 (GL3). In vivo binding of the R2R3-MYB protein GLABRA1 (GL1) to the promoters of GLABRA2 (GL2), TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA2 (TTG2), CAPRICE (CPC) and ENHANCER OF TRIPTYCHON AND CAPRICE1 (ETC1) establishes that these genes are major transcriptional targets for the TTG1-bHLH-MYB regulatory complex.

Objective:: To investigate the comparability of 2 HRQL instalments, the Short Form-12 (SF-12) survey and the MacNew Heart Disease HRQL survey (MacNew) in patients with cardiac diseases. Methods:: A nonexperimental cross-sectional study was conducted in a lipid clinic in the Houston metropolitan area. Patients with a prior cardiac disease were requested to complete the SF-12 and the MacNew scales while waiting to see the physician during their regular clinic visit, Cronbach's u values were estimated to evaluate internal consistency. Spearman's correlation was performed to examine the correlation between the SF-12 and the MacNew scale domains, Results:: A total of 118 patients were enrolled in this study. High Cronbach's a (from 0.89 to 0.94) were observed from all component scores in the MacNew scales. Physical component scores from the SF-12 and from the MacNew were highly correlated (r = 0.74; p < 0.001), as were the mental component score from the SF-12 and the emotional component score from the MacNew (r = 0.68; p < 0.001).

This support vector machine model is tested and compared with a multinomial logit model and a multilayer feedforward neural network model based on data collected in the San Francisco Bay Area in California. Two scenarios with different training data sizes are tested. For both scenarios, the support vector machine model outperforms the multinomial logit model in terms of fitting and testing results. Although the multilayer feedforward neural network model performs best for fitting, it underperforms the other two models for testing. It is recommended that the support vector machine model be used as an alternative procedure for travel mode choice modeling because of its promising performance and easy implementation.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/2076-16",""

These nocturnal and mostly arboreal snakes were tracked using implanted radio-transmitters. A vegetation survey of the study site was performed to determine if brown treesnakes non-randomly select certain plants for refuge-sites, and thermal profiles of representative refuge sites were obtained with Hobo data loggers. Brown treesnakes preferentially used Pandanus crowns for refuge-sites. Although Pandanus represents a small proportion (3.6%) of the forest, most snakes used Pandanus most of the time for refuge. The thermal characteristics of Pandanus were comparable to those of other refuge-sites. We speculate that features of Pandanus that provide basking opportunities and moist microhabitats may be important for brown treesnakes. As Pandanus is widely distributed throughout the natural range of the brown treesnake, this genus may represent an important refuge-site for this species.","https://brill.com/view/journals/amre/29/2/article-p284_16.xml",""

However, the immunological consequences of exposing memory T cells to high Ag loads during acute and persistent infection with systemic pathogens are poorly understood. We investigated this by using infection with Anaplasma marginale, a ruminant pathogen that replicates to levels of 109 bacteria per ml of blood during acute infection and maintains mean bacteremia levels of 106 per ml during long-term persistent infection. We established that immunization-induced Ag-specific peripheral blood CD4+ T cell responses were rapidly and permanently lost following infection. To determine whether these T cells were anergic, sequestered in the spleen, or physically deleted from peripheral blood, CD4+ T lymphocytes from the peripheral blood specific for the major surface protein (MSP) 1a T cell epitope were enumerated by DRB3*1101 tetramer staining and FACS analysis throughout the course of immunization and challenge. Immunization induced significant epitope-specific T lymphocyte responses that rapidly declined near peak bacteremia to background levels. Concomitantly, the mean frequency of tetramer+CD4+ cells decreased rapidly from 0.025% before challenge to a preimmunization level of 0.0003% of CD4+ T cells. Low frequencies of tetramer+CD4+ T cells in spleen, liver, and inguinal lymph nodes sampled 9–12 wk postchallenge were consistent with undetectable or unsustainable Ag-specific responses and the lack of T cell sequestration. Thus, infection of cattle with A. marginale leads to the rapid loss of Ag-specific T cells and immunologic memory, which may be a strategy for this pathogen to modulate the immune response and persist.","https://journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article-pdf/181/11/7759/1260133/zim02308007759.pdf",""

Based on experimental characterization, the constitutive properties of the honeycomb cores under flat-wise compression are approximated by an elastic perfectly plastic material with inclusion of hardening after densification. Two different cell size materials are tested and compared, and the effect of strain rate on the crushing stress is studied. The experimental results show that the crushing platen stress is directly related to the relative density of core materials, and it can be associated with the strain rate, even though the effect of strain rates is not so dominant based on the conducted quasi-static tests. A simple physical model for predicting the crushing wave length and stress is proposed and compared with the experimental data and available formulas in the literature. It is observed that the crushing wave length is close to the cell size and related to the geometric dimension and strain rate. The folding mechanism is also measured by the ARAMIS system (a photogrammetry technique), and the measured von Mises strains are compared with the numerical results from LS-DYNA, demonstrating that the folding mechanism is initiated by two plastic hinge lines formed at the cell corners. Multilayer effect is also investigated, and it indicates that including the second layer slightly decreases the maximal crushing stress, but the simple superposition is still applicable for crushing multilayer honeycomb cores with different density. Partial crushing due to small size cylindrical indenter is further studied, and the experiment shows that the partial crushing process can be described by an elastic—plastic hardening material. Side impact process of honeycomb materials is also investigated, and the collapse band and its propagation process are captured. The thorough characterization of core crushing behavior conducted in this study provides better understanding of the failure process of honeycomb materials and can be further employed to study energy absorption and impact response of sandwich structures.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1099636207078647",""

We took advantage of data pooled in the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology Consortium to evaluate the role of involuntary smoking in head and neck carcinogenesis. Involuntary smoking exposure data were pooled across six case-control studies in Central Europe, Latin America, and the United States. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were estimated for 542 cases and 2,197 controls who reported never using tobacco, and the heterogeneity among the study-specific ORs was assessed. In addition, stratified analyses were done by subsite. No effect of ever involuntary smoking exposure either at home or at work was observed for head and neck cancer overall. However, long duration of involuntary smoking exposure at home and at work was associated with an increased risk (OR for &gt;15 years at home, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.12-2.28; Ptrend &lt; 0.01; OR for &gt;15 years at work, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.04-2.30; Ptrend = 0.13). The effect of duration of involuntary smoking exposure at home was stronger for pharyngeal and laryngeal cancers than for other subsites. An association between involuntary smoking exposure and the risk of head and neck cancer, particularly pharyngeal and laryngeal cancers, was observed for long duration of exposure. These results are consistent with those for active smoking and suggest that elimination of involuntary smoking exposure might reduce head and neck cancer risk among never smokers.

A 2 (placebo vs. lipopolysaccharide, LPS) × 2 (no GTPs vs. 0.5% GTPs in drinking water) factorial design using 40 female rats (3‐month‐old) assigned to 4 groups (n=10/group): placebo (P, placebo implantation), LPS implantation (L), P+0.5% GTP (PG), and LPS+0.5% GTP (LG) for 12 wks. After 12 weeks, LPS resulted in a significant increase in inflammation index based on white blood cell count (WBC), accompanied by a significant decrease in bone mineral density (BMD). Supplementation of GTP significantly lowered the WBC and increased BMD. Neither LPS nor GTP affected cortical bone parameters measured by microcomputed tomography at femur midshaft. These results demonstrated that GTPs supplementation mitigates LPS‐induced bone mineral density loss in female rats. Such a protective role of GTPs may be, in part, attributed to decreased inflammation. This study suggests a potentially significant prophylactic role of green tea in bone health of women with chronic inflammation‐induced bone loss.","",""

Two nearby sites inside and outside of the streak were selected for visible and infrared remote sensing and for elemental abundance measurements and images of the microscopic soil morphology. The rover was next sent to study the interaction of the wind streak with an obstacle, a small rock near the source of the streak. Opportunity's observations suggest that the Victoria wind streaks are deposits of basaltic sand blown out of the crater from the dark dunes nestled below the crater rim, particularly at the base of the alcove leading up to the darkest streak. No local sources of sand have been identified within the Victoria crater wall rock, suggesting that the sand is supplied from outside the crater and is presently escaping its temporary topographic trap. This process presents a possible explanation for the serrated margin of Victoria crater through abrasion of the soft rock as trapped sands are blown out of the crater and carve alcoves under various seasonal winds. Some indication of the rate of activity of these wind streaks will be provided by continued monitoring of the erasure of the rover's tracks.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2008JE003102",""

Research suggests that daughters often take on these stressful caregiving responsibilities, with varying levels of help from siblings. In this article, we examine these sibling relationships within the caregiving context, considering the ways in which siblings negotiate the division of tasks for elderly parents and make sense of siblings who provide little help in caregiving activities. Our content analysis of interviews with 25 family caregivers indicated that there was little negotiation of caregiving tasks. Furthermore, family caregivers make sense of sibling participation in caregiving in three ways. First, some caregivers account for caregiving as an individual activity for which they are especially suited. Second, some caregivers see caregiving as stemming from values about family life, but excuse nonparticipant siblings by defining them as outside family boundaries. Finally, caregivers with strong family values who could not make sense of siblings through an exclusionary frame engaged in verbal backtracking during the telling of their stories as a way of making sense of personal caregiving responsibilities.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1049732308327195",""

The phosphorus percentage affects the film microstructure, and incorporating &gt;13% P resulted in amorphous Ru(P) films. While codosing P(CH3)3 with Ru3(CO)12 improves film step coverage, the most conformal Ru(P) film is obtained with cis-RuH2(P(CH3)3)4. A fully continuous 5 nm Ru(P) film is formed within 1 μm deep, 8:1 aspect ratio trenches. The barrier performance is tested using Cu/Ru/Si(100) stacks annealed at 575 K, and sheet resistance was used as a measure of barrier failure. Cu diffusivity in physical vapor deposition (PVD) Ru is approximated to be 6.6×10−17 cm2/s at 575 K, which indicates fast Cu diffusion along the grain boundaries. While 26 nm polycrystalline PVD Ru failed after 6 h annealing by Cu penetration, 28 nm amorphous Ru(P) survived after 67 h annealing. First principles density functional calculations suggest 16.7% P degraded the adhesion strength by 12% when compared to crystalline Cu/Ru, by the presence of P at the interface. However, due to the strong Ru-Cu bonds, amorphous Ru(P) still forms a stronger interface with Cu than do Ta and TaN to Cu, as observed when annealing 10 nm Cu films on these surfaces at 675 K.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jva/article-pdf/26/4/974/15605840/974_1_online.pdf",""

Reperfusion exacerbates the oxidative stress that occurs after such injuries and may impair recovery. Resuscitation after hypoxic-ischemic injury is routinely performed using 100% oxygen, and this practice may increase the oxidative stress that occurs during reperfusion and further damage an already compromised brain. We show that brief exposure (30 mins) to 100% oxygen during reperfusion worsens the histologic injury in young mice after unilateral brain hypoxia—ischemia, causes an accumulation of the oxidative metabolite nitrotyrosine, and depletes preoligodendrocyte glial progenitors present in the cortex. This damage can be reversed with administration of the antioxidant ebselen, a glutathione peroxidase mimetic. Moreover, mice recovered in 100% oxygen have a more disrupted pattern of myelination and develop a static motor deficit that mimics cerebral palsy and manifests itself by significantly worse performance on wire hang and rotorod motor testing. We conclude that exposure to 100% oxygen during reperfusion after hypoxic-ischemic brain injury increases secondary neural injury, depletes developing glial progenitors, interferes with myelination, and ultimately impairs functional recovery.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1038/jcbfm.2008.15",""

As the CL excitation is moved away from the apex a systematic redshift is observed. The redshift is ∼4 nm for pyramids with 3 μm base dimension and ∼2 nm for the 500 nm pyramids.

Imprinting provides a way to precisely control the interdigitized heterojunction morphology, leading to improved solar cell performance.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-pdf/26/6/2562/15953016/2562_1_online.pdf",""

Depth-imaging artifacts are poorly constrained velocity results that cause defocusing and/or incorrect structures in the migrated stack. The quality of an inverted velocity distribution from a tomographic approach depends heavily on ray coverage. In areas of poor ray coverage with a small ray count or parallel rays, the velocity distribution can be nonunique because of the lack of constraints. In the case of large residual moveouts from prestack migration, which most likely could happen in the presence of a complex geologic setting, serious depth-imaging artifacts can appear in the velocity field inverted using SST. To solve this problem, we tested the ability of MST to constrain artifacts in a case study. MST parameterizes the study area into overlapping submodels of different grid sizes. The inverted velocity-perturbation value for a specific location is the superposition of velocity-perturbation values from those submodels. The submodel with a large grid size provides a stable regional value that helps constrain local artifacts from submodels of smaller grid sizes. Artifacts using SST are suppressed significantly by MST. Migrated stack and common-image gathers indicated improvements in the velocity field from MST compared with the initial velocity field and that from SST.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/1.2953088",""

The authors investigate the influence of these factors on potential future changes in summertime daily 8-h maximum ozone over the United States and China by comparing Model for Ozone and Related Chemical Tracers, version 2.4, (MOZART-2.4) simulations for the period 1996–2000 with 2095–99, using climate projections from NCAR–Department of Energy Parallel Climate Model simulations driven by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios A1fi (higher) and B1 (lower) emission scenarios, with corresponding changes in biogenic emissions. The effect of projected climate changes alone on surface ozone is generally less than 3 ppb over most regions. Regional ozone increases and decreases are driven mainly by local warming and marine air dilution enhancement, respectively. Changes are approximately the same magnitude under both scenarios, although spatial patterns of responses differ. Projected increases in isoprene emissions (32%–94% over both countries), however, result in significantly greater changes in surface ozone. Increases of 1–15 ppb are found under A1fi and of 0–7 ppb are found under B1. These increases not only raise the frequency of “high ozone days,” but are also projected to occur nearly uniformly across the distribution of daily ozone maxima. Thus, projected future ozone changes appear to be more sensitive to changes in biogenic emissions than to direct climate changes, and the spatial patterns and magnitude of future ozone changes depend strongly on the future emissions scenarios used.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jamc/article-pdf/47/7/1888/3543370/2007jamc1681_1.pdf",""

We hypothesize that the majority of inherited factors are moderately penetrant genes, common in the population. We use an affected sibling pair approach to identify genetic regions that are coinherited by siblings with colorectal cancer. Individuals from families with at least two siblings diagnosed with colorectal adenocarcinoma or high-grade dysplasia were enrolled. Known familial colorectal cancer syndromes were excluded. A genome-wide scan on 151 DNA samples from 70 kindreds was completed using deCODE 1100 short tandem repeat marker set at an average 4-cM density. Fine mapping on a total of 184 DNAs from 83 kindreds was done in regions suggesting linkage. Linkage analysis was accomplished with Merlin analysis package. Nonparametric linkage analysis revealed three genetic regions with logarithm of the odds (LOD) scores ≥2.0: Ch. 3q29, LOD 2.61 (P = 0.0003); Ch. 4q31.3, LOD 2.13 (P = 0.0009); and Ch. 7q31.31, LOD 3.08 (P = 0.00008). Affected siblings with increased sharing at the 7q31 locus have a 3.8-year (± 3.5) earlier age of colorectal cancer onset although this is not statistically significant (P = 0.11). No significant linkage was found near genes causing known syndromes or regions previously reported (8q24, 9q22, and 11q23). The chromosome 3q21–q24 region reported to be linked in colorectal cancer relative pairs is supported by our study, albeit a minor peak (LOD 0.9; P = 0.02).

New targets and strategies for offsetting the effect of obesity on cancer risk are urgently needed. In the present study, we examined the effect of dietary energy balance manipulation on steady-state signaling in multiple epithelial tissues, with a focus on the Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways. For these experiments, male FVB/N and C57BL/6 and female ICR mice were maintained on a control (10 kcal% fat) diet, a diet-induced obesity (DIO; 60 kcal% fat) regimen, or a 30% calorie restriction (CR) regimen for 15 to 17 weeks. Relative to the control group, the DIO regimen increased, whereas CR decreased, circulating insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) as has previously been reported. Western blot analyses showed that the DIO regimen enhanced, whereas CR inhibited, activation of Akt and mTOR, regardless of epithelial tissue or genetic background. In contrast, activation of AMP-activated protein kinase was modulated by dietary energy balance manipulation in the liver but not in the epidermis or dorsolateral prostate. Western blot analyses of epidermal extracts taken from ICR mice also revealed reduced activation of both the IGF-I receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor in CR mice, compared with control mice or mice maintained on the DIO regimen. Taken together, these novel findings suggest that dietary energy balance modulates signaling through cell-surface receptors (i.e., IGF-I receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor), affecting activation of multiple downstream pathways including Akt and mTOR, thus providing important dietary and pharmacologic targets for disrupting the obesity-cancer link.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerpreventionresearch/article-pdf/1/1/65/2241945/65.pdf",""

In this study, Sohlh2 and several other germ cell transcripts were found to be induced in mouse embryonic stem cells when cultured on a feeder cell line that overexpresses bone morphogenetic protein 4. To study the function of Sohlh2 in germ cells, we generated mice harboring null alleles of Sohlh2. Male Sohlh2-deficient mice were infertile because of a block in spermatogenesis. Although normal prior to birth, Sohlh2-null mice had reduced numbers of intermediate and type B spermatogonia by postnatal day 7. By day 10, development to the preleptotene spermatocyte stage was severely disrupted, rendering seminiferous tubules with only Sertoli cells, undifferentiated spermatogonia, and degenerating colonies of differentiating spermatogonia. Degenerating cells resembled type A2 spermatogonia and accumulated in M-phase prior to death. A similar phenotype was observed in Sohlh2-null mice on postnatal days 14, 21, 35, 49, 68, and 151. In adult Sohlh2-mutant mice, the ratio of undifferentiated type A spermatogonia (DAZL+/PLZF+) to differentiating type A spermatogonia (DAZL+/PLZF−) was twice normal levels. In culture, undifferentiated type A spermatogonia isolated from Sohlh2-null mice proliferated normally but linked the mutant phenotype to aberrant cell surface expression of the receptor-tyrosine kinase cKit. Thus, Sohlh2 is required for progression of differentiating type A spermatogonia into type B spermatogonia. One conclusion originating from these studies would be that testicular factors normally regulate the viability of differentiating spermatogonia by signaling through Sohlh2. This regulation would provide a crucial checkpoint to optimize the numbers of spermatocytes entering meiosis during each cycle of spermatogenesis.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1634/stemcells.2007-0502",""

We therefore developed and implemented the “research-intensive community” model with the aim of aligning diverse goals of participants while simultaneously optimizing research productivity. The fundamental organizational unit is a team consisting of one graduate student and three undergraduates from different majors, supervised by a faculty member. Undergraduate workshops, Graduate Leadership Forums, and computer-mediated communication provide an infrastructure to optimize programmatic efficiency and sustain a multilevel, interdisciplinary community of scholars dedicated to research.

However, water imbibition induced by emulsification at low interfacial tension is not well understood. Recently, anionic surfactants have been shown to induce imbibition in mixed wet and oil wet carbonates. Sodium carbonate has been used to reduce the surfactant adsorption. However, calcium and other divalent cations can cause precipitation of the alkali unless soft water is used. This is a significant limitation of sodium carbonate. The present research both advances our understanding of the use of chemicals to enhance oil recovery from fractured carbonate reservoirs and indicates how the process can be optimized using novel chemicals. This research applies to the improvement of oil recovery from mixed wet and oil wet fractured carbonate reservoirs.","https://onepetro.org/SPEIOR/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/113453-MS/2748675/spe-113453-ms.pdf",""

Brain activation associated with performance on a new task, the Emotional Congruence Task, requires judging affective congruence of facial expression and voice, compared with their sex congruence. Participants in this pilot study were adolescents with normal IQ ( n = 5) and autism or without ( n = 4) autism. In the emotional congruence condition, as compared to the sex congruence of voice and face, controls had significantly more activation than the Autism group in the orbitofrontal cortex, the superior temporal, parahippocampal, and posterior cingulate gyri and occipital regions. Unlike controls, the Autism group did not have significantly greater prefrontal activation during the emotional congruence condition, but did during the sex congruence condition. Results indicate the Emotional Congruence Task can be used successfully to assess brain activation and behavior associated with integration of auditory and visual information for emotion. While the numbers in the groups are small, the results suggest that brain activity while performing the Emotional Congruence Task differed between adolescents with and without autism in fronto-limbic areas and in the superior temporal region.

This method is based on modeling rectangular cantilever beam bending as a function of changing temperature. The temperature change is accomplished by heating water as it flows around the cantilever beams in an enclosed compartment. The optical static method of detection is used to measure the deflection of cantilever at the free end. Experimentally determined results are compared to Sader’s method and to the Thermotune method most commonly used in cantilever calibrations. Results indicate that the new bimaterial thermal expansion method is accurate within 15%–20% of the actual cantilever spring constant, which is comparable to other nondestructive calibration techniques.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/rsi/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.2969031/14846694/083706_1_online.pdf",""

Background: Although human factors has always been concerned with helping the operator in his or her work environment, research exploded in the mid-1990s on one relevant construct, situation awareness. Method: We discuss how a distinction present years ago, the product of comprehension versus the process of comprehension, not only continues today but characterizes different research directions. Research on situation awareness has benefited and can continue to benefit from an analogy to the better understood comprehension of narrative and expository text, although such an analogy between text and dynamic environments will ultimately have limits. Results: Situation awareness as a notion that organizes and focuses research efforts has rightfully spread to research in virtually every industrial domain, and it is an essential part of work on automation and design. Conclusion: Work on situation awareness has had a ubiquitous influence on cognitive engineering and has even pushed the envelope of basic cognitive psychology into dynamic domains. Application: Considering situation awareness is also important in cognitive ergonomic issues relevant to training, teamwork, and the design of new human-technical systems.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1518/001872008X288448",""

Compared with open surgery, MIS causes surgeons to engage in more frequent visual scanning to view multiple displays and other locations within the operating room. Visual scanning hastens fatigue, delays response time, and increases cognitive workload. We hypothesized that integrated displays– which present multiple images on a single monitor, would result in less fatigue, lower workload and better perceptual-motor performance than separated displays– which present images on physically separate monitors. Observers performed a pick-and-place task while monitoring “vital signs.” We compared performance between integrated and separated display conditions. Unexpectedly, results indicated that task completion time, fatigue and workload did not differ between display conditions. However, integrated displays did not degrade performance compared with separated displays. The implication is that integrated displays (i.e., fewer monitors) can be used in operating rooms.

Female Swiss-Webster mice were randomized to receive normal water or 5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) drinking water to induce colitis. Mice were treated with either a novel combination of herbal aqueous extracts or vehicle control per os (po) or per rectum (pr) every 24 hours for 7–8 days.

This study, derived from SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute) data, compared the survival experiences of the gemcitabine (1998–2004) and pre-gemcitabine (1988–1997) eras for 7,151 patients who had metastatic disease and did not undergo extirpative surgery, 14,369 patients who had not undergone surgery and had metastases, 5,042 patients who had undergone surgery and did not have metastases, and 5,011 patients who had undergone surgery and had metastases. Calculated survival time ratios (TR) were adjusted for radiotherapy history, grade, nodal status, loco-regional extent of disease, age, race, and gender. For those who did not undergo extirpative surgery, improvements in survival in the gemcitabine era (1998–2004) versus the prior time period (1988–1997) seen for patients with metastatic cancer (TR = 1.20, 95% c.i. 1.15–1.25) were not seen for those without metastatic cancer (TR = 1.05, 95% c.i. 1.00–1.15). For those who did undergo extirpative surgery, improvements were much more dramatic for those with metastatic cancer (TR = 1.61, 95% c.i. 1.45–1.80) than those without metastases (TR = 1.23, 95% c.i. 1.15–1.31).

Consequently, it is of paramount importance that these workloads are representative of real-world applications. However, composing such representative workloads poses practical challenges to application analysis teams and benchmark developers (1) real-world workloads are intellectual property and vendors hesitate to share these proprietary applications; and (2) porting and reducing these applications to benchmarks that can be simulated in a tractable amount of time is a nontrivial task. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a technique that automatically distills key inherent behavioral attributes of a proprietary workload and captures them into a miniature synthetic benchmark clone. The advantage of the benchmark clone is that it hides the functional meaning of the code but exhibits similar performance characteristics as the target application. Moreover, the dynamic instruction count of the synthetic benchmark clone is substantially shorter than the proprietary application, greatly reducing overall simulation time for SPEC CPU, the simulation time reduction is over five orders of magnitude compared to entire benchmark execution. Using a set of benchmarks representative of general-purpose, scientific, and embedded applications, we demonstrate that the power and performance characteristics of the synthetic benchmark clone correlate well with those of the original application across a wide range of microarchitecture configurations.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1400112.1400115",""

Logarithmic growth of P. aeruginosa was demonstrated locally (at the burn site) and systemically (in circulation) in thermally injured mice exposed to 102 CFU/mouse of the pathogen beneath the burn wound. However, neither systemic nor local growth of the pathogen was observed in sham burn mice when they were infected intradermally with 106 CFU/mouse P. aeruginosa. Murine β-defensins (MBDs) were detected in the skin homogenates of sham burn mice. However, the amounts of MBDs were reduced greatly in the same tissue homogenates from thermally injured mice. Gr-1+CD11b+ cells, with an ability to suppress antimicrobial peptide production by skin keratinocytes, were isolated from tissues surrounding the burn areas, and these cells were not obtained from skin tissues of sham burn mice.

To date only a few factors are known to function in SSCs to provide this regulation. Octamer-4 (OCT4) plays a critical role in pluripotency and cell survival of embryonic stem cells and primordial germ cells; however, it is not known whether it plays a similar function in SSCs. Here, we show that OCT4 is required for SSC maintenance in culture and for colonization activity following cell transplantation, using lentiviral-mediated short hairpin RNA expression to knock down OCT4 in an in vitro model for SSCs (“germline stem” [GS] cells). Expression of promyelocytic leukemia zinc-finger (PLZF), a factor known to be required for SSC self-renewal, was not affected by OCT4 knockdown, suggesting that OCT4 does not function upstream of PLZF. In addition to developing a method to test specific gene function in GS cells, we demonstrate that retinoic acid (RA) triggers GS cells to shift to a differentiated, premeiotic state lacking OCT4 and PLZF expression and colonization activity. Our data support a model in which OCT4 and PLZF maintain SSCs in an undifferentiated state and RA triggers spermatogonial differentiation through the direct or indirect downregulation of OCT4 and PLZF. The current study has important implications for the future use of GS cells as an in vitro model for spermatogonial stem cell biology or as a source of embryonic stem-like cells.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1634/stemcells.2008-0134",""

High carbon number internal olefin sulfonates when used with appropriate co-surfactants, co-solvents and alkali show the type of phase behavior and ultra-low interfacial tension needed for almost 100% oil recovery in cores. This work shows how the performance of both surfactant-polymer and alkaline-surfactant-polymer flooding can be dramatically improved at the same or lower cost than with conventional surfactants and applied over a wider range of reservoir conditions. High carbon number internal olefin sulfonate surfactants gave good performance at low concentrations and were found to be compatible with both polymers and alkali such as sodium carbonate when used with appropriate co-solvents. The extremely efficient and effective approach for finding high performance surfactants that we previously presented for light crude oils has now been successfully extended to heavier crude oils. The identification of high-performance surfactants suitable for high-temperature and/or paraffinic oil applications opens up the potential to recover a vast amount of additional oil outside the range of conditions considered practical in the past.","https://onepetro.org/SPEIOR/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/113432-MS/2748258/spe-113432-ms.pdf",""

However, at doses slightly higher than those at which it is protective, GW5074 displays toxicity when tested in neuronal cultures. We report herein the synthesis, biological evaluation, and structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of novel 3-substituted indolin-2-one compounds that are highly neuroprotective but lack the toxicity of GW5074.

The production of the turbulence at the surface near the fire front was caused by increased variance of the ambient wind, while the buoyancy was strongest at higher levels within the fire plume. Immediately after the fire front passage, turbulence kinetic energy decreased to ambient levels and was associated with strong downdrafts that occurred behind the fire front.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2008JD010014",""

During aerobic exercise, prior work using this model has demonstrated similar relative intensities pre- and posttraining, while the absolute workload increases posttraining. However, the prediction equation associated with these changes has not been examined during resistance training. 22 men and 27 women (M age 64 yr.) participated in a 12-wk. resistance training. Orientation determined resistances associated with RPEs of 4, 5–6, 7–8, and 9 on the OMNI-Resistance Exercise Scale for each of seven exercises for each participant. Individuals trained 3 days a week for 12 wk. Linear regression was used to calculate percent of 1-repetition maximum (%1-RM) at RPE 4, 6, and 8 for the exercises. Paired sample t tests, comparing pre- and posttraining %1-RMs at each RPE, indicated that posttraining %1-RMs were higher for RPE 4 and 6 for each exercise, while at RPE 8, results were significant for only 3 exercises. Thus for at least the RPE 4 and 6, the constant RPE tracking model is appropriate for resistance exercise; however, the equation of prediction appears to differ from that for aerobic exercise.

Computation of the stress intensity factor (SIF) at the crack tip provides the basis for crack propagation analysis. Because of the three-dimensional (3-D) nature of a cracked pavement and traffic loading, the best choice for calculating the SIF is 3-D finite element (FE) programs. However, the 3-D FE solutions are often expensive because of a large number for equations and a matrix with comparatively large bandwidth. Sometimes 3-D analyses may overload the available computer capability when the pavement structure is complex. To address these problems, a new FE analysis tool named SA-CrackPro was developed and is discussed in this paper. SA-CrackPro is essentially a two-dimensional SIF calculation program that incorporates a semian-alytical (SA) method. SA-CrackPro can provide the same satisfactory computations and results as a 3-D FE program at a much faster speed and with much fewer computer resource requirements. To simulate the pavement layer interface and load-transfer conditions at the joints (or cracks), thin-layer elements were introduced. To model crack propagation sufficiently and accurately, FE automeshing and remeshing techniques were proposed and implemented in the program. The accuracy of the program was verified through comparisons with a commercial 3-D FE package, ANSYS.

Cross-section TEM studies revealed that both LCMO and PSTO films are good single crystal quality and have atomic sharp interface with respect to the MgO substrate with -6.4% and -6.2% lattice mismatch, respectively. Electron Diffraction Patterns (EDPs) of plan-view LCMO/MgO and PSTO/MgO interfaces exhibit double diffraction spots. An analytical approach was employed using double diffraction to study the two-dimensional in-plane interfaces of perovskite structure films on the salt-rock type substrate. The lattice mismatch near the interface regions was determined using EDPs of the plan-view interfaces and found to be -8.0% for LCMO/MgO and -7.14% for PSTO. Both latter values are larger than those obtained using cross-section TEM. Studies of the sharpness of double diffraction spots and plan-view high resolution (HR) TEM brought a conclusion that the PSTO film is well commensurate with the MgO substrate over large areas, whereas LCMO film is only locally commensurate with the substrate.

Beal conducted the (i) first demonstration of hybrid vigor by controlled crossing of corn lines, 1878; (ii) initiation of the oldest ongoing U.S. botanical experiment involving the vitality of buried seeds, 1879; and (iii) first turfgrass experiments, including polystand compatibility, 1880. He initiated early, extensive seed purity/viability testing in 1877, and also organized the oldest, continuously operating U.S. botanical garden in 1877. He was an early advocate for forest conservation and reforestation. These works resulted in more than 1200 papers, plus seven extensive texts. Beal was a key proponent of scholarly communications among the few isolated scientists active in applied botany and in agricultural research. His efforts contributed to the formation of several important early national agricultural science organizations. Beal was a key founder and first President of the (i) Society for the Promotion of Agricultural Science (SPAS), 1880; (ii) Association of Botanists in the United States Agricultural Experiment Stations, 1889; (iii) Botanical Club of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, 1888; and (iv) Michigan Academy of Science, 1884.

Previous phylogenetic studies involving 62 isolates have defined seven major lineages (I–VII), further divided into 14 clades. In this study, 28 strains isolated in Texas in 1991 and 2001–2003, and three older, previously unsequenced strains from Jamaica and California were sequenced over the envelope protein gene. The inclusion of these new sequences, and others published since 2001, has allowed better delineation of the previously published SLEV lineages, in particular the clades of lineage II. Phylogenetic analysis of 106 isolates identified 13 clades. All 1991 and 2001–2003 isolates from Nueces, Jefferson and Harris Counties (Texas Gulf Coast) group in clade IIB with other isolates from these counties isolated during the 1980s and 1990s. This lack of evidence for introduction of novel strains into the Texas Gulf Coast over a long period of time is consistent with overwintering of SLEV in this region. Two El Paso isolates, both from 2002, group in clade VA with recent Californian isolates from 1998–2001 and some South American strains with a broad temporal range. Overall, these data are consistent with multiple introductions of SLEV from South America into North America, and provide support for the hypothesis that in most situations, SLEV circulates within a locality, with occasional incursions from other areas. Finally, SLEV has much lower nucleotide (10.1 %) and amino acid variation (2.8 %) than other members of the Japanese encephalitis virus complex (maximum variation 24.6 % nucleotide and 11.8 % amino acid).","https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/jgv/10.1099/vir.0.2008/000190-0?crawler=true",""

Water has been used in first generation immersion lithography at 193nm to reach the 45nm node. To reach the 38 and 32nm nodes, fluids with a higher index than water are needed. Ionic additives have a higher index than water and can be added to water in high concentration to obtain a high index fluid. Generally, addition of a high index additive leads to a higher absorbance. The next generation immersion fluid should have both a high index and low absorbance. Therefore, both the index and absorbance of a series of ionic additives in water were characterized to identify an additive with a high index and low absorbance at 193nm. This study revealed that the anion dictates the optical properties of the additive. Of the anions studied, the methylsulfonate anion has the desired characteristics and was dissolved in water at high concentration using heavy metal cations. A saturated solution of lanthanum methylsulfonate had the highest index and lowest absorbance identified, n193=1.58 and α193=0.3cm−1. These high index methylsulfonate solutions were used to image line and space patterns at various NAs. Images of 32nm half-pitch were generated at 1.5 NA with the lanthanum solution.

In previous work, the corresponding ideal magnetohydrodynamics equations have been solved analytically for a plasma flow in a slowly diverging nozzle. That solution indicates that efficient detachment is feasible if the nozzle is sufficiently long. In order to extend the previous model beyond the idealizations of analytical theory, a Lagrangian code is developed in this work to simulate steady-state kinetic plasma flows and to evaluate nozzle efficiency. The code is benchmarked against the analytical results and then used to examine situations that are not analytically tractable, including plasma behavior in the recent Detachment Demonstration Experiment at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pop/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.2903844/14085768/057103_1_online.pdf",""

Deletion of CCR4 or several components of Ccr4-Not complexes results in abnormally large cells. Since yeast must attain a critical cell size at Start to commit to division, the large size of ccr4Δ cells implies that they may have a size-specific proliferation defect. Overexpression of CLN1, CLN2, CLN3, and SWI4 reduces the size of ccr4Δ cells, suggesting that ccr4Δ cells have a G1-phase cyclin deficiency. In support of this, we find that CLN1 and CLN2 expression and budding are delayed in ccr4Δ cells. Moreover, overexpression of CCR4 advances the timing of CLN1 expression, promotes premature budding, and reduces cell size. Genetic analyses suggest that Ccr4 functions independently of Cln3 and downstream of Bck2. Thus, like cln3Δbck2Δ double deletions, cln3Δccr4Δ cells are also inviable. However, deletion of Whi5, a transcriptional repressor of CLN1 and CLN2, restores viability. We find that Ccr4 negatively regulates the half-life of WHI5 mRNAs, and we conclude that, by modulating the stability of WHI5 mRNAs, Ccr4 influences the size-dependent timing of G1-phase cyclin transcription.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/179/1/345/42191839/genetics0345.pdf",""

It has the ability to cause fatal disease in humans and in horses and other domestic animals. We recently demonstrated that replicating VEEV interferes with cellular transcription and uses this phenomenon as a means of downregulating a cellular antiviral response. VEEV capsid protein was found to play a critical role in this process, and its ∼35-amino-acid-long peptide, fused with green fluorescent protein, functioned as efficiently as did the entire capsid. We detected a significant fraction of VEEV capsid associated with nuclear envelope, which suggested that this protein might regulate nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. In this study, we demonstrate that VEEV capsid and its N-terminal sequence efficiently inhibit multiple receptor-mediated nuclear import pathways but have no effect on the passive diffusion of small proteins. The capsid protein of the Old World alphavirus Sindbis virus and the VEEV capsid, with a previously defined frameshift mutation, were found to have no detectable effect on nuclear import. Importantly, the VEEV capsid did not noticeably interfere with nuclear import in mosquito cells, and this might play a critical role in the ability of the virus to develop a persistent, life-long infection in mosquito vectors. These findings demonstrate a new aspect of VEEV-host cell interactions, and the results of this study are likely applicable to other New World alphaviruses, such as eastern and western equine encephalitis viruses.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.02330-07",""

Background.: The clinical trials on which the treatment of advanced colorectal (CRC) is based enroll few elderly patients. Furthermore, few investigations have determined the use and outcomes of the treatment of advanced CRC in practice. This study evaluated the treatment of advanced CRC in community oncology practices, focusing on age-related differences in treatment and outcome. Methods.: A national, retrospective chart review was conducted to evaluate the management of advanced CRC in 10 community practices across the U.S. All medical records of patients diagnosed with advanced CRC initiating chemotherapy treatment after January 1, 2003 through 2006 were included. The primary aim was to compare the proportion receiving doublet chemotherapy (irinotecan or oxaliplatin with a fluoropyrimidine) as initial therapy in young (age ≤65 years) and elderly (age &gt;65 years) patients. Additional aims included age-based comparisons of the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy, overall chemotherapy use, all-cause mortality, and toxicity-related events. Results.: Overall, 520 patients (56% elderly) received 6,253 cycles of chemotherapy. Of the younger patients, 84% received doublet chemotherapy first-line, compared with 58% of elderly patients (p &lt; .001). The use of each of the medications—irinotecan, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab—was lower in elderly patients (p &lt; .001). Independent predictors of a higher risk for mortality were age &gt;65 (adjusted hazards ratio [HR],1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02–1.39) and performance status score ≥2 (HR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.41–1.91). Conclusion.: Elderly patients are less likely to receive first-line doublet chemotherapy than younger patients. Age and performance status are independent predictors of treatment and overall survival.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1634/theoncologist.2008-0061",""

The analysis is conducted using weather data (precipitation and visibility) and loop detector data (speed, flow, and density) obtained from the Baltimore, Maryland; Minneapolis–Saint Paul, Minnesota; and Seattle, Washington, areas in the United States. The precipitation data included intensities up to 1.6 and 0.33 cm/h for rain and water equivalent of snow intensity, respectively. The paper demonstrates that the traffic stream jam density is not affected by weather conditions. Snow results in larger reductions in traffic stream free-flow speed and capacity when compared with rain. Reductions in roadway capacity are not affected by the precipitation intensity except in the case of snow. Reductions in free-flow speed and speed at capacity increase as the rain and snow intensities increase. Finally, the paper also develops free-flow speed, speed-at-capacity, and capacity weather adjustment factors that are multiplied by the base clear-condition variables to compute inclement weather parameters.

However, whether different subsets of these cells have different roles in this process is unclear. To investigate the roles of BM-derived progenitor cell subpopulations in the formation of tumor vasculature in a Ewing's sarcoma model, we used a functional assay based on endothelial cell and pericyte differentiation in vivo. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting of human cord blood/BM or mouse BM from green fluorescent protein transgenic mice was used to isolate human CD34+/CD38−, CD34+/CD45+, and CD34−/CD45+ cells and mouse Sca1+/Gr1+, Sca1−/Gr1+, VEGFR1+, and VEGFR2+ cells. Each of these progenitor subpopulations was separately injected intravenously into nude mice bearing Ewing's sarcoma tumors. Tumors were resected 1 week later and analyzed using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy for the presence of migrated progenitor cells expressing endothelial, pericyte, or inflammatory cell surface markers. We showed two distinct patterns of stem cell infiltration. Human CD34+/CD45+ and CD34+/CD38− and murine VEGFR2+ and Sca1+/Gr1+ cells migrated to Ewing's tumors, colocalized with the tumor vascular network, and differentiated into cells expressing either endothelial markers (mouse CD31 or human vascular endothelial cadherin) or the pericyte markers desmin and α-smooth muscle actin. By contrast, human CD34−/CD45+ and mouse Sca1−/Gr1+ cells migrated predominantly to sites outside of the tumor vasculature and differentiated into monocytes/macrophages expressing F4/80 or CD14.

This study introduces an entirely new testing approach that uses transient temperature data at multiple locations together with a single-point transient pressure measurement. Because the temperature sensors acquire multipoint temperature simultaneously, this technique requires only one surface flow rate changes, thereby reducing the test duration significantly.","https://onepetro.org/SPEATCE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/116270-MS/2736078/spe-116270-ms.pdf",""

Our approach is based on a combination of fast linearized approximation to the dynamic data and the MCMC algorithm. In the first stage, we use streamline-derived sensitivities to obtain an analytical approximation in a small neighborhood of the previously computed dynamic data. The sensitivities can be conveniently obtained using either a finite-difference or streamline simulator. The approximation of the dynamic data is then used to modify the instrumental proposal distribution during MCMC. In the second stage, those proposals that pass the first stage are assessed by running full flow simulations to assure rigorousness in sampling. The uncertainty analysis is carried out by analyzing multiple models sampled from the posterior distribution in the Bayesian formulation for history matching. We demonstrate that the two-stage approach increases the acceptance rate, and significantly reduces the computational cost compared to conventional MCMC sampling without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, both 2D synthetic and 3D field examples demonstrate the power and utility of the two-stage MCMC method for history matching and uncertainty analysis.","https://onepetro.org/SJ/article-pdf/13/01/77/2556763/spe-102476-pa.pdf",""

In the infected cells, alphaviruses express only four nonstructural proteins, which function in the synthesis of virus-specific RNAs and in modification of the intracellular environment. The results of our study suggest that Sindbis virus (SINV) infection in BHK-21 cells leads to the formation of at least two types of nsP3-containing complexes, one of which was found in association with the plasma membrane and endosome-like vesicles, while the second was coisolated with cell nuclei. The latter complexes could be solubilized only with the cytoskeleton-destabilizing detergent. Besides viral nsPs, in the mammalian cells, both complexes contained G3BP1 and G3BP2 (which were found in different ratios), YBX1, and HSC70. Rasputin, an insect cell-specific homolog of G3BP1, was found in the nsP3-containing complexes isolated from mosquito cells, which was suggestive of a high conservation of the complexes in the cells of both vertebrate and invertebrate origin. The endosome- and plasma membrane-associated complexes contained a high concentration of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), which is indicative of their function in viral-RNA synthesis. The dsRNA synthesis is likely to efficiently proceed on the plasma membrane, and at least some of the protein-RNA complexes would then be transported into the cytosol in association with the endosome-like vesicular organelles. These findings provide new insight into the mechanism of SINV replication and virus-host cell interactions.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.01011-08",""

We determined whether chemotherapy (genotoxic stress) could induce expression of VEGF and VEGF receptors (VEGFR) in human colorectal cancer cells. The colorectal cancer cell lines HT29, RKO, and HCT116 were acutely exposed to increasing doses of oxaliplatin or 5-fluorouracil for 2, 6, and 24 h in vitro. Expression of VEGF ligand family members, VEGFRs, and signaling intermediates was determined by reverse transcription-PCR and Northern and Western blotting. The effect of oxaliplatin on VEGF-A transcriptional activity was determined by promoter assays. Acute exposure of human colorectal cancer cells to oxaliplatin led to a marked induction of VEGF-A mRNA and protein, whereas 5-fluorouracil alone or when added to oxaliplatin did not cause a further increase in VEGF levels. VEGF-A promoter activity was induced by oxaliplatin exposure. Expression of VEGF-C, placental growth factor, VEGFR-1, and neuropilin-1 levels were also increased when cells were treated with oxaliplatin. Oxaliplatin led to an increase in Akt and Src activation in HT29 cells. In contrast, Akt activation did not change in RKO cells whereas phospho-Src and phospho-p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase was dramatic increased by oxaliplatin. Inhibition of Akt or Src activation with wortmannin or PP2 blocked induction of VEGF-A by oxaliplatin in HT29 or RKO cells, respectively. VEGFRs may reflect the adaptive stress responses by which tumor cells attempt to protect themselves from genotoxic stress. Neutralization of prosurvival responses with anti-VEGF therapy might explain, in part, some of the beneficial effects of anti-VEGF therapy when added to chemotherapy.

A diagnosis of monophasic synovial sarcoma was favored initially. The tumor cells in the resection specimen were positive for myosin, myogenin, and MyoD1. Fluorescence in situ hybridization performed on the resection specimen showed no evidence of SYT gene rearrangement in the neoplastic cells, ruling out monophasic synovial sarcoma. A diagnosis of SSRMS was established. The patient succumbed to widely metastatic disease 16 months after initial diagnosis. This case highlights the utility of skeletal muscle markers and cytogenetic testing in distinguishing SSRMS from its mimic, monophasic synovial sarcoma. It is hoped that this case will expand the literature on adult SSRMS and help clinicians and pathologists better understand this newly described entity.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1066896908327166",""

Further, a correlation study and analysis of variance were performed using the system assigned grades and the technician assigned grades, and these initial results are very promising.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0040517507090786",""

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and micro-Raman scattering show that amorphous Ge nanodots are formed at all temperatures. The formation of amorphous Ge nanodots is different from reported crystalline Ge nanodot formation by high energy ion implantation followed by a necessary high temperature annealing process. At room temperature, a confined spatial distribution of the amorphous Ge nanodots can be obtained. Ge inward diffusion was found to be significantly enhanced by a synergetic effect of high implantation temperature and preferential sputtering of surface oxygen, which induced a much wider and deeper Ge nanodot distribution at elevated implantation temperature. The bimodal size distribution that is often observed in high energy implantation was not observed in the present study. Cross-sectional TEM observation and the depth profile of Ge atoms in SiO2 obtained from x-ray photoelectron spectra revealed a critical Ge concentration for observable amorphous nanodot formation.

In this paper, a comprehensive examination of the vocal repertoire of Mexican free-tailed bats, T. brasiliensis, is presented. Syllable acoustics and temporal emission patterns for 16 types of vocalizations including courtship song revealed three main findings. First, although in some cases syllables are unique to specific calls, other syllables are shared among different calls. Second, entire calls associated with one behavior can be embedded into more complex vocalizations used in entirely different behavioral contexts. Third, when different calls are composed of similar syllables, distinctive temporal emission patterns may facilitate call recognition. These results indicate that syllable acoustics alone do not likely provide enough information for call recognition; rather, the acoustic context and temporal emission patterns of vocalizations may affect meaning.","https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article-pdf/124/3/1838/15289251/1838_1_online.pdf",""

LEO satellites typically complete a revolution around the Earth in less than four hours at an altitude of a few hundred miles and are part of the critical infrastructure for natural resource management, crop yield estimation, meteorology, flood control, communication, and space research. Because these satellites are quite expensive to launch and operate, utilizing them in the best possible manner is of paramount importance for the agencies that own them. A ground station provides support time to a satellite to perform a variety of tasks when the satellite is visible to the station over a prespecified planning horizon; the payoff from providing such support is a function of the support time. When two or more satellites pass over the ground station, their visibility time windows may overlap. Thus, under overlapping visibilities, a relevant problem is that of scheduling ground station support time for each satellite with the objective of maximizing the total utility generated from supporting the satellites. We propose four basic scheduling models to address a variety of scenarios and investigate their computational complexities. For each model, we also identify special cases that are polynomially solvable.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3401/poms.1080.0016",""

First, we tested the hypothesis that TBI increases nitrotyrosine (NT) immunoreactivity in the brain by measuring the number of NT-immunoreactive neurons in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of rats subjected to parasagittal fluid-percussion TBI. Second, we tested the hypothesis that treatment with l-arginine, a substrate for nitric oxide synthase, further increases NT immunoreactivity over TBI alone. Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and subjected to TBI, sham TBI, or TBI followed by treatment with l-arginine (100 mg/kg). Twelve, 24, or 72 h after TBI, brains were harvested. Coronal sections (10 μm) were incubated overnight with rabbit polyclonal anti-NT antibody, rinsed, and incubated with a biotinylated secondary antibody. The antigen—antibody complex was visualized using a peroxidase-conjugated system with diaminobenzidine as the chromagen. The number of NT-positive cortical and hippocampal neurons increased significantly in both ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres up to 72 h after TBI compared with the sham-injured group. Remarkably, treatment with l-arginine reduced the number of NT-positive neurons after TBI in both cortex and hippocampus.

We hypothesize that direct injection of fresh surgical specimen of MB and high-grade glioma tissues into anatomically equivalent locations in immune-deficient mouse brains will facilitate the formation of clinically accurate xenograft tumors by allowing brain tumor stem cells, together with their non-stem tumor and stromal cells, to grow in a microenvironment that is the closest to human brains. Eight of the 14 MBs (57.1%) and two of the three high-grade gliomas (66.7%) in this study developed transplantable (up to 12 passages) xenografts in mouse cerebellum and cerebrum, respectively. These xenografts are patient specific, replicating the histopathologic, immunophenotypic, invasive/metastatic, and major genetic (analyzed with 10K single nucleotide polymorphism array) abnormalities of the original tumors. The xenograft tumor cells have also been successfully cryopreserved for long-term preservation of tumorigenicity, ensuring a sustained supply of the animal models. More importantly, the CD133+ tumor cells, ranging from 0.2%–10.4%, were preserved in all the xenograft models following repeated orthotopic subtransplantations in vivo. The isolated CD133+ tumor cells formed neurospheres and displayed multi-lineage differentiation capabilities in vitro. In summary, our study demonstrates that direct orthotopic transplantation of fresh primary tumor cells is a powerful approach in developing novel clinical relevant animal models that can reliably preserve CD133+ tumor cell pools even during serial in vivo subtransplantations.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1634/stemcells.2007-1009",""

The velocity structures of the Late Cretaceous Aves Ridge remnant arc and Miocene and younger Lesser Antilles arc are remarkably similar, which implies that magmatic processes have remained moderately steady over time. Crustal thickness is ∼26 km at the Aves Ridge and ∼24 km at the Lesser Antilles arc. In comparison to the Izu‐Bonin and Aleutian arcs, the Lesser Antilles arc is thinner and has no evidence for a lower crustal cumulate layer, which is consistent with the estimated low magma production rates of the Lesser Antilles arc. Crustal thickness beneath the Grenada and Tobago basins is 4–10 km, and the velocity structure suggests that these basins could be floored by oceanic crust. A decrease of ∼1 km/s in average seismic velocity of the upper crust is observed from NW to SE across the North Coast fault zone; we argue that this marks the suture between the far‐traveled Caribbean arc and the passive margin of the South American continent. Current strike‐slip motion between the Caribbean and South American plates is located ∼30 km to the south, and thus material originally deposited on the South American passive margin has now been transferred to the Caribbean plate.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2007JB005373",""

In this study, we investigate the atmospheric planetary boundary layer response to TIW‐induced SST variations in the tropical Atlantic Ocean using Community Atmosphere Model version 3 (CAM3) developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and compare the model simulation with available satellite measurements. CAM3 is used to simulate the response to Atlantic TIWs with T85 and T42 horizontal resolutions forced with daily Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission microwave imager (TMI) SSTs and T85 horizontal resolution forced with weekly TMI and Reynolds SSTs. All four runs exhibit an atmospheric response to the SST anomalies, but the amplitude of the response is different in each case. The model simulates winds, convergence, column‐integrated water vapor, and precipitation perturbations associated with TIWs that are similar in many respects to the satellite observations. However, the wind convergence and divergence anomalies in the satellite observations are located west of the SST anomalies. In the CAM3 simulations the wind convergence is more in phase with SST anomalies. Differences between the observations and the model simulations appear to be due to both differences in the boundary layer response and differences in the horizontal advection process.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2007JD009474",""

Previous research examining only the mature stage of an MCS showed that the overwhelming majority of VHF lightning sources occurred in the convective region with a lightning pathway extending rearward and descending in altitude into the stratiform region. This descending pathway was most likely associated with small, charged ice particles advected from the convective line. Unlike previous research, the lightning pathway observed during the evolution of the MCS on 31 October 2005 initially extended rearward 40 km at a nearly constant height of 9–10 km. In less than an hour, the lightning pathway evolved into a sloped pathway, similar to that found by previous research, with a horizontal extent between 50 to 60 km and downward descent of 4 to 5 km. During the lightning pathway evolution, radar analysis showed an increase of reflectivity in the midlevels of the stratiform region, consistent with increased depositional and aggregational growth above the melting layer. Broadening (increased range of values) of radar reflectivity above the melting layer was most likely an indication of a strengthening mesoscale updraft in the stratiform region. This strengthening updraft may have contributed to an increase in the growth of the small, charge carrying ice crystals giving them a greater fall speed. In addition, the mesoscale updraft may have promoted an environment conducive to local stratiform region charge generation in the mixed phase region just above the melting layer.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2007JD008445",""

The leptin receptor (Lepr) is expressed in discrete regions of the brain; among the sites of highest expression are several mediobasal hypothalamic nuclei known to play a role in energy homeostasis, including the arcuate nucleus, the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH), and the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus. Although most studies have focused on leptin’s actions in the arcuate nucleus, the role of Lepr in these other sites has received less attention. To explore the role of leptin signaling in the VMH, we used bacterial artificial chromosome transgenesis to target Cre recombinase to VMH neurons expressing steroidogenic factor 1, thereby inactivating a conditional Lepr allele specifically in steroidogenic factor 1 neurons of the VMH. These knockout (KO) mice, designated Lepr KOVMH, exhibited obesity, particularly when challenged with a high-fat diet. On a low-fat diet, Lepr KOVMH mice exhibited significantly increased adipose mass even when their weights were comparable to wild-type littermates. Furthermore, these mice exhibited a metabolic syndrome including hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia, and hyperleptinemia. Lepr KOVMH mice were hyperinsulinemic from the age of weaning and eventually developed overt glucose intolerance. These data define nonredundant roles of the Lepr in VMH neurons in energy homeostasis and provide a model system for studying other actions of leptin in the VMH.","http://academic.oup.com/endo/article-pdf/149/5/2138/8997790/endo2138.pdf",""

However, the current procedure in the Highway Capacity Manual 2000 (HCM) for analyzing actuated signalized intersections treats pedestrian crossing and timing statically, with either pedestrian calls at all signal cycles or no pedestrians at all. In reality, pedestrian arrivals are random events with some cycles having more pedestrians than others and other cycles having no pedestrian call at all. This paper demonstrates that the current procedure can lead to erroneous results in capacity and delay estimations. A model is introduced to overcome the shortcomings in the current procedure. The model takes into account the stochastic nature of pedestrian crossings and their effects. The model computes the probability of having pedestrian calls in a cycle and the corresponding capacities and delays for traffic movements. An implementation framework was developed to help practitioners conduct capacity analyses using the model. The model's results on a semiactuated signal-controlled intersection were comparable with the results from the SimTraffic microsimulation model. The effects of pedestrians on intersection capacity and delay were analyzed using the proposed model. Depending on the pedestrian volume and traffic conditions, the current HCM procedure could produce significant error, especially when the pedestrian volume is low, because it does not consider the stochastic nature of pedestrian arrivals.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/2071-15",""

They experience a unique set of stressors that contribute to a diminishment of many immune responses. This study investigated the ability of the shuttle crew members' monocytes to respond to gram-negative endotoxin that they could encounter during infections. Blood specimens were collected from 20 crew members and 15 control subjects 10 days before launch, 3 to 4 h after landing, and 15 days after landing and from crew members during their annual medical examination at 6 to 12 months after landing. When challenged with gram-negative endotoxin, the crew member's monocytes collected at all three time points produced lower levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-1β and higher levels of IL-1ra and IL-8 compared to those of control subjects. Cytokines were assessed by measuring the number of cells positive for intracellular cytokines. These values returned to normal 6 to 12 months after landing, except for IL-1ra, which was still higher (five- to sixfold) than in controls. This phenomenon was accompanied by an increased expression of Toll-like receptor 4 and decreased expression of CD14 on the crew members' monocytes at all time points. There were also increased levels of the lipopolysaccharide binding protein in the plasma of the crew members 3 to 4 h and 15 days after landing. This study shows that spaceflight-associated factors (in-flight and preflight) modulate the response of monocytes to gram-negative endotoxins.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/CVI.00065-08",""

A series of numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate how the fault threshold policy needs to be adjusted to changes in system complexity, team skill, development environment, and project schedule.

However, results from the Multicenter Study of HU suggested that clinical symptoms often improved before a significant increase in HbF levels occurred. This indicated that HU may be acting through the modification of additional cellular mechanisms that are yet to be identified. Hence, in this study, we focused on the analysis of the sickle RBC membrane proteome +/− HU treatment. 2D-DIGE (Two Dimensional Difference In-Gel Electrophoresis) technology and tandem mass spectrometry has been used to determine quantitative differences between sickle cell membrane proteins in the presence and absence of a clinically relevant concentration of HU. In vitro protein profiling of 13 sickle RBC membrane samples +/− 50 μM HU identified 10 statistically significant protein spots. Of these, the most remarkable class of proteins to show a statistically significant increase was the anti-oxidant enzymes—catalase, thioredoxin peroxidase and biliver-din reductase and the chaperonin containing TCP1 complex assisting in the folding of RBC cytoskeletal proteins. Interestingly, catalase immunoblots showed an increase in the acidic forms of the enzyme within sickle RBC membranes on incubation with 50 μM HU. We further identified this modification in catalase to be phosphorylation and demonstrated that HU exposed SS RBC membranes showed a 2-fold increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of catalase as compared to counterparts not exposed to HU. These results present an attractive model for HU-induced post-translational modification and potential activation of catalase in mature sickle RBCs. These findings also identify protein targets of HU other than fetal hemoglobin and enhance the understanding of the drug mechanism.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3181/0805-S-149",""

The objectives of this study were to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which diallyl trisulfide (DATS) enhanced the therapeutic potential of tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in prostate cancer cells in vitro and on orthotopically transplanted PC-3 prostate carcinoma in nude mice. DATS inhibited cell viability and colony formation and induced apoptosis in PC-3 and LNCaP cells. DATS enhanced the apoptosis-inducing potential of TRAIL in PC-3 cells and sensitized TRAIL-resistant LNCaP cells. Dominant-negative FADD inhibited the synergistic interaction between DATS and TRAIL on apoptosis. DATS induced the expression of DR4, DR5, Bax, Bak, Bim, Noxa, and PUMA and inhibited expression of Mcl-1, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, survivin, XIAP, cIAP1, and cIAP2. Oral administration of DATS significantly inhibited growth of orthotopically implanted prostate carcinoma in BALB/c nude mice compared with the control group, without causing weight loss. Cotreatment of mice with DATS and TRAIL was more effective in inhibiting prostate tumor growth and inducing DR4 and DR5 expression, caspase-8 activity, and apoptosis than either agent alone. DATS inhibited angiogenesis (as measured by CD31-positive and factor VIII–positive blood vessels and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, vascular endothelial growth factor, and interleukin-6 expression) and metastasis [matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-7, MMP-9, and MT-1 MMP expression], which were correlated with inhibition in AKT and nuclear factor-κB activation. The combination of DATS and TRAIL was more effective in inhibiting markers of angiogenesis and metastasis than either agent alone. These data suggest that DATS can be combined with TRAIL for the prevention and/or treatment of prostate cancer.

Various combinations of organs (total lungs, heart, spinal cord, external body surface) were used to generate the basis set used in the calculations for deformations. The external surface contour did not have a noticeable effect on the dose calculation. Total lung, heart, and spinal cord together provided an adequate set of deformation organs to generate accurate dose deformations. The magnitude of the calculated dose differences had no obvious relationship to tumor parameters, including site, histologic type, disease stage, extent of motion, or degree of centralization.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1120%2Fjacmp.v9i2.2794",""

This is particularly advantageous in insect and disease outbreaks, in which the process may last several years, with varying levels of intensity.

We identified a mER in Atlantic croaker ovaries with characteristics similar to those of human GPR30. To confirm the proposed role of GPR30 as a mER in this distantly related vertebrate group, we cloned GPR30 from croaker ovaries and examined its distribution, steroid binding, and signaling characteristics. Western blot analysis showed the GPR30 protein (∼40 kDa) is expressed on the plasma membranes of croaker oocytes and HEK293 cells stably transfected with GPR30 cDNA. Plasma membranes prepared from croaker GPR30-transfected cells displayed high-affinity, limited-capacity, and displaceable binding specific for estrogens, characteristic of mERs. Consistent with previous findings with human GPR30, estrogen treatment of plasma membranes from both croaker ovaries and GPR30-transfected cells caused activation of a stimulatory G protein (Gs) resulting in increased cAMP production. Treatment with E2 as well as G-1, a specific GPR30 ligand, significantly reduced both spontaneous and progestin-induced maturation of both croaker and zebrafish oocytes in vitro, suggesting a possible involvement of GPR30 in maintaining oocyte meiotic arrest in these species. Injection of antisense oligonucleotides to GPR30 into zebrafish oocytes blocked the inhibitory effects of estrogen on oocyte maturation, confirming a role for GPR30 in the control of meiotic arrest. These findings further support our previous suggestion that GPR30 is a vertebrate mER. In addition, the results suggest GRP30 may play a critical role in regulating reentry into the meiotic cell cycle in fish oocytes.","http://academic.oup.com/endo/article-pdf/149/7/3410/8999351/endo3410.pdf",""

To assess food safety knowledge and food handling behaviors of low-income, high-risk populations, a study was conducted with participants of the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). A survey was conducted with 1,598 clients from 87 WIC agencies nationwide. Descriptive statistics, chi-square analyses, t tests, and analyses of variance were calculated. A majority of respondents received food safety information from WIC (78.7%), family (63.1%), and television (60.7%). Most respondents recognized the necessity for washing and sanitizing cutting boards and utensils (94.3%), but only 66.1% knew the correct ways to sanitize. Using a thermometer to ensure doneness of meat was least recognized (23.7%) and used by even fewer respondents (7.7%). The majority (77.4%) used color of meat and/or juices when checking the doneness of ground beef items. Over half of the respondents (58.4%) used acceptable thawing methods, but many thawed frozen meats on the counter (21.0%) or in a sink filled with water (20.6%). There were significant differences in thawing methods, overall knowledge scores, and overall behavior scores among different racial and ethnic groups. White respondents had higher knowledge scores than did Hispanics, and blacks had lower behavior scores than did individuals in the other racial and ethnic groups. Results of the study suggested the need for food safety education for low-income consumers and different messages to be delivered to specific demographic groups.","http://meridian.allenpress.com/jfp/article-pdf/71/8/1651/1679261/0362-028x-71_8_1651.pdf",""

We generated an nsp1 mutant (nsp1-mt) that neither promoted host mRNA degradation nor suppressed host protein synthesis in expressing cells. Both a SARS-CoV mutant virus, encoding the nsp1-mt protein (SARS-CoV-mt), and a wild-type virus (SARS-CoV-WT) replicated efficiently and exhibited similar one-step growth kinetics in susceptible cells. Both viruses accumulated similar amounts of virus-specific mRNAs and nsp1 protein in infected cells, whereas the amounts of endogenous host mRNAs were clearly higher in SARS-CoV-mt-infected cells than in SARS-CoV-WT-infected cells, in both the presence and absence of actinomycin D. Further, SARS-CoV-WT replication strongly inhibited host protein synthesis, whereas host protein synthesis inhibition in SARS-CoV-mt-infected cells was not as efficient as in SARS-CoV-WT-infected cells. These data revealed that nsp1 indeed promoted host mRNA degradation and contributed to host protein translation inhibition in infected cells. Notably, SARS-CoV-mt infection, but not SARS-CoV-WT infection, induced high levels of beta interferon (IFN) mRNA accumulation and high titers of type I IFN production. These data demonstrated that SARS-CoV nsp1 suppressed host innate immune functions, including type I IFN expression, in infected cells and suggested that SARS-CoV nsp1 most probably plays a critical role in SARS-CoV virulence.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.02472-07",""

Experimental data show that the critical aspect ratio of the HSQ lines dramatically increase when the line pitch reduced to sub-100-nm, which is opposite to theoretical models for capillary forces and swelling strain. Such contradiction can be well explained only if Young’s modulus is considered as a significantly varying factor. Further, experimental data show a dramatic decrease in swelling strain and increase in oxygen contents in HSQ with increasing EBL dose, indicating that it is the change in Young’s modulus rather than the capillary force or swelling strain that dominates the instability behaviors at the nanoscale. Stable high aspect ratio HSQ nanolines over metal pads were used to make working Si nanowire transistors on Si on insulator substrates. 12–14nm HSQ lines with aspect ratios of 11–14 have been obtained.

Here, we show that a subset of B lymphocytes (termed B-1 population), but not other lymphocytes, has prometastatic effects on melanoma cells in vivo through a direct heterotypic cell-cell interaction. In the classic B16 mouse melanoma model, one mechanism underlying this phenomenon is a specific up-regulation and subsequent homophilic interaction mediated by the cell surface glycoprotein MUC18 (also known as melanoma cell adhesion molecule). Presence of B-1 lymphocytes in a panel of tumor samples from melanoma patients directly correlates with MUC18 expression in melanoma cells, indicating that the same protein interaction exists in humans. These results suggest a new but as yet unrecognized functional role for host B-1 lymphocytes in tumor metastasis and establish a biochemical basis for such observations. Our findings support the counterintuitive central hypothesis in which a primitive layer of the immune system actually contributes to tumor progression and metastasis in a mouse model and in melanoma patients. Given that monoclonal antibodies against MUC18 are in preclinical development but the reason for their antitumor activity is not well understood, these translational results are relevant in the setting of human melanoma and perhaps of other cancers.

It is known that the proper assembly of molecules can implement an entire numerical processing system based on digital or even analogical computation. In turn, the outputs of this molecular processing unit need to be amplified in order to be useful. We have developed a nanomicrointerface to read information encoded in molecular level potentials and to amplify this signal to microelectronic levels. The amplification is performed by making the output molecular potential slightly twist the torsional angle between two rings of a pyridazine, 3,6-bis(phenylethynyl) (aza-OPE) molecule, requiring only fractions of kcal/mol energies.

Adult male Sprague—Dawley rats were subjected to exercise on a treadmill for 3 weeks. A 2-h middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion was administered to exercised and nonexercised animals to induce stroke. Exercised ischemic rats were subjected to TNF-α inhibition and ERK1/2 by TNF-α antibody or UO126. Nissl staining of coronal sections revealed the infarct volume. Evans blue extravasation and water content evaluated BBB function. Western blot was performed to analyze protein expression of TNF-α, ERK1/2, phosphorylated ERK1/2, the basal laminar protein collagen IV, and MMP-9. The activity of MMP-9 was determined by gelatin zymography. Tumor necrosis factor-α expression and ERK1/2 phosphorylation were upregulated during exercise.

Most current commercial designs are symmetric CMPs in which each core is identical and range from a relatively simple RISC pipeline to a large and complicated out-of-order x86 core. When the granularity of parallelism in the tasks matches the granularity of the processing cores, a CMP will be at its most efficient. To adjust the granularity of a core to the tasks running on it, recent research has proposed flexible-core chip multiprocessors, which typically consist of a number of small processing cores that can be aggregated to form larger logical processors. These architectures introduce a new resource allocation and scheduling problem which must determine how many logical processors should be configured, how powerful each processor should be, and where/when each task should run. This paper introduces and motivates this new scheduling problem, describes the challenges associated with it, and examines and evaluates several algorithms (amenable to implementation in an operating system) appropriate for such flexible-core CMPs. We also describe how scheduling for flexible-core architectures differs from scheduling for fixed multicore architectures, and compare the performance of flexible-core CMPs to both symmetric and asymmetric fixed-core CMPs.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1399972.1399981",""

Previously, we identified a relationship between elevated tissue IGF-I levels and enhanced susceptibility to chemically induced skin tumorigenesis. In this study, liver IGF-I–deficient (LID) mice, which have a 75% reduction in serum IGF-I, were subjected to the standard two-stage skin carcinogenesis protocol using 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene as the initiator and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) as the promoter. We observed a significant reduction in epidermal thickness and labeling index in LID mice treated with either vehicle or TPA. A significant decrease in both tumor incidence and tumor multiplicity was observed in LID mice undergoing two-stage skin carcinogenesis relative to wild-type littermates. Western blot analyses of epidermal extracts revealed reduced activation of both the epidermal growth factor and IGF-I receptors in response to TPA treatment in LID mice. In addition, reduced activation of both Akt and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was observed in LID mice following TPA treatment relative to wild-type controls. Signaling downstream of mTOR was also reduced. These data suggest a possible mechanism whereby reduced circulating IGF-I leads to attenuated activation of the Akt and mTOR signaling pathways, and thus, diminished epidermal response to tumor promotion, and ultimately, two-stage skin carcinogenesis. The current data also suggest that reduced circulating IGF-I levels which occur as a result of calorie restriction may lead to the inhibition of skin tumorigenesis, at least in part, by a similar mechanism.

To determine whether genetic variations of IGF modify pancreatic cancer risk, we compared the frequency of six single nucleotide polymorphisms of IGF1 and IGF2 in a large-scale case control study. Single nucleotide polymorphisms were investigated using the TaqMan method in 892 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and 783 healthy controls who were recruited from The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center from 2000 to 2007. Cases and controls were frequency matched by age (±5 years), race, and sex. Risk factor information was collected using direct interviews. We estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) using unconditional multivariate logistic regression models. A haplotype of IGF1 gene containing the 3′-UTR Ex4 -177 G&gt;C G allele had a significantly lower frequency in cases (0.027) than in controls (0.041; P = 0.039). A statistically significant joint effect of the IGF1 3′-UTR Ex4 -177 G&gt;C C allele and diabetes on pancreatic cancer risk was observed. The OR (95% CI) were 1.07 (0.81-1.42), 2.12 (1.53-2.93), and 5.69 (2.63-12.3) for individuals who had the CC/CG genotype alone, diabetes alone, or both factors, respectively, compared with subjects without either of the two factors with adjustment for other risk factors.

However, soft water is not always available, and softening hard brines may be very costly or infeasible in many cases depending on the location, the brine composition and other factors. For instance, conventional ASP uses sodium carbonate to reduce the adsorption of the surfactant and generate soap in-situ by reacting with acidic crude oils; however, calcium carbonate precipitates unless the brine is soft. A form of borax known as metaborate has been found to sequester divalent cations such as Ca++ and prevent precipitation. This approach has been combined with the screening and selection of surfactant formulations that will perform well with brines with high salinity and hardness. We demonstrate this approach in this paper by combining high performance, low cost surfactants with co-surfactants that increase salinity and hardness tolerance with metaborate. Chemical formulations containing surfactants and alkali in hard brine were screened for performance and tolerance using microemulsion phase behavior experiments and crude at reservoir temperature. A formulation was found that with an optimum salinity of 120,000 ppm TDS (with 6600 ppm divalent cations) that performed well in core floods with high oil recovery and almost zero final chemical flood residual oil saturation. Additionally, chemical formulations containing sodium metaborate and hard brine gave nearly 100% oil recovery, with no indication of precipitate formation. Metaborate chemistry was incorporated into the mechanistic UTCHEM simulator and the simulator was then used to model the core floods. Overall, novel ASP with metaborate performed comparable to conventional ASP using sodium carbonate in soft water, demonstrating advancements in ASP adaptation to hard, saline reservoirs without the need for soft brine, which increases the number of oil reservoirs that are candidates for enhanced oil recovery using ASP flooding.","https://onepetro.org/SPEATCE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/116754-MS/2736708/spe-116754-ms.pdf",""

Several critical design issues were identified that apply to high speed wound field synchronous generators and turbine drive systems. The focus of the paper is directed to the more aggressive designs that, like ALPS, are intended to maximize the power density of the turbine/generator package. Design issues addressed by the paper include: • Thermal management for the armature and field windings; • Structural support and insulation of the rotating field winding; • Design of the brushless exciter and rotating diode array; • Design of the rotor bearings, seals, and dampers; • System dynamic response to sudden load changes. The results of trade studies for selection of the generator technology (wound field, permanent magnet, high temperature superconducting) will also be presented to identify key size/weight and cost drivers in the design process. Lessons learned during the fabrication, assembly, and testing of the ALPS generator will be discussed in this paper, in particular, issues concerning the high pressure stator air cooling system, improvements to the field winding insulation, and field coil installation techniques will be addressed.

The model simulates an offender as an intelligent agent of MAS that interacts with the target and place automata of CA. The likelihood of a residential burglary is modeled as a function of offender’s motivation, target desirability and place guardianship, which in turn are determined by the offender’s individual characteristics often used by RA and the target and place’s neighborhood properties frequently utilized in SD. The model was initialized and parameterized using “real” crime data from Dallas, Texas Police Department. Results under two different weighting scenarios were obtained and compared with the actual distribution of offense locations, revealing the flexibility of model in its capability to assessing the influence of the two theories in burglary crime simulation.

The double-strand break repair is a major DNA-repair pathway. This study tested the hypothesis that common sequence variants of the double-strand break pathway genes predispose susceptible individuals to an increased risk for renal cell carcinoma. Toward this end, we evaluated the associations of 13 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 10 candidate genes involved in the double-strand break pathway with renal cell carcinoma risk in a population-based case-control study that included 326 Caucasian renal cell carcinoma patients and 335 controls. Using the homozygous wild type as the reference group, we observed a significantly increased renal cell carcinoma risk associated with the homozygous variant genotype of NBS1 (rs1805794; odds ratio, 2.13; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.17-3.86). Carrying of at least one copy of the variant XRCC4 allele was also associated with a significantly increased risk (rs1805377; odds ratio, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.08-2.26). Importantly, in pathway analysis, compared with the reference group (1 or less adverse alleles), individuals with two (odds ratio, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.83-1.91), three (odds ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.64-1.56), and more than three adverse alleles (odds ratio, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.03-2.98) were at increased risk for renal cell carcinoma with significant association in subjects carrying more than 3 adverse alleles. Results from this study provide evidence that individuals with a higher number of genetic variations in the DBS repair pathway are at an increased risk for renal cell carcinoma. These findings require further validation in independent populations. (Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 2008;17(9):2366–73)","https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article-pdf/17/9/2366/2267475/2366.pdf",""

A reliable assessment of this petrophysical property is possible when rock-core measurements of Archie’s parameters, such as saturation exponent [Formula: see text] and cementation exponent [Formula: see text], are available. In addition, chemical analysis of formation water is necessary to measure connate-water resistivity [Formula: see text]. Such measurements are seldom available in most applications; if they are available, their reliability may be questionable. We describe a new inversion method to estimate [Formula: see text] and Archie’s cementation exponent from the combined use of borehole spontaneous-potential (SP) and raw array-induction resistivity measurements acquired in water-bearing depth intervals. Combined inversion of resistivity and SP measurements is performed assuming a piston-like invasion profile. In so doing, the reservoiris divided into petrophysical layers to account for vertical heterogeneities. Inversion products are values of invaded and virgin formation resistivity, radius of invasion, and static spontaneous potential (SSP). Connate-water resistivity is calculated by assuming membrane and diffusion potentials as the main contributors to the SSP. Archie’s or dual-water equations enable the estimation of [Formula: see text]. The new combined estimation method has been successfully applied to a data set acquired in a clastic formation. Data were acquired in a high permeability and moderately high-salt-concentration reservoir. Values of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] yielded by the inversion are consistent with those obtained with a traditional interpretation method, thereby confirming the reliability of the estimation. The method is an efficient, rigorous alternative to conventional interpretation techniques for performing petrophysical analysis of exploratory and appraisal wells wherein rock-core measurements may not be available.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/1.2890408",""

Therefore, it is of utmost importance to understand the interaction of OBMs as they contact shales. Past research (Chenevert 1970) has shown how the movement of water from OBMs can be controlled by the addition of salt. This paper deals with the movement of the oil phase of the OBM, as described by its hydraulic ""Entrance Pressure."" Although the oil filtrate of the OBM does not hydrate the shale, it can penetrate and flow into the shale at a certain entrance pressure. Such flow into shale can be as damaging as water flow, because it increases the pore pressure of the shale, which can cause wellbore failure. It is of primary interest to understand this when using OBMs in shales. It is also important to understand how factors such as the emulsifier concentration in the OBM and the porosity of the shale affect this entrance pressure.","https://onepetro.org/SPEATCE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/116364-MS/2735664/spe-116364-ms.pdf",""

When these conditions are not met, non-Archie electrical behavior arises whereby relationships among rock resistivity, porosity, and water saturation no longer exhibit power-law dependence. Currently, such an unreliable behavior of empirical laws can be quantified only through pore-scale modeling of electrical conductivity under specific sets of geometric assumptions and with substantial computation memory requirements. We introduce a new geometric concept to simulate direct-current electrical-conductivity phenomena in arbitrary rock models on the basis of 3D grain and pore objects that include explicit distributions of intragranular porosity, clay-exchange cations, nonwetting fluid blobs, thin films, and pendular rings. These objects are distributed in the pore space following simple heuristic principles of drainage/imbibition that honorcapillary-pressure curves. They provide a simple way to parameterize the 3D pore space and to calculate the electrical conductivity of porous media saturated with two immiscible fluid phases by way of diffusive random walks within the brine-filled pore space. Not only is the random-walk method memory efficient but it also allows the inclusion of clay/brine cation exchange surfaces otherwise not possible with conventional pore-network models. By comparing results stemming from random-walk, pore-network, and percolation simulations, we show the importance of grain surface roughness and thin film thickness, even in water-wet rocks where those factors usually are neglected. For the case of strongly oil-wet rocks, we show that thin films, snap-offs, and pore microgeometry have a primary impact on hysteresis-dominated rock resistivity during imbibition (increasing water saturation). Our simulation method agrees well overall with percolation simulation results and is advantageously unaffected by assumptions concerning site-percolation imbibition.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/1.2836675",""

During isotropic stressing, samples loaded at elevated temperature exhibit the same sigmoidal stress‐strain curves and non‐linear acoustic emission rates as have previously been observed from room temperature studies on sands, sandstones, and soils. However, results from our hydrothermal experiments show that the critical effective pressure (P*) associated with the onset of significant pore collapse and pervasive cataclastic flow is lower at increased temperature. Samples subjected to triaxial loading at elevated temperature show yield behavior resembling that observed from room temperature studies on granular rocks and soils. When considered in terms of distortional and mean stresses, the yield strength data for a given temperature define an elliptical envelope consistent with critical state and CAP models from soil mechanics. For the conditions we tested, triaxial yield data at low effective pressure are essentially temperature‐insensitive whereas yield levels at high effective pressure are lowered as a function of elevated temperature. We interpret our yield data in a manner consistent with Arrhenius behavior expected for thermally assisted subcritical crack growth. Taken together, our results indicate that increased stresses and temperatures associated with subsurface burial will significantly alter the yield strength of deforming granular media in systematic and predictable ways.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2006JB004710",""

Proline-, glutamic acid–, and leucine–rich protein-1 (PELP1/MNAR) is a novel NR coregulator. Its expression is deregulated in hormone-driven cancers. However, the role of PELP1/MNAR in ovarian cancer progression remains unknown. Analysis of serial analysis of gene expression data suggested deregulation of PELP1/MNAR expression in ovarian tumors. Western analysis of PELP1/MNAR in normal and serous ovarian tumor tissues showed 3- to 4-fold higher PELP1/MNAR expression in serous tumors compared with normal ovarian tissues. To examine the significance of PELP1/MNAR in ovarian cancer progression, we have generated model cells that overexpress PELP1/MNAR and ovarian cancer cells in which PELP1/MNAR expression is down-regulated by stable expression of PELP1/MNAR-specific shRNA. Down-regulation of PELP1/MNAR in cancerous ovarian model cells (OVCAR3) resulted in reduced proliferation, affected the magnitude of c-Src and protein kinase B (AKT) signaling, and reduced tumorigenic potential of ovarian cancer cells in a nude mouse model. PELP1/MNAR overexpression in nontumorigenic immortalized surface epithelial cells (IOSE cells) promoted constitutive activation of c-Src and AKT signaling pathways and promoted anchorage-independent growth. Immunohistochemical studies using human ovarian cancer tissue arrays (n = 123) showed that PELP1/MNAR is 2- to 3-fold overexpressed in 60% of ovarian tumors, and PELP1/MNAR deregulation occurs in all different types of ovarian cancer. Collectively, these results suggest that PELP1/MNAR signaling plays a role in ovarian cancer cell proliferation and survival, and that its expression is deregulated in ovarian carcinomas.

This paper discusses the subgrade stiffness measurements obtained from a new compaction roller for compaction control on highway embankment projects in Kansas. Three test sections were compacted using a single, smooth steel drum intelligent compaction (IC) roller that compacts and simultaneously, measures stiffness values of the compacted soil. Traditional compaction control measurements such as, density, in-situ moisture content, stiffness measurements using a soil stiffness gage, surface deflection tests using the light falling weight deflectometer (LFWD) and falling weight deflectometer (FWD), and penetration tests using a dynamic cone penetrometer (DCP), were also done. The results show that the IC roller was able to identify the locations of lower soil stiffness in the spatial direction. Thus, an IC roller can be used in proof rolling. IC roller stiffness showed sensitivity to the field moisture content indicating that moisture control during compaction is critical. No universal correlation was observed among the IC roller stiffness, soil gage stiffness, back-calculated subgrade moduli from the LFWD and FWD deflection data, and the California bearing ratio obtained from DCP tests. The discrepancy seems to arise from the fact that different pieces of equipment were capturing response from different volumes of soil on the same test section.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/geotechnicaltesting/article-pdf/31/5/442/7081746/10_1520_gtj100971.pdf",""

Stochastic optimization is used to mimic how six independent climate model development efforts might use the same atmospheric general circulation model, set of observational constraints, and model skill criteria to choose different settings for parameters thought to be important sources of uncertainty related to clouds and convection. Each optimized model improved its skill with respect to observations selected as targets of model development. Of particular note were the improvements seen in reproducing observed extreme rainfall rates over the tropical Pacific, which was not specifically targeted during the optimization process. As compared to the default model sensitivity of 2.4°C, the ensemble of optimized model configurations had a larger and narrower range of sensitivities around 3°C but with different regional responses related to the uncertain choice in optimized parameter settings. These results suggest current generation models, if similarly optimized, may become more convergent in their measure of global sensitivity to greenhouse gas forcing. However, this exploration of the possible sources of modeling and observational uncertainty is not exhaustive. The optimization process illustrates an objective means for selecting an ensemble of plausible climate model configurations that quantify a portion of the uncertainty in the climate model development process.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jcli/article-pdf/21/24/6698/3946887/2008jcli2112_1.pdf",""
