In 2014, H. plecostomus, sediment, and water samples were collected during 15 sampling events. A combination of semi-selective enrichment and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) revealed the presence of salmonellae in 45% of the fish intestines across the entire year, with a prevalence range of 13–100% per sampling event. Repetitive element sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) revealed a high diversity of salmonellae from fish intestine samples at individual sampling times, single or multiple presence of rep-PCR patterns and serotypes within individual fish, and identical rep-PCR patterns and serotypes for different fish within and across sampling events. Overall, 15 serotypes were identified by MLST, with a diversity range between one and seven serotypes per sampling event. Some serotypes were retrieved only once, while others were detected more frequently. A few serotypes were retrieved at several sampling times, nearly evenly distributed over the entire sampling period. Prevalence and diversity were independent of precipitation events, indicating the potential presence of environmental strains that are capable of long-term persistence in the environment.","http://iwaponline.com/jwh/article-pdf/16/3/460/245969/jwh0160460.pdf",""

We examined differences in mass of the rumen–reticulum organs in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus (Zimmermann, 1780)) from two sites in Texas, USA, with different diet types. Specifically, at one site deer were fed a pelleted ration and at the other site deer consumed a natural browse diet. Accounting for body mass, deer consuming the browse diet had rumen–reticulum organ masses that were about 1.7 times heavier than deer consuming the pelleted diet. Deer consuming the browse diet also had lower diet quality, as indexed by crude protein concentration, than deer consuming the pelleted diet. The digesta loads of deer, however, were similar for the two types of diet. Our study findings are consistent with increased mass of rumen–reticulum organs from greater bulk, not diet quality.

Acoustic surveys are traditionally performed by human listeners, but automated recording devices (ARD) are becoming increasingly popular. Signal strength decays, or attenuates, with increasing distance between source and receiver and some habitat types may differentially increase attenuation beyond the effects of distance alone. These combined effects are rarely accounted for in acoustic monitoring programs. We evaluated the performance of three playback devices and three ARD models using the calls of six anurans, six birds, and four pure tones. Based on these evaluations, we determined the optimal playback and recording devices. Using these optimal devices, we broadcast and recorded vocalizations in five habitat types along 1,000 m transects. We used generalized linear models to test for effects of habitat, distance, species, environmental, and landscape variables. We predicted detection probabilities for each vocalization, in each habitat type, from 0 to 1,000 m. Among playback devices, only a remote predator caller simulated vocalizations consistently. Differences of ~10 dB were observed among ARDs. For all species, we found differences in detectability between open and closed canopy habitats. We observed large differences in predicted detection probability among species in each habitat type, as well as along 1,000 m transects. Increases in temperature, barometric pressure, and wind speed significantly decreased detection probability. However, aside from differences among species, habitat, and distance, topography impeding a line‐of‐sight between sound source and receiver had the greatest negative influence on detections. Our results suggest researchers should model the effects of habitat, distance, and frequency on detection probability when performing acoustic surveys. To optimize survey design, we recommend pilot measurements among varying habitats.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fece3.4752",""

The ICE is a useful measure for providing the degree to which residents in a certain area are concentrated into groups at the extremes of disadvantage and privilege. We introduce two novel ICE measures (language and nativity), and three existing ICE measures (race/ethnicity, income, and education), which we applied specifically to Texas residents. Methods: We used multivariable mixed‐model Poisson regression analyses to estimate spina bifida birth prevalence and prevalence ratios among singleton live births in Texas, 1999–2014, for each of our ICE measures. Maternal census tract at delivery was included in the models as a random effect. Analyses were stratified by maternal race/ethnicity (Hispanics and non‐Hispanic whites). Live births served as denominators for each category. Results: Among non‐Hispanic white women, those in the most disadvantaged versus the advantaged census tract quintile had adjusted relative risk between 1.6 and 8.5 for having a baby affected by spina bifida. However, Hispanic women in the most disadvantaged versus advantaged census tract quintile for four ICE measures had a 33% to 87% lower risk of having an affected pregnancy. Conclusions: Findings suggest spina bifida risk is associated with neighborhood disadvantage or advantage, and that relationship seems to vary by race‐ethnicity. The varied associations between ICE measures and spina bifida by race/ethnicity highlights the importance of using targeted interventions in the prevention of spina bifida.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fbdr2.1374",""

However, there has not been sufficient study to assess the reliability of these data in deriving human movement. This research aims to evaluate how data collection duration and sample sizes affect the reliability of LBSM data in activity modeling based on two indicators: radius of gyration (ROG) and entropy. We use a linear regression model with logarithmic transformation to approximate how the magnitude of each indicator changes with different data collection durations—from 1 to 12 months. The results indicate that both ROG and entropy increase when the amount of data increases. However, the rate of increase slows down and approaches zero eventually. We also approximated the limit values and verified that with 12‐month data, we are at approximately >95% magnitude of the limit values for both indicators in all three cities. The clustering analysis also demonstrated that there are outlier users who exhibit distinct patterns. This case study focuses on three Chinese cities (Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou) and provides a useful reference to explore the balance point between data effectiveness and an appropriate sample size from LBSM data.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Ftgis.12450",""

MicroRNA 506‐3p (miRNA‐506) was previously identified to be a potent tumor suppressor and induced neuroblastoma cell differentiation. A gene expression array determined that the ATP‐driven proton pump, vacuolar (H+)‐ATPase (V‐ATPase) is directly targeted by the miRNA‐506. However, the role of V‐ATPase in neuroblastoma has not been investigated. We recently found that by using siRNAs to knock down V‐ATPase expression we were able to reduce neuroblastoma proliferation and cell viability. These results warrant further investigation to determine the molecular mechanisms through which V‐ATPase helps mediate the effects of miRNA‐506 on neuroblastoma cells.","",""

Raman studies are used to understand fundamental phonon properties, along with effects related to the crystal structure, disorder, doping, and external factors such as temperature and stress. Micro-Raman extends these investigations to the micron scale. This article reviews diverse benefits of Raman measurements when carried out using laser excitation in the near-ultraviolet wavelength range, nominally 400 to 325 nm. Micro-Raman methods in the near ultraviolet exploit the key advantage of reduced focal spot size, achievable at shorter wavelengths when using diffraction-limited optics, for mapping with high spatial resolution. There are distinct advantages common to Raman and micro-Raman spectroscopy in the near ultraviolet when compared to the widely used visible excitation. One advantage exploits the shallower optical penetration depth in select materials for probing near-surface regions or interfaces. A second advantage is related to tuning of the excitation photon energy relative to the electronic levels of a material for investigating resonance effects. Finally, the application of Raman scattering to materials which exhibit strong fluorescence requires tuning to a wavelength range away from the potentially obscuring emission. This article overviews several examples of these key advantages to study diverse applied physics problems in electronic and photonic materials. Topics covered include stress mapping in silicon and related materials, stress and thermal effects in gallium nitride and other group-III-nitride semiconductors, and carbon materials ranging from graphite and graphene to diamond grown using chemical vapor deposition. The fundamental effects of stress- and temperature-induced shifts in phonon energies and their application to study epitaxy and device-related effects are also briefly reviewed.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.5054660/19743270/041303_1_online.pdf",""

Our study predicts and finds that staff auditors who are coached by supervisors to consider the impact of their work on external financial statement users are more mindful (i.e., more attentive and aware) during an audit and less likely to engage in premature sign-off. The results highlight the importance of workplace mindfulness in an audit environment and suggest that supervisor coaching is a practical technique to elicit workplace mindfulness among staff-level auditors.","https://publications.aaahq.org/cia/article-pdf/13/1/P1/55869/ciia-52324.pdf",""

The present study seeks to assess how race and income independently and synergistically affect the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) from on-road travel across and within counties, using longitudinal data from 3,079 counties in the continental United States. We incorporate these data into a hybrid panel model to test the effect of racial composition over time and across space. We find that, over time, as the percentage of White individuals living in a county increases, the county emits less CO2 from on-road transportation. Across space, counties with more Black residents (as a percentage of total population) emit more on-road CO2 than other counties. To connect our findings with the broader environmental sociological literature, we also explore the interaction of race and affluence, finding that the effect of racial composition is influenced by variation in local affluence across space. Specifically, affluence reduces the correlation between percentage of Black residents and emissions. Conceptually, we argue that through the process of subnational uneven development, environmental privilege manifests as a distinct dimension of environmental racism that affects how specific racial groups experience environmental degradation.","http://online.ucpress.edu/socdev/article-pdf/4/2/217/331793/sod_2018_4_2_217.pdf",""

In general, daylighting systems are an efficient method of delivering light for indoor applications. However, there is little research looking specifically at indoor agriculture applications. Today, optical fibers are commonly used in various applications including imaging, lighting, and sensing. Our study simulated and tested the efficiency of an optical fiber daylighting system in an indoor environment. We tested the illumination performance of optical fibers and specifically looked at light intensity, light uniformity, and the spectrum of 20 mm and 3 mm optical fibers at five distances by offsetting a spectrometer. The scenarios were first modeled and tested using lighting simulation software. Similar settings were then empirically implemented and measured. The results showed that a difference in diameter had an effect on light intensity and light uniformity; the larger the diameter the better the light uniformity and light intensity. Further, the distance at which the spectrometer was placed in reference to the light source showed a relationship between both light intensity and light uniformity; the smaller the distance the more the intensity and the less the uniformity. Additionally, the experiments showed that sunlight intensity was 30 times and 140 times greater than optical fiber output intensity in the absence of any UV filter and presence of UV light, respectively.","http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/jre/2018/9429867.pdf",""

Our results indicate that agencies in states with state laws that are more restrictive or less rewarding to police collect more in federal equitable sharing. This finding supports the critics’ argument that police behavior in regard to forfeiture activities is influenced by the financial rewards and burdens involved. Policy Implications: Our results reveal that the findings of investigative journalism and case study research, that is, that police forfeiture activities are influenced by financial rewards, may be more generalizable to law enforcement than previously thought. Despite recent state‐level reforms, federal equitable sharing and most state forfeiture laws provide limited due process protections and have minimal accountability or reporting requirements. Concerns about the impact of civil forfeiture practices on perceptions of procedural justice and police legitimacy are discussed, and possible policy reforms are reviewed.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2F1745-9133.12341",""

In order to analyze these diradicals, a B3LYP hybrid functional with a 6–31G** basis set was used to predict the electronic energy of each intermediate and transition state in the reaction. The electronic energy values for each step in the reaction were used to construct an energy diagram that quantified the energy gap between the intermediates and transition states. The goal of this experiment was to create an analogue of a dialkynylpyrrole that maximized the energy gap between the diradical singlet and the Retro Bergman transition state, and minimized the energy gap between the diradical singlet and the diradical triplet.

Prior criminal behavior, however, did not relate to better accuracy, despite its relation to psychopathic traits. Results for females were not consistent with findings for males, indicating the finding may not generalize across gender. The current findings suggest one mechanism that might explain why those with elevated psychopathic traits are more likely to offend is that they are adept at identifying vulnerability. However, this was only true for males of the same race as the “victim.”","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0886260518805762",""

It is caused by Rickettsia typhi, which is transmitted to humans by rat and cat fleas. Murine typhus is often a mild illness with nonspecific clinical findings, though delayed treatment may result in severe disease and increased risk of complications. Diagnostic tests have low sensitivity in early disease. Therefore, correctly diagnosing patients with murine typhus is challenging unless clinical suspicion is high. In endemic regions, physicians are aware of the disease and diagnose it readily. However, in areas that have not historically been affected, physicians may be less familiar with the presentation of this rickettsial infection, impacting their ability to diagnose and treat it effectively. Methods: Probable and confirmed murine typhus cases reported in Texas were collected for 1944–2017. Cases were mapped by county for each of the last 5 years. Cases reported over the last 5 years were also geocoded by residence for spatial cluster analysis by year. Results: There has been an overall rise in the number of murine typhus cases reported per year over the last 13 years (Figure 1). The distribution of reported cases throughout Texas has changed over the last 5 years. There continues to be a high number of reported cases in South Texas and Central Texas, while reported cases are increasing in the Harris County/Houston area, Tarrant County/Ft. Worth area, and Dallas County/Dallas area. Spatial cluster (hot spot) analysis of typhus cases in Texas over the last 5 years shows areas of increased risk of murine typhus in South Texas that have persisted over time, while other areas of increased risk have appeared more recently in North Texas and Central Texas (Figures 2 and 3). Conclusion: Murine typhus can be a difficult diagnosis to make based on clinical presentation, and physician awareness of its epidemiology is important. The gradual increase in case counts and the changing distribution of cases within Texas may put patients at risk of missed diagnoses. Recognizing the changing epidemiology of typhus in Texas may help inform public health education and control efforts.

To understand more about how these two groups came into conflict, we interviewed 26 local stakeholders about their views and experiences during the farm code debate and found that issues of race and racial inequality were a key factor in the continuing mistrust. We found that farmers and their supporters attempted to frame the debate and its racial undertones by highlighting their racial–ethnic minority supporters, describing their businesses as reclaiming East Austin’s agricultural past, and arguing that the only issue that should matter in redrawing the farm ordinance should be how to best help farmers provide healthy food to the community. We argue that the farmers’ responses draw from a discourse of whiteness and color blindness that can be harmful to People of Color and link their views to larger critiques that the alternative food movement and individual alternative food projects can be exclusionary.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0160597618814880",""

Young adult offspring (19 females; age = 17–29.5 years) were assessed on depressive symptoms, and mothers (36–51 years) were assessed on negative parenting. Methyl‐binding domain (MBD) sequencing was used to assay genome‐wide DNA methylation in peripheral T lymphocytes. Controlling for the effect of offspring's DNA methylation, mothers' DNA methylation was positively associated with offspring's depression. Hypermethylation of a subset of the epigenetic markers was associated with increased negative parenting. Negative parenting was positively correlated with offspring's depression as well, suggesting that negative parenting may be a modulator between the mother's epigenome and offspring's depression.

This paper reports on the development and validation of the ATSEI, an instrument that measures two domains, Efficacy To Do School Algebra (Knowledge Efficacy, KE‐A) and Efficacy to Teach Algebra (Personal Teaching Efficacy, PTE‐A) along six categories. Four of the categories represented content standards (variables, functions, patterns, and modeling) and two of the categories represented process standards (technology and concrete models, and multiple representations). Through conducting an exploratory factor analysis across two phases, the instrument was reduced and refined from an initial 118 items developed from a curriculum analysis to 36 items that reflected two significant categories, Functions and Technology. The ATSEI measure is validated for in‐service mathematics teachers and thus provides an instrument to examine need and impact in professional development venues. The specificity of the ATSEI allows those working with teachers to be better able to support them in the field and in return positively influence the learning outcomes of the students they teach.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fssm.12291",""

We implemented our approach in a domain-specific code generator that emits optimized CUDA code. Our evaluation shows that, for standard prefix sums and single-stage IIR filters, the generated code reaches the throughput of memory copy for large inputs, which cannot be surpassed. On higher-order prefix sums, it performs nearly as well as the fastest handwritten code from the literature.

Marbling and aging did not interact to affect any of the scores for palatability attributes, their acceptances, or the frequency of their overall eating quality classifications (P < 0.05). Consumers rated HIGH treatments (P < 0.05) as more tender, juicier, and with greater flavor liking and overall liking than MED or LOW, which were similar for all traits (P > 0.05). Aging also influenced (P < 0.05) all traits, as consumers scored 21 d samples greater for all palatability traits than their 42 d counterparts. A greater (P < 0.05) percentage of consumers categorized 42 d samples as ‘unsatisfactory’ and fewer as ‘better than everyday’ or ‘premium quality’ than 21 d samples. A larger proportion of consumers categorized HIGH samples as ‘premium quality’ than MED or LOW and fewer called HIGH ‘good everyday quality’ compared to MED (P < 0.05). Flank streaking, marbling score, and IMF were all influenced (P < 0.01) by marbling category in a linear fashion. Increasing marbling score, more so than flank streaking, was positively linked to increasing eating quality scores. Also, tenderness, juiciness and flavor liking are major drivers for consumer sensory scores for overall liking, with flavor liking having the strongest relationship to overall liking of lamb. Overall, consumers preferred HIGH marbling over LOW and MED marbling loin chops, but had difficulty distinguishing between LOW and MED. Furthermore, extending postmortem aging of lamb loin from 21 to 42 d reduced scores for eating quality traits.","https://www.iastatedigitalpress.com/mmb/article/10338/galley/10571/download/",""

This balance is difficult because each approach requires different allowances for children's agency. Purpose/Objective: This study investigates how district administrators, school administrators, pre-K–3 teachers, and bilingual first graders within a school district serving Latinx immigrant families think about the role of agency in early learning. Setting: Data was collected in Lasso ISD and El Naranjo Elementary School, located on the U.S./Mexico border. Population/Participants: Lasso ISD is predominantly Latinx with 85% of its population self-identifying as Latinx and experiencing financial stress. Over 35% of children at El Naranjo are labeled as English Language Learners. We interviewed five administrators, nine teachers, and 24 children. Research Design: The research method used is a variation of multivocal, video-cued ethnography (VCE). Following VCE's pattern of data collection, we made a film of a typical day in a first-grade classroom where children of Latinx immigrants used agency in their learning. The film was used to elicit perspectives on how much control young children of Latinx immigrants should have over their learning in the early years. Focus group data was analyzed comparatively across participant groups and district hierarchies. Findings: The data reveals an inverse relationship—termed agency diffusion and deficit infusion—between participants’ ideas about the amount of agency students should be afforded in the classroom and the deficit ideas they articulate about children of immigrants and their families. Our findings suggest that even in supportive, academically successful districts, deficit thinking at any level can justify narrow, rote types of instruction that ultimately impact the types of messages young children receive about learning and being a learner. Conclusions/Recommendations: Pre-service and experienced teachers may need help with discriminatory, deficit attitudes toward the families they serve as well as pedagogical skills to offer more agency to children, in the culturally relevant forms that make sense in the classroom. In developing guidelines and policies at school, district, state, and federal levels, agency should be a necessary component of classrooms considered (and labeled) as high quality. Children's perspectives are important ways to determine whether policies and practices are really effective.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/016146811812000608",""

In the contract manufacturing industry, companies often advertise their capabilities and services in an unstructured format on the company website. The unstructured capability data usually portray a realistic view of the services a supplier can offer. If parsed and analyzed properly, unstructured capability data can be used effectively for initial screening and characterization of manufacturing suppliers specially when dealing with a large pool of suppliers. This work proposes a novel framework for capability-based supplier classification that relies on the unstructured capability narratives available on the suppliers' websites. Four document classification algorithms, namely, support vector machine (SVM ), Naïve Bayes, random forest, and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) are used as the text classification techniques. One of the innovative aspects of this work is incorporating a thesaurus-guided method for feature selection and tokenization of capability data. The thesaurus contains the formal and informal vocabulary used in the contract machining industry for advertising manufacturing capabilities. A web-based tool is developed for the generation of the concept vector model associated with each capability narrative and extraction of features from the input documents. The proposed supplier classification framework is validated experimentally through forming two capability classes, namely, heavy component machining and difficult and complex machining, based on real capability data. It was concluded that thesaurus-guided method improves the precision of the classification process.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/computingengineering/article-pdf/doi/10.1115/1.4039553/5997666/jcise_018_03_031009.pdf",""

In this study, we survey the TXST student population about their use, value, and perception of the SMR, a highly used river of which headwaters originate on and flow through campus. From our extensive survey of these students, we find that educational and life experiences matter.

Temperature dependent capacitance–voltage measurement and admittance spectroscopy were used to extract carrier concentration, resistivity, charge carrier mobility, and their temperature dependence. The authors identify the presence of two defect signatures corresponding to carrier freeze-out and the formation of a Schottky back-contact barrier. The back-contact barrier height (≈300 meV) extracted from the temperature dependent current density–voltage (JVT) experiment was confirmed by conventional admittance spectroscopy. The activation energies of mobility (resistivity) are 101.2 ± 2.5 meV (92.6 ± 2.3 meV) and 84.7 ± 2.7 meV (77.6 ± 4.5 meV) for CdS and CdSe buffer layers, respectively. Intensity dependent photoluminescence analysis demonstrates that the CdSe/CdTe device exhibits lower radiative efficiency than the CdS/CdTe device. This confirms the presence of higher defects in the CdSe/CdTe device corroborated by temperature dependent VOC analysis.

One mechanism that may account for this relationship is anxiety sensitivity (AS) cognitive concerns—the fear that cognitive symptoms of anxiety will have catastrophic consequences. We sought to replicate the mediating effect of AS cognitive concerns on the relationship between PTSD symptoms and suicide risk among 214 trauma-exposed male firefighters with non-zero suicide risk. Bootstrap mediation analyses tested AS cognitive concerns as a statistical mediator of PTSD symptoms (total and symptoms clusters scores) and suicide risk, controlling for depression symptoms and relevant demographic variables. AS cognitive concerns statistically mediated the relationship between PTSD symptoms (total score, as well as intrusion, avoidance, and arousal-reactivity symptoms clusters) and suicide risk; however, the reverse was also true. AS cognitive concerns may confer risk for suicide among trauma-exposed firefighters.

The capillary pressure is high in unconventional reservoirs because of the small pores in the rock, so understanding the effect of capillary pressure on phase behavior is necessary for reliable modeling of unconventional shale-gas and tight-oil reservoirs. As the main finding of this paper, first we show that the tangent-plane-distance method cannot be used to determine phase stability and present a rigorous thermodynamic analysis of the problem of phase stability with capillary pressure. Second, we demonstrate that there is a maximum capillary pressure (Pcmax) where calculation of capillary equilibrium using bulk-phase thermodynamics is possible and derive the necessary equations to obtain this maximum capillary pressure. We also briefly discuss the implementation of the capillary equilibrium in a general-purpose compositional reservoir simulator. Two simulation case studies for synthetic gas condensate reservoirs were performed to illustrate the influence of capillary pressure on production behavior for the fluids studied.","http://onepetro.org/SJ/article-pdf/23/06/1977/2111046/spe-175135-pa.pdf",""

Therefore, it is not surprising that they are used to commit different types of illicit activities such as threats or extortions by means of anonymous letters, frauds in the context of disputed contracts, alterations to or counterfeit of ID documents, or counterfeit of currency banknotes. This latter application is of primary interest in this study, where a method to rapidly develop investigative leads is required. Inkjet printed documents produce microscopic colored dots that can be detected using a microscopical approach in conjunction with Raman spectroscopy. The overall goal of this project is to investigate if Raman data gathered from the three cyan, magenta, and yellow microscopic colored dots constitute, in conjunction, a chemical signature of sufficient discriminating quality to provide reliable investigative leads in a time‐effective and nondestructive manner. In the present phase of this study, the criteria necessary to achieve discriminations between inkjet printer inks from different manufacturers, the same manufacturers, and even the same models have been evaluated on a set of 11 samples. Although Raman spectroscopy is already a relatively well‐established method for the characterization of colorants (both dyes and pigments), this study demonstrates that the contribution of minor peaks within Raman spectra improves the discriminating capabilities of the technique. The joint consideration of the three colored components was also effective in differentiating inkjet printer ink samples, especially those from the same manufacturer and in some instances from the same model as well.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fjrs.5458",""

Cell culture studies have suggested an anticancer potential involving multiple cellular processes, including differentiation, apoptosis, senescence, and angiogenesis. In prostate cancer cell models, P53-dependent and independent caspase-mediated apoptosis and androgen receptor (AR) antagonism have been described for bufalin at micromolar concentrations. Because a human pharmacokinetic study indicated that single nanomolar bufalin was safely achievable in the peripheral circulation, we evaluated its cellular activity within range with the AR-positive and P53 wild-type human LNCaP prostate cancer cells in vitro. Our data show that bufalin induced caspase-mediated apoptosis at 20 nmol/L or higher concentration with concomitant suppression of AR protein and its best-known target, PSA and steroid receptor coactivator 1 and 3 (SRC-1, SRC-3). Bufalin exposure induced protein abundance of P53 (not mRNA) and P21CIP1 (CDKN1A), G2 arrest, and increased senescence-like phenotype (SA-galactosidase). Small RNAi knocking down of P53 attenuated bufalin-induced senescence, whereas knocking down of P21CIP1 exacerbated bufalin-induced caspase-mediated apoptosis. In vivo, daily intraperitoneal injection of bufalin (1.5 mg/kg body weight) for 9 weeks delayed LNCaP subcutaneous xenograft tumor growth in NSG SCID mice with a 67% decrease of final weight without affecting body weight. Tumors from bufalin-treated mice exhibited increased phospho-P53 and SA-galactosidase without detectable caspase-mediated apoptosis or suppression of AR and PSA. Our data suggest potential applications of bufalin in therapy of prostate cancer in patients or chemo-interception of prostate precancerous lesions, engaging a selective activation of P53 senescence.

Seven hundred seven children (332 boys and 375 girls) aged between 6 and 10 years participated in the study. Motor Development was determined using the Bruininks–Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency‐Second Edition. Parents answered the Middle Childhood Home Observation Measurement of the Environment (HOME) Inventory, and Brazilian Association of Market Research Institutes Questionnaire (for SES). Children from “Adequate” homes (HOME score), compared with “Less Adequate,” displayed better motor behavior. Mediation and moderation analysis revealed that motor development increased as SES increased. The proportion of variance in motor development explained by SES increased from 9% to 13% when the home was added as a mediation variable. We also found that the effect of SES on motor development was moderated by age. For older children, the effect was lower than for younger children. The best model used SES as the predictor, HOME as the mediator, and AGE as the moderator variable and explained 17% of the variance in motor development. In summary, these findings suggest that, like previous reports with young children, the HOME environment and SES may play an important role in motor development of school‐age children. Our findings encourage the assessment of the home and interventions that take into account the home environment to improve motor development in school‐age children.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fcch.12606",""

Instead parents are influenced by their social networks, broadly defined as the people and sources they go to for information, direction, and advice. This study used social network analysis to formally examine parents’ social networks (people networks and source net-works) related to their vaccination decision-making. In addition to providing descriptions of typical networks of parents who conform to the recommended vaccination schedule (conformers) and those who do not (nonconformers), this study also quantified the effect of network variables on parents’ vaccination choices. METHODS: This study took place in King County, Washington. Participation was limited to US-born, first-time parents with children aged ≤18 months. Data were collected via an online survey. Logistic regression was used to analyze the resulting data. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-six conformers and 70 nonconformers completed the survey. Although people networks were reported by 95% of parents in both groups, nonconformers were significantly more likely to report source networks (100% vs 80%, P &lt; .001). Model comparisons of parent, people, and source network characteristics indicated that people network variables were better predictors of parents’ vaccination choices than parents’ own characteristics or the characteristics of their source networks. In fact, the variable most predictive of parents’ vaccination decisions was the percent of parents’ people networks recommending nonconformity. CONCLUSIONS: These results strongly suggest that social networks, and particularly parents’ people networks, play an important role in parents’ vaccination decision-making.","https://publications.aap.org/aapbooks/book/chapter-pdf/1514788/aap_9781610022774-the_impact.pdf",""

Caspase‐3 activation and function has been well defined during programmed cell death, but caspase activity, at low levels, is also required for cell development. We established a database, the CaspBase, for phylogenetic and ancestral reconstruction of caspases, which consists of >1,500 caspase genes. From this database, we resurrected ancestors of the caspase‐3, ‐6, ‐7 subfamily, and the common ancestor displays enzyme specificity similar to the initiator caspase subfamily from which it evolved. The specificities of the caspase‐3/‐7 and caspase‐6 enzymes evolved early, after the two lineages split. Structural studies of the ancestral enzymes identify changes in the active sites that result in changes in substrate selection. In contrast to enzyme activity, several allosteric sites evolved later in the lineages. We define interaction networks that facilitate the allosteric regulation in caspase‐3, and we show that, within a conserved loop, one site of phosphorylation evolved with the apoptotic caspases, while a second site is a more recent evolutionary event in mammalian caspase‐3. Localized changes in the loop propagate to the active site of the same protomer and disrupt substrate hydrolysis by facilitating transient ionic interactions with the catalytic histidine. In contrast, a cluster of hydrophobic amino acids in the dimer interface connects the conserved loop to the active site of the second protomer. The presence of the second modification in the conserved loop introduces a “kill switch” in mammalian caspase‐3. The data reveal how evolutionary changes in a conserved allosteric site result in both a common pathway for lowering activity during cell development as well as introducing a more recent cluster‐specific switch to abolish activity.","",""

We demonstrate that visual acuity is not different than spectacles with a commercially available, center-distance soft multifocal contact lens (MFCL) (Biofinity Multifocal “D”; +2.50 D add). PURPOSE: To determine the spherical over-refraction (SOR) necessary to obtain best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) when fitting myopic children with a center-distance soft MFCL. METHODS: Children (n = 294) aged 7 to 11 years with myopia (spherical component) of −0.75 to −5.00 diopters (D) (inclusive) and 1.00 D cylinder or less (corneal plane) were fitted bilaterally with +2.50 D add Biofinity “D” MFCLs. The initial MFCL power was the spherical equivalent of a standardized subjective refraction, rounded to the nearest 0.25 D step (corneal plane). An SOR was performed monocularly (each eye) to achieve BCVA. Binocular, high-contrast logMAR acuity was measured with manifest spectacle correction and MFCLs with over-refraction. Photopic pupil size was measured with a pupilometer. RESULTS: The mean (±SD) age was 10.3 ± 1.2 years, and the mean (±SD) SOR needed to achieve BCVA was OD: −0.61 ± 0.24 D/OS: −0.58 ± 0.27 D. There was no difference in binocular high-contrast visual acuity (logMAR) between spectacles (−0.01 ± 0.06) and best-corrected MFCLs (-0.01 ± 0.07) ( CONCLUSIONS: Children achieved BCVA with +2.50 D add MFCLs that was not different than with spectacles. Children typically required an over-refraction of −0.50 to −0.75 D to achieve BCVA. With a careful over-refraction, these +2.50 D add MFCLs provide good distance acuity, making them viable candidates for myopia control.","https://journals.lww.com/00006324-201804000-00003",""

Nevertheless, there is a long history of and literature on universities failing to implement their own sustainability initiatives. Apart from typical justifications for implementation failure that include budget constraints and financial infeasibility, one of the main obstacles that consistently keeps universities from achieving their own sustainability-related goals is a lack of enforcement. More precisely, universities tend to codify their sustainability-related goals in non-binding declarations that are voluntary. In that respect, failure to achieve a goal does not result in any sort of formal sanction. As such, universities are free to claim a commitment to sustainability in their public communications, without having to consistently and persistently demonstrate that commitment in practice. Situated on this backdrop, the present review paper aims to concisely and selectively stitch together three streams of literature: (1) the rationale for sustainability and, by extension, sustainable energy consumption, in higher education; (2) the current state of sustainability planning and its (in)efficacy in institutions of higher education; and (3) effective practices for reducing energy consumption at scales comparable to university campuses.","https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/9/3250/pdf",""

However, there is little understanding of how to create and maintain successful school–community collaboration. Drawing on a critical paradigm, this study developed a comprehensive framework for transformative school–community collaboration (TSCC) and developed a valid scale to assess the major dimensions of TSCC. Using school survey data, an exploratory factor analysis identified four multidimensional constructs: (a) critical member capacity representing members' organizing, interpersonal, and critical analysis skills, (b) equal relations with respect to joint membership, interaction, and outcome distribution, (c) democratic network governance measuring the basic elements of democracy in decision‐making, and (d) empowering coordination reflecting a responsive, flexible, and supportive coordination system. This study also showed that low‐income and urban schools reported significantly lower levels of equal relations and empowering coordination. The developed scale can be used as an evaluation tool that monitors and evaluates school–community collaboration ensuring equal, democratic, and empowering structures and processes. Furthermore, the results of this study suggest practice implications and future research agendas to create and maintain successful school–community collaboration.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fcfs.12608",""

The safety constraints are converted to the constraints on the tip position and velocity. To handle this constrained control problem, a barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is employed in the control design. The derivative of the logarithmic BLF is more complicated compared with the derivative of a quadratic Lyapunov function, which makes the problem of “explosion of terms” more serious. Thus, the dynamic surface control is used to deal with the problem. Furthermore, an extended state observer is adopted to estimate and compensate the uncertainty and disturbance in the system. The stability analysis via the singular perturbation theory shows the local practical exponential stability of the system. Simulation results indicate that the control performance is guaranteed without violation of the constraints.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/DSCC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/DSCC2018-9006/2377186/v003t42a001-dscc2018-9006.pdf",""

Using Latent Class Analysis, we examined the dynamic relationship between demographic characteristics, hazard exposure, and recovery priorities, with an emphasis on factors that influenced households to rebuild and remain in their original community.

I predicted that apes would be more active at night during periods of greater lunar illuminosity given diurnal primates’ lack of visual specializations for low‐light conditions and in dry season months when water scarcity exacerbated heat stress. Materials and Methods: I observed chimpanzees for 403 hrs on 40 nights between 2007 and 2013 and categorized their activity as social, movement, or vocalization. I scored their activity as occurring after moonrise or before moonset and considered the influence of moon phase (fuller versus darker phases) as well as season on chimpanzee nocturnal behavior in the analyses. Results: Results indicate that apes were more active after moonrise or before moonset during fuller moon phases in the dry season but not the wet season. Most night‐time activity involved movement (travel or forage), followed by social behavior, and long‐distance vocal communication. Discussion: Animals in highly seasonal habitats often exhibit thermoregulatory adaptations but, like other primates, chimpanzees lack physiological mechanisms to combat thermal stress. This study provides evidence that they may exhibit behaviors that allow them to avoid high temperatures in a savanna environment, such as feeding and socializing at night during the hottest time of year and in the brightest moon phases. The results support theories invoking thermal stress as a selective pressure for hominins in open environments where heat would constrain temporal foraging niches, and suggest an adaptability of sleeping patterns in response to external factors.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fajpa.23434",""

While malnutrition has long been suggested to be protective against malaria, recent studies have shown that malnourished children are more susceptible to malaria infections, with increased mortality rates. Current vaccination protocols result in immunity that decays, but the influence of malnutrition in the target population has not been explored. To better understand how malnutrition affects the development of protective T cells in this infection, we used a diet of moderate malnutrition to determine the activation of effector (Teff), central memory (Tcm) and effector memory (Tem) T cells. C57Bl/6 mice were fed on either protein sufficient (16%) or moderately malnourished diets (3% protein, and deficient in both Iron and Zinc) for 5 weeks. Upon infection, we observed a significant decrease in the number of effector cells at day 7 post-infection. This was accompanied by a significant drop in weight among the malnourished mice. Surprisingly, there was no significant deference in parasitemia by day 7p.i. At the memory timepoints (d60 p.i), we observed that the spleens of the malnourished mice were much smaller than the well-nourished control mice. There was a significant drop in the number of CD4 T cells and Tcm but the proportion of Tem increased in the malnourished mice and a lower cell number due to the few total CD4 T cells in the malnourished group. Our data indicate that the nutritional status of the host affect the pool of memory CD4 T cells generated in malaria infection. This could be one mechanism as to why T cell immunity decays in malaria patients as the disease is prevalent in resource-limited nations.","https://journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article/200/1_Supplement/52.39/60930/Malnutrition-Decreases-both-Effector-and-Memory",""

We have no evidence of any target taxa (i.e., tortoises, freshwater turtles, toads) breaching a conveyor belt barrier from projects in central Florida (2005–2012), Guadalupe County, Texas (2014–2018), or Robertson County, Texas (2014). The proposed technique is unlikely to prevent large‐bodied, saltatory, climbing, or arboreal taxa from crossing a wildlife barrier.

Our results revealed five key areas of opportunity for improving collaboration: recognizing the desire for cross-training; knowing who has authority when; nurturing the ‘serve’ component of school policing; gaining community support; and the need for strategic documentation. The present study serves a larger purpose, which is to inform the development of a strategic framework to guide school policing programme implementation.

We have previously documented improvements in endothelium‐dependent vasodilation but not arterial stiffness in healthy, middle‐aged adults with an 8‐week Bikram yoga intervention. Currently, it is unknown whether the effect of hot yoga on endothelial function might be attributed to the hatha yoga asanas or the high temperature/humidity. It is also unknown whether a longer intervention might produce significant alterations in arterial stiffness. PURPOSE: The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effects of a 12‐week Bikram yoga intervention performed in standard heated conditions and in a thermoneutral environment on endothelium‐dependent vasodilation and arterial stiffness. METHODS: Fifty‐two sedentary but apparently healthy adults aged 40–60 years were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Bikram yoga practiced at 40.5°C (n=19); Bikram yoga practiced at 23°C (n=14); or sedentary time‐control (n=19). The 12‐week yoga intervention consisted of 3 weekly 90‐minute Bikram yoga classes. The time control group was instructed to maintain current lifestyle patterns for the study duration. Body composition was determined via dual energy x‐ray absorptiometry (DXA). Endothelium‐dependent vasodilation was measured noninvasively using brachial artery flow‐mediated dilation (FMD) after 5 minutes of blood flow occlusion. Arterial stiffness was measured via brachial‐ankle pulse wave velocity (PWV). RESULTS: Age, anthropometric variables, plasma lipid, glucose, and triglyceride concentrations, brachial artery FMD and brachial‐ankle PWV were not different among the three groups at baseline. Body fat percentage declined (p<0.01) and total‐ (p=0.051) and LDL‐cholesterol (p =0.09) concentrations tended to decline only in the hot (40.5°C) yoga group. Brachial artery FMD increased (P<0.05) in both yoga groups but brachial‐ankle PWV was not significantly altered in any group. There were no changes in any outcome variables in the time control group. CONCLUSIONS: Bikram yoga practiced in hot/humid and thermoneutral conditions produced similar improvements in endothelium‐dependent vasodilation in healthy, middle‐aged adults. The addition of the heat led to reductions in body fat percentage. Bikram yoga does not appear to modulate arterial stiffness in middle‐aged adults.","",""

The NBQA-2016 was conducted from March through December of 2016, and assessed hide-on carcasses (n = 5,278), chilled carcasses (n = 4,285), heads (n = 5,720), and offal items (n = 4,800) in 18 commercial processing facilities throughout the United States. Beef cattle were predominantly black-hided; 68.0% of beef cows and 67.2% of beef bulls possessed a black hide. Holstein was the predominant type of dairy animal observed. Just over half (56.0%) of the cattle surveyed had no mud contamination on the hide, and when mud was present, 34.1% of cattle only had small amounts. Harvest floor assessments found 44.6% of livers, 23.1% of lungs, 22.3% of hearts, 20.0% of viscera, 8.2% of heads, and 5.9% of tongues were condemned. Liver condemnations were most frequently due to abscess presence. In contrast, contamination was the primary reason for condemnation of all other offal items. Of the cow carcasses surveyed, 17.4% carried a fetus at the time of harvest. As expected, mean carcass weight and loin muscle area values observed for bulls were heavier and larger than cows. The marbling scores represented by cull animal carcasses were most frequently slight and traces amounts. Cow carcasses manifested a greater amount of marbling on average than bull carcasses. The predominant fat color score showed all carcasses surveyed had some level of yellow fat. Only 1.3% of carcasses exhibited signs of arthritic joints. Results of the NBQA-2016 indicate there are areas in which the beef and dairy industries have improved and areas that still need attention to prevent value loss in market cows and bulls.","http://academic.oup.com/tas/article-pdf/2/1/37/33234149/txx002.pdf",""

In this qualitative study, we focus on perceptions on Hepatitis C within a rural community, describe how the local residents perceive social hierarchy within their community, and explore the process of stigma building. Informed by a grounded theory approach, we employed a snowball sampling strategy in a southern rural area to conduct in-depth, open-ended interviews. In our findings we describe how local restaurants were often utilized as places to exchange personal opinions on various community issues among the upper hierarchical members, consider the ways social hierarchy influences people’s perceptions, and explore community members’ response to the problem of ignored viral infections within the community. We found the community leaders are earning the trust by living in the community for an extended period of time; therefore, they tend to be elderly yet remain active as members of various committees. Additionally, we argue that the common view of “family-like support” in rural communities is largely a myth; it is a romanticized view of the rural living held and perpetuated by the upper-class people in the community. Therefore, instead of depending on idealized or imaginary social support, rural communities need to consider organizing a system of formal support.","",""

A number of frameworks are utilized to help auditors address the trade‐offs between efficiency and cost while having valid overpayment amount estimates. As a potential improvement, this paper presents a novel information‐theoretic multistage sampling framework. In particular, we propose an iterative stratified sampling method that uses Lindley's entropy measure to evaluate the expected amount of information. We use US Medicare Part B claims outpatient payment data and investigate the versatility of the framework for different overpayment scenarios and resource allocation designs. The proposed method results in reasonable coverage and lower estimation errors for the proportion of overpaid claims and overpayment recovery amounts. Our sampling method is shown to outperform the current stratification method of practice, ie, Neyman allocation, for many scenarios. The framework also can be used to make probability statements on variables of interest, such as the number of overpaid claims.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fasmb.2338",""

Background: Sexual satisfaction is key to marital quality, yet marital sex typically diminishes in midlife. Little is known, however, about how married straight and lesbian women make sense of midlife sexuality. Comparing the narratives of lesbian and straight women can reveal how midlife events, relational contexts, and gender norms drive women's experiences of and responses to diminishing sex. Method: Inductive and deductive analyses were performed on interviews with a convenience sample of 16 straight and 16 lesbian mostly high‐status married couples in Massachusetts. Results: Lesbian and straight women suggest that sexual activity and desire diminish over time due to health, aging, and caregiving events, yet lesbian women additionally emphasize the importance of weight gain, caregiving for adult parents, and shared experiences of menopause. Women further describe distress when their sex lives diverge from norms specific to marriage and their sexual identities. Moreover, women report relationship work designed to maintain or reignite sex; when compared with straight women, lesbians describe more work and a stronger sense of duty to keep sex alive and uniquely describe medical providers as unhelpful in addressing sexual challenges. Conclusion: The results suggest that relational contexts and cultural discourses shape straight and lesbian women's experiences of distress and comfort about diminishing sex in marriage.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fjomf.12508",""

This path is somewhat analogous to that of the Lamb wave observed on metallic shells. Rubber is a unique material because of its subsonic sound speed relative to water, and because shear coupling is often small enough to be neglected in typical models, making it fluid-like. This makes rubber a material of interest for coating and cloaking underwater devices and vehicles. Both fluid and elastic rubber partial wave series models are tested, using experimentally measured longitudinal and shear speeds, attenuation, and rubber density. A finite element model for the shell is also developed. Comparison of the models and experiments highlights the importance of the waveguide path to the overall scattering. Estimates for the group and phase velocities of the lowest order propagating mode in the shell are determined through waveguide normal mode analysis and Sommerfeld−Watson theory, and are shown to give good agreement with experiments in predicting the time of arrival of the waveguide path.","http://asa.scitation.org/doi/am-pdf/10.1121/1.5038256",""

Utilizing infectious clone-derived viruses, we show that genetic diversity of RNA viruses is complex and that multiple genes, including structural genes and NS2B and NS4B genes also contribute to genetic diversity.

Forty‐seven independent events were identified after event sampling from more than 345 hr of observations of four mother‐calf pairs and their companions. Unique aspects of this behavior included early emergence presumably without the benefit of a model and a preference for similar aged partners. Adult belugas did not display this social interaction. Based on its early emergence, the presence of similar‐aged partner preferences, and affiliative cooperative contexts, this unusual mouth‐to‐mouth social interaction may play a significant role in beluga social and physical development. To evaluate this possibility, additional research is needed in which the complete topography, possible functions, and potential outcomes associated with this rare but conspicuous behavior exhibited by beluga calves are assessed.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fzoo.21463",""

Pathogens may be transferred from the GI tract to external carcass surfaces during normal harvest procedures but can be mitigated by antimicrobial carcass interventions. Lymph nodes (LNs) are typically encased in fat and are protected from antimicrobial carcass surface treatments, thus serving as a possible root cause of foodborne illnesses attributed to Salmonella in meat products. Members of the pork industry are committed to food safety and want to better understand Salmonella as a potential contaminant in pork products. To establish a baseline of Salmonella prevalence in porcine LNs across the United States, 21 commercial pork harvest facilities, representing northern (n = 12) or southern (n = 9) geographical regions, participated in this study. As processing volumes allowed, 25 carcasses were selected from each establishment. From each carcass, left and right superficial inguinal LNs (n =1,014 LNs) were removed and pooled to yield one sample per animal or n = 507 total LN samples. Salmonella prevalence rates differed (P &lt; 0.05) between hog types in both regions. Specifically, 6.4% of market hog and 37.0% of sow samples were Salmonella positive in the northern region. This was reversed in the southern region as 13.0% of market hog and 4.8% of sow samples were Salmonella positive. There also was a difference (P &lt; 0.05) in prevalence rates between northern and southern regions for sows, but not market hogs (P &gt; 0.05). Type of chilling method (conventional, blast, or other) used at each market hog facility (n = 12) was documented. In the northern region, prevalence rates of Salmonella across chilling types were as follows: 20.0%, 2.7%, and 1.3% positive samples for conventional, other, and blast chill methods, respectively. In the southern region, 20.0% of samples were positive for conventional, 0.0% for blast, and 12.0% for other chilling methods. In both regions, samples from conventionally chilled carcasses returned more (P &lt; 0.05) positive results than any other chill method. Overall, the higher rate of Salmonella prevalence in northern sows warrants further investigation, and members of the pork industry would benefit from the identification of possible methods to address the presence of Salmonella in porcine LNs.","http://academic.oup.com/tas/article-pdf/2/4/365/33233500/txy072.pdf",""

Honey bees are excellent models for learning and other complex behaviors; furthermore, they share many behavioral responses to ethanol (EtOH) with humans and animal models. We develop a 2‐feeder choice assay to determine whether honey bees will self‐administer and preferentially consume solutions containing EtOH. Methods: Gustatory responsiveness to EtOH is determined using the proboscis extension reflex and consumption assays. A 2‐feeder choice assay is used to examine preference for the consumption of EtOH. Survival assays assess the metabolic and toxic effects of EtOH consumption. Results: Honey bees find the taste of EtOH to be aversive when in water, but addition of sucrose masks the aversive taste. Even though the taste of EtOH is not appetitive, honey bees preferentially consume sucrose solutions containing 1.25 to 2.5% EtOH in a dose‐dependent manner. Based on survival assays, honey bees may not be able to derive caloric value from EtOH, and EtOH concentrations of 2.5% or higher lead to significant increases in mortality. Conclusions: Honey bees will self‐administer EtOH and show a preference for consuming solutions containing EtOH. Bees may not be able to efficiently utilize EtOH as an energy source, but EtOH‐dependent increases in mortality complicate separating the effects of caloric value and toxicity.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Facer.13908",""

Advanced liver fibrosis results in cirrhosis, liver failure, and portal hypertension and may even require liver transplantation. A liver biopsy is considered the “gold standard” method for the assessment of liver fibrosis; however, ultrasonography can also detect changes in the hepatic parenchyma due to fibrosis. Although reports in the literature describe phenytoin-induced hepatic injury, often this rare occurrence is usually accompanied by a hypersensitivity reaction. Case report:: Our patient is a 50-year-old female with history of schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, who had been admitted to a state psychiatric facility. She has a history of seizure disorder, which had been well controlled with phenytoin since 2011. Mild-to-moderate elevations in her liver enzymes were noted during therapy but normalized once phenytoin was discontinued. An ultrasound of the patient's liver in January 2016 showed changes of fatty infiltration and fibrosis. Conclusion:: This case differs from other cases reported in the literature that describe phenytoin-induced hepatic injury. The majority of these cases are accompanied by immune-allergic features.

We explore the deposition of Eu metal on SrTiO3/Si pseudo-substrates, with varying SrTiO3 (STO) thickness, under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. By varying the thickness of the STO layer (2-10 nm) and the deposition temperature (20-300 °C), we investigate the process by which oxygen is scavenged from STO by Eu. In situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is used to investigate the electronic structure of the nominal Eu/STO/Si stack. We find that as a result of Eu deposition, epitaxial EuO is formed on thick STO (6-10 nm), leaving behind a highly oxygen-deficient SrTiO3-δ layer of ∼4 nm in thickness. However, if the thickness of the STO layer is comparable to or less than the scavenging depth, the crystal structure of STO is disrupted and a solid state reaction between Eu, Si, and STO occurs when the deposition is done at a high temperature (300 °C). On the other hand, at a low temperature (20 °C), only a 1-2 nm-thick EuO interlayer is grown, on top of which the Eu metal appears to be stable. This study elucidates the growth process under different conditions and provides a better understanding and control of this system.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.5059560/13482936/235301_1_online.pdf",""

This study examines the role of external (coercive pressure) and internal (top management involvement) factors that potentially explain SCS practice deployment and its effect on SCS performance. It also examines the moderating role of organizational culture. In essence, this inquiry examines the role of external and internal forces in a context where organizational action is perhaps effectively mobilized only when both external and internal pressures are salient. Using data from 166 U.S. manufacturing firms, we found that the effects of coercive forces on SCS practice deployment are transmitted via top management involvement. In addition, the effect of top management involvement on SCS practice deployment is more salient for firms with high security‐oriented organizational culture, although a diminishing return was detected. SCS practice deployment was found to be strongly related to SCS performance. We discuss the theoretical contributions and managerial implications based on our findings.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fdeci.12336",""

The concept of anti-racist leadership is explored to better understand how principal preparation programs can better prepare aspiring leaders to address how race, power, and individual, institutional, and cultural racism impact beliefs, structures, and outcomes for students of color. This preparation is accomplished by examining how a principal preparation program, adopting an anti-racist curriculum, further develops the racial consciousness of its predominantly White student cohort. The anti-racist curriculum made the impact of race more salient to students and had an impact on their leadership beliefs, decisions, and actions once they served in school leadership positions.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/016146811812001409",""

However, two counterintuitive features we identified obscure any mechanism for the predominance of Tem in chronic infection: that Tem differentiation begins very early in infection, and that Tem do not require persistent infection to survive. Within the first five days of Plasmodium chabaudi infection, the relative proportions of MPEC to SLEC (CD127− CD62Llo) are determined, and predict the ratio of Tcm to Tem. Furthermore, Tem survive as well as Tcm, and better than SLEC, in uninfected recipients. In addition, we determined that Tem are derived from the same memory precursor effector T cells (MPEC, CD127− CD62Lhi) as central memory T cells (Tcm). We have now identified three mechanisms promoting Tem numbers in chronic infection: 1) Tcm can be programmed by chronic infection to produce Tem, even after infection is over low-level, 2) persistent infection promotes turnover of Tem, and 3) some SLEC can also survive to generate Tem. These findings support the feasibility of generating protective Tem by vaccination. Another caveat to generating protection to chronic infection by vaccination, is that protection from disease can be improved by ongoing infection, suggesting a role for SLEC. Therefore, we tested both SLEC and Tmem subsets for contributions to protection, and found that SLEC protect best. Also, decay of SLEC coincides with declining protection as chronic infection is cleared. Nevertheless, one subset of Tem (CD127hiCD62LloCD27−) reduces parasitemia and pathology, and maintains Ifng expression in chronic infection. These findings provide important insight into mechanisms of development and maintenance of immunity to chronic infection.","https://journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article/200/1_Supplement/52.15/60952/Mechanisms-of-maintenance-of-protection-from",""

This essay calls for more monograph‐length studies on the shared history of the early Haitian and American republics. The embrace of the rich historical literature by Haitian scholars, along with expanding research opportunities and analytical methods, can equip scholars based in North America to publish more books that illuminate the inextricable significance of Haiti's history, beyond its revolution, to the development of early American life and politics.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fhic3.12442",""

Speculations have been made about these spaces creating a community of practice, improving retention, improving design skills and self-efficacy, teaching manufacturing skills, improving creativity, and providing many other benefits, but this has not been empirically documented. This paper compares student engineering design self-efficacy (i.e., confidence, motivation, expectation of success, and anxiety toward conducting engineering design) to reported usage rates from a makerspace at a large Hispanic-serving university in the Southwestern United States. Not all users of these spaces were engineering students, and as such, responses were examined through the context of student major as well as differences in gender, race/ethnicity, or first-generation college student status. Design self-efficacy is critical because when individuals have high self-efficacy for particular skills they tend to seek more opportunities to apply those skills, and show more perseverance in the face of set-backs. Thus, self-efficacy is often a good predictor of achievement. The results from one year of data at the Hispanic-serving university indicate that female and first-generation college students have significantly lower engineering design self-efficacy scores. The data also shows that being a user of the makerspace correlates to a higher confidence, motivation, and expectation of success toward engineering design. Initial data from two additional schools are also consistent with these same results. These results indicate that, for all students, regardless of race/ethnicity and/or first generation status, being a frequent user of a university-serving makerspace likely positively impacts confidence, motivation, and expectation of success toward engineering design.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/DETC2018-86311/2476077/v003t04a010-detc2018-86311.pdf",""

The LWMB was established by a kinesiology professor who started working with kinesiology students whose focus is in allied health to provide services to individuals who have spinal cord injuries or other neurological disabilities. Using a team approach, the LWMB, under the kinesiology professor’s supervision, works closely with the patrons and their families, and the graduate assistants and interns from the Kinesiology Department of the university. Even though relatively unknown to the general public, the Laboratory has been successful in helping the patrons and training the students.  Nevertheless, in order to remain sustainable and to continuously “provide access to the benefits of exercise to those who otherwise are disregarded” (Priest, 2016), a comprehensive marketing business model is needed to help the LWMB warrant its “success and future expansion”. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the current marketing business model of the LWMB and then provide recommendations to improve it. A theoretical framework that shows potential outcomes of the improved marketing business model for the stroke survivors and interns is also presented. The results of the market analysis show that this laboratory operates in a very competitive and technologically turbulent business environment with many opportunities and threats. Several recommendations are made for LWMB to improve its marketing business model to deal with the challenges of its internal and external operating environments.","",""

Louis Hartz finds in early American settlement a sort of instinctive Lockeanism, while Frederick Jackson Turner sees in the frontier the primary determining factor in American development. Combining the two suggests that American society may well have developed along Lockean lines, but only if the frontier was in fact at least an approximation of Locke’s state of nature. The frontier does resemble such a state in certain respects, though Locke’s concepts of natural law and justice are conspicuously absent, or at least very weak. This helps to explain why the Americanized version of Locke described by Hartz, rather than a more accurate and complete reading, became the dominant ideological force in early American political development.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0043820018776408",""

Here we describe a previously uncharacterized protein, Ync13, and its roles during fission yeast cytokinesis. Ync13 is a member of the UNC-13/Munc13 protein family, whose animal homologues are essential priming factors for soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor complex assembly during exocytosis in various cell types, but no roles in cytokinesis have been reported. We find that Ync13 binds to lipids in vitro and dynamically localizes to the plasma membrane at cell tips during interphase and at the division site during cytokinesis. Deletion of Ync13 leads to defective septation and exocytosis, uneven distribution of cell-wall enzymes and components of cell-wall integrity pathway along the division site and massive cell lysis during cell separation. Interestingly, loss of Ync13 compromises endocytic site selection at the division plane. Collectively, we find that Ync13 has a novel function as an UNC-13/Munc13 protein in coordinating exocytosis, endocytosis, and cell-wall integrity during fission yeast cytokinesis.","",""

The smartwatch is paired with a smartphone that runs the SmartFall application, which performs the computation necessary for the prediction of falls in real time without incurring latency in communicating with a cloud server, while also preserving data privacy. We experimented with both traditional (Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes) and non-traditional (Deep Learning) machine learning algorithms for the creation of fall detection models using three different fall datasets (Smartwatch, Notch, Farseeing). Our results show that a Deep Learning model for fall detection generally outperforms more traditional models across the three datasets. This is attributed to the Deep Learning model’s ability to automatically learn subtle features from the raw accelerometer data that are not available to Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine, which are restricted to learning from a small set of extracted features manually specified. Furthermore, the Deep Learning model exhibits a better ability to generalize to new users when predicting falls, an important quality of any model that is to be successful in the real world. We also present a three-layer open IoT system architecture used in SmartFall, which can be easily adapted for the collection and analysis of other sensor data modalities (e.g., heart rate, skin temperature, walking patterns) that enables remote monitoring of a subject’s wellbeing.","https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/18/10/3363/pdf",""

These computer‐based technologies, if well‐utilized in support of learning, can promote personalized and collaborative education, which research suggests are valuable pedagogies. However, new technologies create a burden on designers and educators to use them effectively in support of learning and instruction. Emphasis on 21st century skills suggests that education should emphasize the development of critical thinking and complex problem‐solving skills. Meanwhile, many educators encounter students who lack motivation and are ill‐prepared in reading and mathematics. In addition, engineering educators face another challenge—namely, the need to frequently update curricula so that students can attain marketable skills and adapt to rapidly changing technologies in the workplace. As it happens, proper use of educational technologies can provide solutions to these challenges. This paper reports one such approach to integrate new technologies in two hybrid synchronous courses using technology‐enabled scaffolds in support of deep learning and enhanced problem‐solving competence in engineering education at small colleges in the United States.

Fishes were surveyed over a 19-year period at three sites along the longitudinal gradient: a headwater site with a narrow channel, a middle site with shallow channels traversing a seasonal wetland, and a lower site where the channel has higher banks. Assemblage composition and presence of species with juveniles and various life history strategies were compared during wet and dry seasons. Overall, fish species richness was lowest at the headwater site and highest at the downstream site. During the wet season, however, species richness is greatest at the middle site, a pattern associated with migration into the site for reproduction and use of the wetland as a nursery. During the dry season, species richness is greater at the downstream site where habitat quality is sufficient to provide suitable habitat for many species. Fish movements and population dynamics in Caño Maraca respond to seasonal environmental changes, and the fish metacommunity appears influenced by species sorting (habitat selection), mass effects (source-sink dynamics), patch dynamics (interspecific differences in colonization and species interaction) as well as random factors (dry-season strandings).","http://www.scielo.br/pdf/ni/v16n4/1982-0224-ni-16-04-e180074.pdf",""

Thin shale layers isolating productive intervals in a reservoir have important implications for reservoir development and EOR strategies. In addition, weaknesses in caprocks overlying injection intervals may adversely affect the safety of fluid injection approaches including gas storage, waste water disposal, and CO2 geological storage. Even low permeability of a caprock overlying the injection zone can be very important by allowing for pressure dissipation out of the reservoir. In this work, we apply harmonic pressure testing method to characterize a caprock overlying a given injection zone. The diffusivity equations are written and solved in frequency domain for system of injection layer and above zone with the low permeability caprock in between. A vertical well is perforated in the middle of the injection layer. A periodic flow rate pulse is disseminated from the injection well. The pressure pulses traveled through the caprock are observed in the above zone. The hydraulic characteristics of the low permeability caprock are estimated applying the analytical solution based on the above zone pressure amplitude. The caprock diffusivity is found to be in acceptable agreement with the true value. It is shown that the harmonic pulse testing is useful to characterize the intra/inter reservoir low permeability layers (caprocks).","http://onepetro.org/SPEATCE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/191524-MS/1214985/spe-191524-ms.pdf",""

Although these observations are often beneficial for brands, this research demonstrates that observing luxury brand consumers whose consumption arose from unearned (vs. earned) financial resources reduces observers’ brand attitudes when observers place a high value on fairness. When fairness values are high, observers do not perceive luxury brand consumers who use unearned (vs. earned) consumption resources as prestigious, and in turn, lower prestige perceptions adversely affect observers’ brand evaluations for luxury brands. Consistent with our theorizing regarding the signaling of prestige, the joint effect of consumers’ consumption resources and observers’ fairness values on observers’ brand attitudes does not hold for nonluxury brands, which are not associated with prestige and thereby are not denigrated when the consumer is not perceived as prestigious. This research sheds light on the role of moral values in marketplace judgments of luxury consumption and brand attitude by considering the influence of consumption resources on observers’ judgments.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fjcpy.1028",""

Salinity coupled with freshwater scarcity has forced many farmers in arid regions to abandon agricultural lands. This study evaluated irrigation potential of marginal quality treated urban wastewater to produce bioenergy sorghum on saline soils collected from an abandoned degraded salt affected lands in Texas and New Mexico under greenhouse conditions. Study results indicated that the energy sorghum biomass production and quality under wastewater irrigation were comparable to that irrigated with freshwater on nonsaline soils. Soil salinity especially in the subsurface increased over time under wastewater irrigation compared to that under freshwater irrigation. Soil sodicity (measured by sodium adsorption ratios) increased over time in all water–soil treatment combinations. Sodicity values were higher in treatments that received wastewater irrigation with no addition of calcium to counter sodium. Although sodicity exceeded the threshold value, no impairment in soil permeability was observed. Study results indicated a great potential for marginal quality water irrigation to improve degraded saline land productivity. Further field studies are required to confirm our greenhouse study results and the potential of bioenergy crops especially on saline soils and to highlight treated wastewater as a potential irrigation source.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fldr.2883",""

Thus, vendors could be a critical factor in the health IT adoption, but nursing home management must critically evaluate not only the services, but also the strategic partnerships offered by the vendors.

We previously have shown that mice given an experimental pulmonary infection with a genetically modified strain of H99 that produces murine IFN-γ, H99γ, are able to completely resolve the pulmonary infection via the upregulation of the IFN-γ/STAT1 signaling pathway. Activation of STAT1 signaling leads to the production of CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 chemokines. These chemokines each serve as ligands for the CXCR3 receptor that is present on host immune cells including T cells, NK cells, dendritic cells (DCs) and plasmacytoid DCs and facilitate their chemotaxis to the site of infection. C57BL/6 (B6) mice produce a non-functional CXCL11 protein. Our studies show that B6 mice infected with C. neoformans strain H99γ have a 40% survival, compared to 100% survival in BALB/c mice and an 80% survival of F1 generation mice (first generation of BALB/c × B6) at day 60-post inoculation. After 60 days post-inoculation F1 mice infected with H99γ had a significant decrease in fungal burden compared to B6 mice. We also demonstrated that B6 mice do not produce CXCL11, as expected, at day 7 and 14 post-inoculation whereas F1 mice show a significant increase in the production of CXCL11 compared to B6 mice. Lastly, treatment of B6 mice given a pulmonary C. neoformans infection with recombinant CXCL11 resulted in a significant decrease in pulmonary fungal burden compared to untreated B6 mice infected with C. neoformans. These data suggest that activation of the STAT1-mediated signaling pathway and CXCL11 chemokine production is necessary for optimal protection against pulmonary C. neoformans infection.","https://journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article/200/1_Supplement/52.31/60942/Requirement-of-CXCL11-chemokine-production-for",""

Unlike traditional Lagrangian approaches to cloth simulation, our EOL approach permits bending exactly at and sliding over sharp edges, avoiding parasitic locking caused by over-constraining contact constraints. Wherever the cloth is in contact with sharp features, we insert EOL vertices into the cloth, while the rest of the cloth is simulated in the standard Lagrangian fashion. Our algorithm manifests as new equations of motion for EOL vertices, a contact-conforming remesher, and a set of simple constraint assignment rules, all of which can be incorporated into existing state-of-the-art cloth simulators to enable smooth, inequality-constrained contact between cloth and objects in the world.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3197517.3201281",""

No/NOS system plays an important role in the process of inflammation. Balance between nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide is critical in inflammatory process. Peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) has been implicated in pathology of diseases involving inflammation and in our previous studies we reported reduction in PPARγ protein expression and activity in animals exposed to acrolein. Since PPARγ influences both NO and superoxide generation, in this study we are proposing involvement of impairment of this regulation in acrolein‐mediated inflammatory response. Male iNOS knockout (inducible nitric oxide synthase, KO) mice were treated with acrolein (0.5 μg/kg; i.p.; 7 days) with/without rosiglitazone (Roz: PPARγ ligand, 10 mg/kg; orally; 10 days). Age/weight matched wild type (WT) were used as control. Urine and kidney tissue was processed for western blot and biochemical analysis. KO mice had higher (87%) 8‐Isoprostane in response to acrolein but lower NO (23%) compared to WT. Roz reduced 8‐isoprostane in KO mice by 47% and increased NO production by 35%. Total Antioxidant Status (TAS) was reduced in WT (31%) and KO (53%) mice treated with acrolein. Roz improved TAS in both KO (33%) and WT (21%) mice. Acrolein did not affect expression of eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase) in WT and KO mice. Roz increased eNOS expression in WT (23%) and KO (33%) and iNOS expression in WT (28%). Expression of PPARγ was increased in WT (30%) and KO (28%) mice treated with acrolein and was further increased with addition of Roz (89% & 102% respectively). Based on these data, we are concluding that acrolein‐mediated reduction in PPARγ affects eNOS/iNOS/NO pathway and activation of PPARγ minimizes acrolein effect by improving PPARγ‐dependent NO/NOS interaction.","",""

However, the effects of NMES on muscle growth are not clear and no human studies have compared anabolic signaling between low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) NMES. The purpose of this study was to determine the skeletal muscle anabolic signaling response to an acute bout of LF- and HF-NMES. Methods: Eleven young healthy volunteers (6 men, 5 women) received an acute bout of LF-NMES (20 Hz) and HF-NMES (60 Hz). Muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle before the first NMES treatment and 30 min after each NMES treatment. Phosphorylation of the following key anabolic signaling proteins was measured by Western blot, and proteins are expressed as a ratio of phosphorylated to total: mammalian target of rapamycin, p70-S6 kinase 1, and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 1. Results: Compared with pre-NMES, phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin was upregulated 40.2% for LF-NMES ( Conclusions: An acute bout of LF- and HF-NMES upregulated anabolic signaling with HF-NMES producing a greater anabolic response compared with LF-NMES, suggesting that HF stimulation may provide a stronger stimulus for processes that initiate muscle hypertrophy.

With the recent explosion of interest in the Anthropocene, Sherlock’s book has been “rediscovered” and is being frequently cited in the Anthropocene literature.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0309133318787999",""

Additionally, strip loins (n = 6) from Honduran grass-finished (HGRASS) cattle and grain-finished (HGRAIN) cattle (n = 6) were collected from a commercial abattoir in Siguatepeque, Honduras and aged 21 d. Samples were evaluated on 8-point hedonic scales for flavor, tenderness, juiciness, and overall liking by 240 consumers in each country. Consumers indicated if each trait was acceptable, and willingness to pay for each sample was rated in U.S. dollars (or the Honduran Lempiras equivalent): $0, 3, 6, and 10 per 0.45 kg. Chemical composition and Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF) were also determined. The TC had greater (P < 0.05) fat percentage than SEL and HGRASS, but did not differ (P > 0.05) from HGRAIN. The HGRAIN had greater WBSF values than TC and SEL, which did not differ (P > 0.05); however, HGRASS was similar (P > 0.05) to all other treatments. The TC had greater tenderness and flavor liking scores (P < 0.05) than all other treatments, followed by SEL, HGRASS, and HGRAIN, with a significant difference between each treatment. Honduran consumers assigned greater ratings for tenderness and flavor liking when compared to U.S. consumers. The lowest rated treatment in both countries was Honduran grain-finished followed by Honduran grass-finished.

Our previous work on ghettoization in Budapest and on the spatio‐temporal patterns of Jewish persecution in Italy had a marked spatial dimension, both in the research questions we set out to answer and the methods we used, which were largely quantitative. During the course of our research, we progressively came to realize that a spatial perspective favors the voice of the perpetrator and that to fully comprehend and understand the geography of the Holocaust, we needed to engage with the voice of the victim, extend the set of methods and tools used, and broaden our epistemology. While proposing a fully‐fledged model of a qualitative GIS of the places and spaces of the Holocaust is beyond the scope of this article, we: (a) argue for the integration of social network analysis, corpus linguistics, and spatio‐temporal methods and for a mixed‐methods analytical approach and (b) note how the topological and relational foundations we identify as fundamental to a GIS of place parallel the long‐standing call for an “integrated history” of the Holocaust.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Ftgis.12342",""

Land surface temperature (LST) was calculated from Landsat 8 imagery for 20 July 2015 for the metropolitan areas of Austin and San Antonio, Texas. We sought to examine SUHI by relating LST to Lidar-derived terrain factors, land cover composition, and landscape pattern metrics developed using the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2011. The results indicate that (1) land cover composition is closely related to the SUHI effect for both metropolitan areas, as indicated by the global regression coefficients of building fraction and NDVI, with values of 0.29 and −0.74 for Austin, and 0.19 and −0.38 for San Antonio, respectively. The terrain morphology was also an indicator of the SUHI phenomenon, implied by the elevation (0.20 for Austin and 0.09 for San Antonio) and northness (0.20 for Austin and 0.09 for San Antonio); (2) the SUHI phenomenon of Austin on 20 July 2015 was affected by the spatial pattern of the land use and land cover (LULC), which was not detected for San Antonio; and (3) with a local determination coefficient higher than 0.8, GWR had higher explanatory power of the underlying factors compared to global regression. By accommodating spatial non-stationarity and allowing the model parameters to vary in space, GWR illustrated the spatial heterogeneity of the relationships between different land surface properties and the LST. The GWR analysis of SUHI phenomenon can provide unique information for site-specific land planning and policy implementation for SUHI mitigation.","https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/10/9/1428/pdf",""

Blend films with 25 vol. % Teflon decrease the drive voltage of single layer hole-only devices by more than 30% and dramatically increase their operating temperature limit to over 250 °C. The stability improvement appears to result from a nanoscale network of Teflon chains that repolymerize throughout the blend film following evaporation and inhibit gross movement of the organic semiconductor molecules. These results open up a pathway to stabilize the morphology of small molecule organic semiconductors and point to a more general opportunity to exploit semiconductor dilution to systematically vary thermal, optical, and other material properties without compromising electrical transport.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.5053923/14521713/263302_1_online.pdf",""

Because the two parties often have conflicting pecuniary incentives, customer trust and supplier trustworthiness play important roles in the success of these interactions. We investigate whether and how the process through which assistance is provided can foster trust and trustworthiness, and thus facilitate better cooperation. We compare three prevalent assistance processes: information sharing, advice provision, and delegation. We propose that, even if the pecuniary incentives of both parties do not vary from one assistance process to another, the assistance process itself impacts the customer’s and supplier’s nonpecuniary motives that give rise to trust and trustworthiness. Consequently, the assistance process affects the level of cooperation and payoffs. We test our behavioral predictions through laboratory experiments based on a retail distribution setting. We quantify the impact of different assistance processes on trust, trustworthiness and channel performance, and identify the underlying drivers of those impacts. Our results offer insight into the role of the assistance process in managing supplier assistance effectively and why certain assistance processes may lead to more successful outcomes than others even if the pecuniary incentives remain unaltered.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2617",""

In this study, experiments were conducted to examine the effect of process parameters and dynamic impedance for prediction of the size of denatured tissue zone during welding. A weld lobe that defines suitable process conditions was constructed. It is found that tissue denaturation starts from the center of the heated region. Dynamic impedance is strongly affected by the compression level and heating power. The size of denatured tissue zone can be predicted with the heating energy; however, the prediction is strongly dependent on the compression level.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/MSEC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/MSEC2018-6702/2520152/v001t05a011-msec2018-6702.pdf",""

Professional guidelines indicate that counseling is within the scope of practice for audiologists, yet research has shown that audiologists feel unprepared and are not comfortable providing adjustment counseling. This may be due to inadequate counseling training in audiology graduate programs. To identify ways to address this counseling training gap, this study examined the use of performance feedback to increase counseling skills among audiology graduate students. In this study, participants (n = 5) were recorded during clinical session encounters, and recordings were coded for time spent counseling. A licensed clinical psychologist reviewed the recordings and provided individual performance feedback to participants over the course of the study. Time spent counseling increased by the end of the study, although improvement varied across participants. Results suggest that performance feedback can be used as a method to increase counseling skills in audiology students. However, factors, such as participant motivation, feedback timing, and prerequisite counseling skills, may influence response to feedback. More research is needed on ways to maximize gains from feedback, as well as other methods to improve counseling skills in audiology students.","http://www.thieme-connect.de/products/ejournals/pdf/10.1055/s-0037-1613704.pdf",""

In order to explain this discrepancy between conscious beliefs and behavior, scholars have turned their attention to unconscious racial prejudice. One approach that is gaining wide acceptance is the Implicit Bias Model, which appeals to distinct implicit and explicit cognitive processes, coupled with an account of the ways in which people unconsciously internalize widespread stereotypes and stigmas. This article claims that although the Implicit Bias Model is in many respects useful, it leaves out a central aspect of unconscious racial prejudice: the underlying motivations and incentives for harboring racist attitudes and beliefs, which generate psychological resistances to knowing about or changing prejudices. A more complete account of unconscious racial prejudice can be developed by turning to theories of active ignorance, which contribute to what this article calls the Resistance Model.","https://scholarlypublishingcollective.org/psup/cpr/article-pdf/6/2/262/1274593/critphilrace_6_2_262.pdf",""

This study aims to advance a systematic understanding of the role of CSC in product longevity by developing a measurement scale through qualitative interviews, expert review, a survey to purify the scale, and a survey to validate a scale. The project began with 23 interviews among men and women who self‐identified as style confident, which aided in the development of 108 initial items. These items were reviewed by seven experts, resulting in the retention of 77 items. An online survey via a mass e‐mail facilitated through a large southwestern university's communication office yielded 141 responses for the purpose of scale purification, resulting in 26 items for the validation phase. An online survey was then conducted with a consumer panel purchased via Research Reward, yielding 451 usable surveys for scale validation. A measure of CSC that is both reliable and valid resulted, including 22 scale items across five distinct dimensions: style longevity, aesthetic perceptual ability, creativity, appearance importance, and authenticity. Analyses reveal a significant relationship between CSC and wardrobe engagement as well as wardrobe preservation, indicating that CSC is related to a more attentive and aware approach to clothing use that supports product longevity.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fcb.1739",""

Using a thematic narrative analysis, this study analyzed high school students’ perceptions of bystander behavior in their school. Results suggest bystanders are observed to enact a range of responses that fall into three categories: (a) passive avoidance, (b) victim support, or (c) joining the bullying situation. Furthermore, the motivation of bystanders was described within the themes of (a) fear, (b) individual characteristics, (c) relationships, and (d) personal experience.

Problems with veteran’s care through 2018 reveal ongoing and systematic problem. In March 2018, the VA Inspector General identified critical deficiencies at the Washington, DC VA Medical Center including failures to track patient safety events accurately, ineffective sterile processing and more than 10 thousand open or pending prosthetic/sensory aid consults. The VHA clearly has problems with access and quality in a budget-constrained environment. In this policy analysis, four separate interventions that address the gap between the magnitude as well as the use of the VHA’s fixed budget versus access and cost expectations are explored. These policy interventions include maintaining the status quo, returning to a “VHA-only” option, transitioning to a CMS central payer system and consolidating care under the DoD TRICARE insurance plans. An objective evaluation suggests that extending TRICARE to veterans during the phasing out the VHA’s care responsibilities, while politically unpalatable, would likely provide the best of four possible solutions under various criterion weighting schemes. A central payer solution under the CMS would also be a viable consideration. Results suggest that TRICARE patient perceptions of quality are superior to VHA and non-VHA/non-DoD, that access provided by the TRICARE program is ranked second in terms of venue acceptance only to the CMS solution set based on primary provider acceptance and that the cost per beneficiary of a TRICARE solution ($6.5 K/beneficiary) is far better than a VHA-only solution ($14.0 K/beneficiary), the CMS central payer solution ($12.2 K/beneficiary), or the status quo (between $12.2 K and $14.0 K/beneficiary). The intent of this paper is to provoke thoughtful consideration of solutions for providing access to high-quality healthcare for veterans within or outside of the VHA.","https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/6/3/92/pdf",""

In this article, I examine some of the practical and psychological challenges of entering into dialogue with thinkers whose background knowledge, culture, life experiences, and/or methodologies generate philosophical thought that is radically different from one's own. I contend that in order to build a discipline that is more genuinely dialogical, academic philosophers should embrace this challenging tension between incommensurable worlds of sense. Specifically, I consider how the philosophical practice of translating foreign concepts into terms that have meaning for us might be carried out in a way that preserves radical friction. I warn of the risk of projecting our ideas onto those whose worldviews are incompatible with our own, and I offer strategies for navigating this risk.","https://scholarlypublishingcollective.org/psup/speculative-philosophy/article-pdf/32/1/92/1225673/jspecphil_32_1_92.pdf",""

Based on the findings from the first research question, the authors propose a conceptual framework for understanding informal learning activities using three dimensions: learning competence, intentionality, and developmental relatedness. To answer the second question, Lewin’s field theory, which captures the importance of the person and the environment fit, was applied to identify antecedents of informal learning at the individual, group, and organizational levels. The authors then provide a critique of the state of the informal learning literature and outline targeted suggestions to guide practice and future empirical, theoretical work.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1534484318772242",""

To prevent retrograde blood flow, the two intraluminal leaflets meet in the center of the vein and occlude the vessel. In fluid‐structure interaction (FSI) simulations of venous valves, the large structural displacements may lead to mesh deteriorations and entanglements, causing instabilities of the solver and, consequently, the numerical solution to diverge. In this paper, we propose an arbitrary Lagrangian‐Eulerian (ALE) scheme for FSI simulations designed to solve these instabilities. A monolithic formulation for the FSI problem is considered, and due to the complexity of the operators, the exact Jacobian matrix is evaluated using automatic differentiation. The method relies on the introduction of a staggered in time velocity to improve stability, and on fictitious springs to model the contact force of the valve leaflets. Because the large structural displacements may compromise the quality of the fluid mesh as well, a smoother fluid displacement, obtained with the introduction of a scaling factor that measures the distance of a fluid element from the valve leaflet tip, guarantees that there are no mesh entanglements in the fluid domain. To further improve stability, a streamline upwind Petrov‐Galerkin (SUPG) method is employed. The proposed ALE scheme is applied to a two‐dimensional (2D) model of a venous valve. The presented simulations show that the proposed method deals well with the large structural displacements of the problem, allowing a reconstruction of the valve behavior in both the opening and closing phase.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fcnm.3156",""

By reducing the thicknesses of the heterostructures, an enhancement in carrier-carrier scattering is observed in the Fermi liquid behavior, followed by a metal to insulator transition in the electrical transport. The insulating behavior is described by activated transport, and its onset occurs near an occupation of 1 electron per Ti site within the SrTiO3, providing evidence for a Mott driven transition. We also discuss the role that structure and gradients in strain could play in enhancing the carrier density. The manipulation of Mott metal-insulator behavior in oxides grown directly on Si opens the pathway to harnessing strongly correlated phenomena in device technologies.","http://aip.scitation.org/doi/am-pdf/10.1063/1.5018069",""

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to gain a better understanding of how engineering students enter the engineering field by comparing commonalities across their experiences. Given recent literature that describes student dissatisfaction toward, misinformation about, and attrition in engineering programs, we explore the lived experiences of students entering the engineering field, with a particular focus on students changing their majors to engineering. Methods: This paper synthesizes the stories of 21 undergraduate engineering students from a southeastern research university, 15 of whom began their undergraduate program in other majors and transferred into engineering. We employ a unique narrative structuralizing scheme based on Campbell's hero's journey and use the metaphor of the beginning of the journey to understand student trajectories that locate students in engineering studies. Conclusions: With this information, we can better understand student conceptions of the engineering field when they enter; who enters the engineering field and why; how students’ expectations are met or not in engineering programs; and what are the factors that ultimately contribute to first‐year retention in engineering programs. In general, students entering engineering tend to have a limited understanding of what is entailed in an engineering program and benefit from interactions with advisors, teachers, and peers in the field. Such interactions may help students to more clearly decide what aspects of engineering are appropriate for them to pursue and help them to persist as they begin coursework.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fjee.20234",""

Beef shoulder clods were ground to include 100% fresh beef, 100% dry-aged beef, and a 50% fresh and 50% dry-aged ground beef blend. Samples comprised of 100% dry-aged beef were rated greatest (P < 0.001) for browned/grilled, earthy/mushroom, and nutty/roasted-nut flavors; however, panelists also detected greater (P ≤ 0.011) incidences of sour/acidic and bitter flavors. The addition of dry-aged beef increased (P < 0.001) hardness and reduced (P < 0.001) tenderness. Dry-aging also caused a shift in saturated fatty acids, where shorter chain saturated fatty acids (≤ 16:0) were reduced (P ≤ 0.034) compared to stearic acid (18:0). Meanwhile, increases of trans-octadecenoic acid (18:1 trans) and decreases of cis monounsaturated fatty acids were present in dry-aged beef. Concentrations of 18:2 conjugated linoleic isomers were greatest (P < 0.001) in fresh beef and decreased with the incorporation of dry-aged beef. Several lipid-derived volatile compounds were greater (P < 0.05) in dry-aged beef compared with fresh beef, implying a greater degree of lipid degradation among dry-aged beef. Increases (P ≤ 0.031) were determined for 3- and 2-methyl butanal with the addition of dry-aged beef. Intermediates of the Maillard reaction, 2,3-butanedione and acetoin, were determined to be greatest (P ≤ 0.046) from dry-aged beef. Alterations of fatty acids and volatile compounds with dry-aging were determined to be related with intensity of individual flavor attributes. Overall, it may be concluded that inclusion of dry-aged beef impacts flavor profile through altered fatty acid profiles and flavor related compounds. These results support the idea that dry-aging may be utilized to impart an altered ground beef flavor experience.","https://www.iastatedigitalpress.com/mmb/article/9041/galley/9375/download/",""

Numerous efforts have been made to investigate transient behaviors with fracture networks. Unfortunately, because of the complexity and the arbitrary nature of fracture networks, it is still a challenge to study transient behaviors in a computationally efficient manner. In this work, we present a mesh-free approach to investigate transient behaviors in fractured media with complex fracture networks. Contributions of properties and geometries of fracture networks to the transient behaviors were systematically analyzed. The major findings are noted: There are approximately eight transient behaviors in fractured porous media with complex fracture networks. Each behavior has its own special features, which can be used to estimate the fluid front and quantify fracture properties. Geometries of fracture networks have important impacts on the occurrence and the duration of some transient behaviors, which provide a tool to identify the fracture geometries. The fluid production in the fractured porous media is improved with high-conductivity (denser, larger) and high-complexity fracture networks.","http://onepetro.org/SJ/article-pdf/24/01/375/2121258/spe-194013-pa.pdf",""

The results from 17O-NMR measurements show that the water-exchange rates in water/[EMIm][OTf] increase with decreasing size of the lanthanide ions. This trend for water-exchange is similar to the previously reported trend in water/1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ethyl sulfate (water/[EMIm][EtSO4]) but opposite to that in water. To gain atomic-level insight into these water-exchange reactions, molecular dynamics simulations for lanthanide ions in water/[EMIm][OTf] have been performed using the atomic-multipole-optimized-energetics-for-biomolecular-application polarizable force field. Our molecular dynamics simulations reproduce the experimental water-exchange rates in terms of the trend and provide possible explanations for the observed experimental behavior. The smaller lanthanide ions in water/[EMIm][OTf] undergo faster water exchange because the smaller lanthanide ions coordinate to the first shell [OTf]− anions more tightly, resulting in a stronger screening effect for the second-shell water. The screening effect weakens the interaction of the lanthanide ions with the second-shell water molecules, facilitating the dissociation of water from the second-shell and subsequent association of water molecules from the outer solvation shells.","http://aip.scitation.org/doi/am-pdf/10.1063/1.4997008",""

Eighty percent of Mtb H37Rv infected alcohol-fed young mice died in five months compared to twenty-five percent in Mtb infected alcohol-fed old mice. There is no significant difference in lung bacterial burden of control and alcohol diet fed young and old mice. IFN-α levels were significantly higher in the lungs of Mtb infected alcohol-fed young mice and treatment with anti-IFNAR-1 antibody enhanced their survival. There are significantly higher numbers of CD11b+Ly6G+ neutrophils in the lungs of Mtb infected alcoholic young mice compared to Mtb infected alcohol-fed old mice and Mtb infected control diet-fed young mice. CD11b+Ly6G+ neutrophils are the major source of IFN-α in Mtb-infected alcohol-fed young mice and IFN-α enhanced the expression of RIP-1 and RIP-3 molecules, which are known to be involved in necroptosis. Alcohol-fed old Mtb infected mice and Mtb infected control diet-fed old and young mice expressed low level of IFN-α and RIP-1 and RIP-3 in their lungs. In response to Mtb stimulation, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from young healthy alcoholic individuals with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) produced significantly higher amounts of IFN-α compared to non-alcoholic young, alcoholic and non-alcoholic old healthy LTBI+ individuals.

To investigate this concern, resistance genes in metagenomic bovine fecal samples during a clinical trial were analyzed to assess the impacts of treatment on beef feedlot cattle resistomes. Four groups of cattle were exposed, using a 2-by-2 factorial design, to different regimens of antimicrobial treatment. Injections of ceftiofur crystalline-free acid (a third-generation cephalosporin) were used to treat all cattle in treatment pens or only a single animal, and either chlortetracycline was included in the feed of all cattle in a pen or the feed was untreated. On days 0 and 26, respectively, pre- and posttrial fecal samples were collected, and resistance genes were characterized using shotgun metagenomics. Treatment with ceftiofur was not associated with changes to β-lactam resistance genes. However, cattle fed chlortetracycline had a significant increase in relative abundance of tetracycline resistance genes. There was also an increase of an AMR class not administered during the study, which is a possible indicator of coselection of resistance genes.

These IHC protocols are fundamentally different from those used to simulate sleep apnea, a recognized cardiovascular risk factor. In clinical studies, IHC improved exercise capacity and decreased arrhythmias in patients with coronary artery or pulmonary disease and produced robust, persistent, antihypertensive effects in patients with essential hypertension. The protection afforded by IHC develops gradually and depends on β-adrenergic, δ-opioidergic, and reactive oxygen-nitrogen signaling pathways that use protein kinases and adaptive transcription factors. In summary, adaptation to intermittent hypoxia offers a practical, largely unrecognized means of protecting myocardium from impending ischemia.

Methods: Each of the 6 following bandages was applied on each horse in randomized order: (1) distal limb compression bandage (DLC), (2) double layer bandage (DL), (3) inner sanctum bandage (IS), (4) carpal compression bandage (CC), (5) tarsal compression bandage (TC), and (6) adhesive elastic carpal bandage (C‐ELA). Sub‐bandage pressures were measured with the Picopress compression measuring system (Microlab Electonica, Nicolo, Italy) after bandage application. Carpal and tarsal bandage pressures were assessed before and after walking the horses approximately 50 m. TC pressures were also measured after creating a slit over the calcaneus. A generalized linear model was used to test the association of pressure with sensor location, bandage type, time, and potential interactions ( Results: DLC (165 mmHg) and IS (167 mmHg) generated greater mean combined pressures compared with DL (146 mmHg; Conclusion: Variations to the standard DLC construct did not increase sub‐bandage pressures. CC and TC pressures rapidly decreased with ambulation, whereas C‐ELA pressures in healthy horses were not affected by walking. Clinical significance: Variations to the standard DLC offer no additional benefit in regards to increasing sub‐bandage pressures. Carpal elastic bandages maintain sub‐bandage pressures during ambulation and may be more appropriate for long term bandaging in ambulating horses. Creating a slit over the calcaneal tuber in TC bandages is discouraged due to rapid decreases in sub‐bandage pressure.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fvsu.12914",""

Modern sensors have enabled robots to learn object properties via perception of multiple modalities. However, object exploration in the real world poses a challenging trade-off between information gains and exploration action costs. Mixed observability Markov decision process (MOMDP) is a framework for planning under uncertainty, while accounting for both fully and partially observable components of the state. Robot perception frequently has to face such mixed observability. This work enables a robot equipped with an arm to dynamically construct query-oriented MOMDPs for multi-modal predicate identification (MPI) of objects. The robot's behavioral policy is learned from two datasets collected using real robots. Our approach enables a robot to explore object properties in a way that is significantly faster while improving accuracies in comparison to existing methods that rely on hand-coded exploration strategies.","",""

An impingement hole array was used to model the turbine vane cooling passage, so that the flow interactions between neighboring jets could be accounted for. The Discrete Phase Model in ANSYS Fluent was used to predict the particle impact locations, after convergence of the flow field simulation. Deposition results were obtained for an inlet-to-outlet pressure ratio of 1.015 with back pressure of 1 atm and three temperatures (300 K, 700 K and 1000 K).

Diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP), one of the main consequences of diabetes mellitus, is extremely difficult to treat. Current medications yield limited benefits and/or have severe adverse effects. Therefore, new, effective treatment is needed. METHODS:: Streptozotocin at 55 mg/kg was injected intraperitoneally in rats to induce diabetes mellitus. Diabetic rats exhibiting neuropathic pain underwent intrathecal injection of purified agrin proteins at various doses and were then tested for tactile allodynia to evaluate whether DNP was inhibited. The agrin effects were also analyzed with patch-clamp recording on spinal cord slices. RESULTS:: Fifty–kilo Dalton agrin (Agr50) at 0.2 and 2 ng suppressed DNP when given intrathecally, while 25- and 75-kDa agrin (Agr25, Agr75) had little effect. The suppressive effect of Agr50 lasted 4 hours after a single bolus injection. The difference in effects of Agr50 on mean withdrawal threshold (4.6 ± 2.2 g before treatment to 26 ± 0 g after treatment) compared with that of Agr25 (4.9 ± 2.0 g to 4.9 ± 2.0 g) and Agr75 (5.3 ± 2.3 g to 9.2 ± 2.5 g) was highly significant ( CONCLUSIONS:: Agr50 had a potent suppressive effect on DNP and increased spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents and action potential firing rate from GABA neurons. Therefore, Agr50 may provide a potential therapy for DNP.","https://journals.lww.com/00000539-201810000-00035",""

Results support the idea that relative anger prototypicality, in this case, the extent to which people believe that their own anger toward politicians is representative of most Americans’ anger, predicts feelings of group‐based relative deprivation.

Second, the distinctions between “wars of choice” and “wars of necessity,” and about the “kind of war” being fought, key theoretical variables mentioned by the author, are hard to judge objectively.

The semianalytical model included three domains: matrix, hydraulic-fracture networks, and discrete natural fractures. Using the line-source function, we developed the diffusivity equation for fluid flow in matrix. By applying the vertex-analysis technique, we eliminated the flow interplay at fracture intersections and established the diffusivity equations for fluid flow in hydraulic-fracture networks and isolated natural fractures. The pressure-transient solution of these diffusivity equations was obtained using Laplace transforms and the Stehfest numerical inversion.","http://onepetro.org/SJ/article-pdf/23/06/2041/2116115/spe-187290-pa.pdf",""

Using a model of an electronic marketplace in which two competing manufacturers sell their products through a common retail platform, we study the effect of recommender systems on the retail platform, manufacturers, consumer surplus, and social welfare. In our setting, consumers are differentiated with respect to their preference for the two products (locational differentiation) and awareness about the two products (informational differentiation). A recommender system selects the recommendation based on a recommendation score, which is a weighted sum of expected retailer profit and expected consumer value. We find that the recommender system may benefit or hurt the retailer and the manufacturers depending on the signs and magnitudes of the substitution effect and demand effect of the recommender system. The substitution effect of the recommender system either intensifies or softens the price competition between two manufacturers through two forces—its direct influence alters the informational differentiation of consumers (which affects the markup that manufacturers can charge), and its strategic influence motivates the manufacturers to use price as a lever to attract more recommendations in their favor. The demand effect of the recommender system increases overall consumer awareness, but, depending on the substitution effect, may increase or decrease the demand. The recommendation strategy, namely, the relative weight assigned to retailer profit vis-á-vis consumer value in computing the recommendation score, along with recommender system precision and the relative sizes of segments of consumers with different awareness levels, determines whether the retailer benefits from the recommender system and by how much. We find that the retailer’s optimal recommendation strategy is mildly profit oriented in the sense that it assigns a larger, but not too large, weight to retailer profit compared to consumer value, and that under the optimal strategy, the price competition is less intense and the retailer profit is higher compared to when there is no recommender system. Furthermore, an increase in either the recommender system precision or the fraction of consumers that are aware of at least one product induces the retailer to adopt a more profit-oriented recommendation strategy.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/isre.2017.0765",""

The results revealed that occupational commitment mediated and explained the positive relationship between FIW and occupational turnover intentions but not the relationship between WIF and occupational turnover intentions. In addition, perceptions of organizational support influenced the relationship between occupational commitment and occupational turnover intentions and also the indirect relationship between FIW and occupational turnover intentions. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings as well as future research directions are discussed.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fhrm.21900",""

While these scholars have foregrounded objects’ relations within existing assemblages, new materialist philosophers draw attention to properties of objects that transcend those relations and might indicate opportunities for more creative or generative uses of Big Data and analytics.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2053951718818194",""

PDAs are commonly used in real-world energy markets to trade energy in specific time slots to balance demand on the power grid. Strategically, bidding in a PDA is complicated because the bidder must predict and plan for future auctions that may influence the bidding strategy for the current auction. We present a general bidding strategy for PDAs based on forecasting clearing prices and using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to plan a bidding strategy across multiple time periods. In addition, we present a fast heuristic strategy that can be used either as a standalone method or as an initial set of bids to seed the MCTS policy. We evaluate our bidding strategies using a PDA simulator based on the wholesale market implemented in the Power Trading Agent Competition (PowerTAC) competition. We demonstrate that our strategies outperform state-of-the-art bidding strategies designed for that competition.","",""

Zinc sulfide (ZnS) was anaerobically biosynthesized to produce CompA, which was further processed by cryomilling to maximize the antibacterial properties to produce CompB. The effect of the two compounds on the S. aureus strain AH133 was compared using zone of inhibition assay. The compounds were formulated in a polyethylene glycol cream. We compared the effect of the two compounds on biofilm development by AH133 and two methicillin-resistant S. aureus clinical isolates using the in vitro model of wound infection. Zone of inhibition assay revealed that CompB is more effective than CompA. At 15 mg/application, the formulated cream of either compound inhibited biofilm development by AH133, which was confirmed using confocal laser scanning microscopy. At 20 mg/application, CompB inhibited biofilm development by the two methicillin-resistant S. aureus clinical isolates. To further validate the effectiveness of CompB, mice were treated using the murine model of wound infection.

Honduran-sourced strip loins (n = 10/treatment) included: 1) dual-purpose bulls, raised on native pasture (HDP), 2) F1 crossbred Brahman bulls finished on a corn-based grain diet for 180 d (HCF), and 3) purebred Brahman bulls finished on a sugarcane-based diet for 180 d (HSC). Ten additional strip loins from each Honduran treatment were selected and enhanced (E; 112% Â± 3.5%) with water, salt, and tripolyphosphate, resulting in EHDP, EHCF, and EHSC. Steaks were cooked to 77Â°C prior to consumer evaluation of tenderness, juiciness, and flavor and overall liking, with classification of each trait as acceptable or unacceptable. Consumers indicated if they were willing to pay 0, 3, 6, or 10 USD/0.45 kg. Consumer data were analyzed using the GLIMMIX procedure of SAS as a split plot design, with treatment as the whole plot factor and country and the country Ã— treatment interaction as the subplot factors, including panel as a random effect. The EHCF had greater (P &lt; 0.05) scores for tenderness, juiciness, flavor and overall liking. No differences (P &gt; 0.05) were found between TC and SE when scoring palatability traits, but more (P &lt; 0.05) consumers found TC acceptable for juiciness compared to SE. Honduran consumers ranked all palatability traits greater than U.S consumers and found a greater percentage of samples acceptable for tenderness (P &lt; 0.05). Enhancement of Honduran treatments had a positive effect on palatability traits, as well as the acceptability of those traits. Regardless of the differences in breeds, using high-energy diets and enhancement resulted in greater palatability scores.","https://www.iastatedigitalpress.com/mmb/article/11235/galley/10566/download/",""

This letter presents an easily integrated heel charger to efficiently convert kinematic walking energy into electricity. The heel charger uses a multilayered levered piezoelectric (L-Pie) mechanism associated with a nonlinear mechanical-synchronized switching on inductor circuit (M-SSHI) interface. It tactfully switches on when the foot contacts the ground, and switches off when the foot is lifted. This design takes full advantage of the user's weight, and amplifies footstep displacement by utilizing the lever mechanism to gain maximum deformation of multilayer piezoelectric patches. The experimental results show that the fabricated two-level multilayer L-pie has a top performance of 13.60 mW of AC RMS, a mechanical to AC power conversion efficiency of 7.87%, and a DC RMS power of 6.13 mW, an AC to DC power conversion efficiency of 45.07%, under a harmonic excitation of 2.3 Hz (mimicking fast walking speed: 6.2 km/h for men, 5.55 km/h for women). With an optimal load of 210 kΩ, the two-level L-pie using the M-SSHI has an improvement of 206.45% in DC RMS power compared to a standard 4-diode bridge energy harvesting circuit. The L-pie design works more efficiently under large force excitation, even with small displacement, which makes this technology optimal for footstep energy harvesting.","http://aip.scitation.org/doi/am-pdf/10.1063/1.5041259",""

Rotary ultrasonic machining (RUM) is a non-traditional machining process that has been successfully used to drill CFRP, many other brittle (e.g. silicon, ceramics), and ductile (e.g. titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V), stainless steel) materials. RUM is superior to twist drilling on CFRP hole-making in many aspects: lower cutting force and torque, better surface finish, less potential for delamination, and better tool life. Since RUM is a hybrid process of abrasive grinding and ultrasonic machining, it is important to study the effects of abrasive properties on output variables. This paper for the first time investigates the effects of abrasive properties (abrasive size and abrasive concentration) on output variables (cutting force, torque, and surface roughness) in RUM of CFRP. It is found that cutting force increased as abrasive size increased and as abrasive concentration increased; however, abrasive properties did not have significant effects on surface roughness of the machined holes.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/MSEC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/MSEC2018-6631/2520767/v004t03a060-msec2018-6631.pdf",""

To date no studies have determined what topics new graduates need to be able to communicate. Objective:: To explore the opinions of athletic training preceptors as to what topics need to be communicated with a variety of stakeholders. Specifically, we wanted to explore what topics are communicated, what barriers exist to getting students involved in professional communication, and what strategies could be used to overcome those barriers. Design and Setting:: A qualitative design involving in-depth focus-group interviews. Interviews were conducted in a controlled environment. Patients or Other Participants:: Athletic trainers from 3 work settings were included: high school (3 male and 3 female; average age 32.5 ± 6.1 years), college/university/junior college (5 male and 1 female; average age 34.5 ± 6.8 years), and clinic/emerging practices (1 male and 4 female; average age 27.4 ± 2.8 years). Main Outcome Measure(s):: Focus-group interviews were audiotaped and then transcribed verbatim and analyzed deductively. Peer debriefing and member checks were used to ensure trustworthiness. Results:: The most often-cited topics to communicate were related to prognosis of the injury with limitations and return to play. The most often-cited barrier to getting students involved was related to interpersonal relationships, with participants noting that it was their role to lead the communication. The most often-cited strategy for getting students involved was challenging the student to do something he had not done before. Conclusions:: It is not realistic to expect new graduates to be proficient at communication if they are not given opportunities while enrolled as students. Preceptors should consider utilizing strategies to overcome barriers and get students more involved. Furthermore, it is important that employers anticipate these deficiencies and mentor new employees appropriately.","http://meridian.allenpress.com/atej/article-pdf/13/2/175/1453358/1302175.pdf",""

We evaluated this model in a sample of 709 working adults from the National Survey of Midlife Development II in the United States. Results indicate that, through occupational prestige and subsequent psychological job demands and financial well‐being, GMA was related to work‐to‐family conflict (WFC) and family‐to‐work conflict (FWC). GMA was also related to work‐to‐family enrichment (WFE) but not family‐to‐work enrichment (FWE) through occupational prestige and autonomy. In contrast, conscientiousness did not influence work–family outcomes through occupational prestige. Additionally, GMA and conscientiousness were both related to WFE/FWE through problem coping, whereas conscientiousness was related to FWC through avoidance coping. Examining the relative effects of GMA and conscientiousness, we found that the indirect effects of GMA through occupational prestige were stronger than those of conscientiousness, whereas the indirect effects of conscientiousness through problem coping were stronger than those of GMA.

However, we consider the possibility that such knowledge and experience increase the likelihood of material misstatement when executives have incentives to misreport. We use executives' prior experience as an audit manager or partner as a measure of extensive accounting and financial reporting competence. We find that the interaction of this measure and compensation-based incentives increases the likelihood of misstatements. Further, auditors discount the audit fee premium associated with compensation-based incentives when executives have accounting competence. Together, our results suggest that a dark side of accounting competence emerges in the presence of certain incentives, but auditors view accounting competence favorably despite the heightened risk. In further analyses, we demonstrate that executives' aggressive attitude toward reporting exacerbates the effect of accounting competence and compensation-based incentives on misstatements, but not on audit fees.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article-pdf/93/6/1/37344/accr-52028.pdf",""

Improvements in palatability were observed due to grain-finishing mature cattle, suggesting an adequate degree of marbling could offset negative palatability traits typically associated with beef from mature cattle.","https://www.iastatedigitalpress.com/mmb/article/9037/galley/9451/download/",""

The new features of immunotherapy make the traditional clinical trial paradigm increasingly inefficient and dysfunctional. We propose a Bayesian phase I–II design for immunotherapy trials called BDFIT to find the optimal biological dose (OBD). We jointly model the toxicity outcome, progression-free survival (PFS) and immune response. PFS and toxicity are used as the primary end points to determine the OBD, whereas the immune response is used as an ancillary end point to screen out futile doses quickly and to predict the PFS when needed. A utility function is formulated to account for the risk–benefit trade-off and to quantify the desirability of the dose. During the trial, based on accumulating data, the estimates of the model and dose desirability are continuously updated and used to guide the dose assignment and to select the OBD. The simulation study shows that the BDFIT design has desirable operating characteristics.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Frssc.12288",""

So far, the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center has demonstrated a high sensitivity for optical temperature monitoring in biological systems. However, the NV center requires microwave excitation which can cause unwanted heating, and the NV is also sensitive to non-axial magnetic fields, both of which can result in inaccurate temperature measurements. To overcome this drawback, the silicon-vacancy (SiV) and germanium-vacancy (GeV) color centers in diamonds have recently been explored and have shown good optical temperature sensitivity owing to the temperature dependent wavelength optical zero-phonon line. Here, we report optical temperature measurements using the recently discovered tin-vacancy (SnV) color center in diamond and show sensitivity better than 0.2 K in 10 s integration time. Also, we compare the relative merits of SnV with respect to SiV and GeV for luminescent thermometry. These results illustrate that there are likely to be many future options for nanoscale thermometry using diamonds.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.5037053/14511396/241902_1_online.pdf",""

The quality of tissue joints and potential thermal damage to the surroundings are the two main concerns when using electrosurgical tissue joining tools. A more robust method for quality control is still needed. In this study, we developed an experimental setup to join tissues and performed tensile tests to evaluate the quality of the tissue joint, while also monitoring the process parameters including voltage, current, impedance, temperature and thermal dose. Three joining times (4, 6, and 8 seconds) and three compression levels (80%, 90%, and 95%) were used to join porcine arterial tissues. It was found that 95% compression can form a strong joint with a shorter joining time and less energy, but the joint strength decreases when the joining time is extended to 8 seconds. A lower compression level can still form a quality joint but requires longer joining time and energy which could lead to more thermal damages. A new index, specific strength (mmHg/J), which is defined as the ratio between tensile strength and the consumed energy, is proposed. Specific strength offers a new way to estimate the required joining time to achieve sufficient joining strength while minimizing the energy consumption to reduce thermal damages.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/MSEC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/MSEC2018-6637/2520020/v001t05a008-msec2018-6637.pdf",""

We examine whether known risk factors for birth defects explain the higher prevalence observed for selected birth defects among this population. Methods: Data from 12 population‐based birth defects surveillance systems, covering a birth population of 11 million from 1999 to 2007, were used to examine prevalence of birth defects that have previously been reported to have elevated prevalence among AI/ANs. Prevalence ratios (PRs) were calculated for non‐Hispanic AI/ANs and any AI/ANs (regardless of Hispanic ethnicity), adjusting for maternal age, education, diabetes, and smoking, as well as type of case‐finding ascertainment surveillance system. Results: After adjustment, the birth prevalence of two of seven birth defects remained significantly elevated among AI/ANs compared to non‐Hispanic whites (NHWs): anotia/microtia was almost threefold higher, and cleft lip +/− cleft palate was almost 70% higher compared to NHWs. Excluding AI/AN subjects who were also Hispanic had only a negligible impact on adjusted PRs. Conclusions: Additional covariates accounted for some of the elevated birth defect prevalences among AI/ANs compared to NHWs. Exclusion of Hispanic ethnicity from the AI/AN category had little impact on birth defects prevalences in AI/ANs. NHWs serve as a viable comparison group for analysis.

We find that while domestic investors lead foreign investors in firm-specific information, the latter are better at incorporating macro-level information into stock prices. Thus, our results indicate that, in contrast to conventional beliefs, foreign investors are not at an absolute information disadvantage in emerging markets. In addition, we find that domestic investors' firm-specific information advantage is weakened among firms that have higher accounting quality and in situations where foreign investors face fewer cultural and communication barriers. Taken together, our paper indicates the key information role played by foreign investors and the importance of financial reporting quality in emerging markets.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-horizons/article-pdf/33/1/17/16476/acch-52341.pdf",""

The NZBC problem is more complex due to the intricate branching structure of the associated linear eigenfunctions. Two cases are analyzed, which correspond to two different values of the phase at infinity. Special soliton solutions are discussed and explicit 1‐soliton and 2‐soliton solutions are found.

This article examines the instructional risk messages offered in the days that followed the 2014 infection and death of Liberian national Thomas Eric Duncan in Dallas, Texas. More specifically, we apply the IDEA model for effective instructional risk and crisis communication embellished by exemplification theory to conduct a thematic analysis of messages offered locally (Dallas news stories and press releases), nationally (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Live Chat Twitter posts), and internationally (website content from the World Health Organization, the United Nations Children’s Fund, and Doctors Without Borders). Our conclusions reveal that the majority of messages offered from each organization privileged the element of explanation over internalization and action as well as negative over positive exemplification. On the basis of these conclusions, and informed by previous research, we propose a number of potential implications and recommendations for offering a balanced representation among internalization, explanation, and action as proposed in the IDEA model. We also suggest that positive exemplification could be used strategically to motivate receivers to attend to these messages (internalization), reduce potential misunderstandings (explanation), and take appropriate self-protective actions (action). Agency spokespersons and media reporters may find the conclusions and recommendations drawn from this analysis to be useful when crafting similar instructional risk preparedness and crisis response messages.","",""

We tested this hypothesis using a novel model, altricial red-winged blackbird nestlings, predicting that the proportion of DHA in muscle and liver membranes should increase with the increasing metabolic rate of the nestling as it develops endothermy. We also used a dietary manipulation, supplementing the natural diet with fish oil (high DHA) or sunflower oil (high linoleic acid) to alter membrane composition and then assessed metabolic rate. In support of the membrane pacemaker hypothesis, DHA proportions increased in membranes from pectoralis muscle, muscle mitochondria, and liver during post-hatch development. By contrast, elevated dietary DHA had no effect on resting metabolic rate, despite causing significant changes to membrane lipid composition. During cold challenges, higher metabolic rates were achieved by birds that had lower DHA and higher linoleic acid in membrane phospholipids. Given the mixed support for this hypothesis, we conclude that correlations between membrane DHA and metabolic rate are likely spurious, and should be attributed to a still-unidentified confounding variable.","http://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article-pdf/doi/10.1242/jeb.174466/1906809/jeb174466.pdf",""

Yoga is a nonpharmacological strategy that has been shown to improve symptoms in other cancers and may be effective for improving symptoms in MPN patients. Online yoga helps address many of the commonly reported barriers of cancer patients to in-person interventions and may make yoga more accessible to MPNs. An exploration of MPN patient perceptions of participation in online yoga is needed to tailor interventions to patient needs and inform future studies. The purpose of this study was to explore the perceptions of MPN patients participating in a 12-week online yoga intervention. This article represents the combined qualitative interview data from two studies. Participants were asked to complete 60 min/wk of online, home-based yoga and were asked to participate in a 15- to 20-minute phone interview postintervention. The qualitative data was coded in NVivo 11 for content analysis. The total sample included 39 MPN patients. Online yoga was well accepted and liked among these patients. They reported physical (eg, improved sleep, reduced fatigue) and mental (eg, reduced stress) health benefits and liked the convenience of being able to do yoga at home. Online yoga provides a feasible and attractive format through which to deliver a nonpharmacological intervention among MPN patients. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the effects of online yoga on MPN patient symptoms. The qualitative findings presented here help inform the development of these future trials.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1534735418808595",""

Access management is particularly important near signalized intersections, where adjacent driveways exacerbate the crash risks created by conflict points at the primary intersection. This study examines the relationship between crash risk and access spacing in the vicinity of 415 signalized urban intersections. The frequency of access points near each signalized intersection of interest was collected to examine the differences in experienced crash frequency over a five-year period. Additional information about each access point was collected, including details of turning movement restrictions and estimated driveway volumes. A series of buffers of varying radii were considered to examine how crash rates varied based upon the spatial proximity of access points to each signalized intersection. In addition, traffic volume and roadway geometric information was collected and utilized as a part of this evaluation. A series of crash prediction models were estimated to discern how crash rates varied based upon the access point density on the intersection approaches along the major (i.e., higher volume) roadway. As the number of access points increased, the crash rates also increased. This relationship was consistent in direction, but varied in magnitude, depending on the size of the buffers, which varied in radius from 50 ft to 600 ft at 50-ft intervals. The number of crashes by location was also shown to vary based upon the number of travel lanes, the number of intersection legs, and the land use type of the adjacent driveways.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0361198118795997",""

However, prior research also suggests that auditors, on average, are not adept at identifying and constraining these differences. This study investigates whether certain auditors and audit committees are able to lower fraud risk by constraining inconsistencies between financial and related nonfinancial measures (NFMs). For a sample of companies across a variety of industries, we find that auditors with greater industry expertise and tenure and audit committee chairs with greater tenure are less likely to be associated with companies that exhibit large inconsistencies between their reported revenue growth and related NFMs. Surprisingly, we observe that audit committees with industry expert chairs are more likely to be associated with large inconsistencies (higher fraud risk) than audit committees without industry expert chairs.","https://publications.aaahq.org/ajpt/article-pdf/38/1/103/50416/ajpt-52087.pdf",""

It can be derived from either GAAP financial statements or IRS Form 990. However, these sources have conflicting disclosure requirements that can significantly affect the ratio. The FASB has consolidation requirements for GAAP financial statements, but allows wide latitude in how program-specific functional expenses are disclosed. The IRS requires disclosure of functional expenses on Form 990, but allows wide latitude in how the reporting entity is defined. Thus, the program ratio can vary significantly based on the accounting choices of management. We examine the association of program ratios and consolidation choices in NP hospitals using Form 990 data. We find that hospitals receiving support from unconsolidated affiliates realize significantly higher program ratios. The IRS and FASB should consider this finding when evaluating the latitude in reporting requirements for NP hospitals.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-horizons/article-pdf/32/4/147/16866/acch-52180.pdf",""

Through these readings the authors enact a fusion of horizons, a possibility forwarded by Gadamer as a critique of Enlightenment-based onto-epistemologies, which situate prejudice as a reminder to engage in expansive knowledge-making moves. De/colonial scholars add arguments about positionality and the need to engage with one’s own stuck places, places of contradictions and tensions, and conditions that cultivate deep introspection. The politics of evidence-based research continues to stifle and discipline the ways in which qualitative research can be engaged.

Our results show that whites experienced an increase in their exposure to black and other minority neighbors and a concurrent decrease in same–race neighbors. Blacks’ exposure to both black and white neighbors declined somewhat between 2001 and 2011, while their exposure to nonblack minority neighbors increased substantially. Decomposition analysis reveals that increases in whites’ exposure to black neighbors were driven primarily by in situ neighborhood change (i.e., by change surrounding nonmobile neighborhood residents), and only secondarily by shifting patterns of migration to neighborhoods containing more blacks and fewer whites. Changes in blacks’ exposure to white neighbors were shaped by two countervailing forces. While the neighborhoods inhabited by non–mobile blacks became relatively less black and more white, residentially mobile blacks were increasingly moving to neighborhoods that were more black and less white. Increases in blacks’ and whites’ neighborhood ethnoracial diversity were driven almost entirely by in situ changes around nonmobile blacks and whites.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fcico.12315",""

However, it is not known if exposure to the antidepressant fluoxetine, in female subjects specifically, changes sensitivity to natural and drug rewards, later in life. Aims:: The aim of this work was to investigate if exposure to fluoxetine mediates enduring changes in sensitivity to the rewarding properties of cocaine and sucrose, using female mice as a model system. Methods:: We exposed C57BL/6 female mice to fluoxetine (250 mg/L in their drinking water) for 15 consecutive days, either during adolescence (postnatal day 35–49) or adulthood (postnatal day 70–84). Twenty-one days later, mice were examined on their behavioral reactivity to cocaine (0, 2.5, 5, 7.5 mg/kg) using the conditioned place preference paradigm, or assessed on the two-bottle sucrose (1%) test. Results:: We found that regardless of age of antidepressant exposure, female mice pre-exposed to fluoxetine displayed reliable conditioning to the cocaine-paired compartment. However, when compared to respective age-matched controls, antidepressant pre-exposure decreased the magnitude of conditioning at the 5 and 7.5 mg/kg cocaine doses. Furthermore, fluoxetine pre-exposure reduced sucrose preference without altering total liquid intake. Conclusions:: The data suggest that pre-exposure to fluoxetine, during adolescence or adulthood, results in a prolonged decrease in sensitivity to the rewarding properties of both natural and drug rewards in female C57BL/6 mice.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0269881118805488",""

We examine the determinants of populist foreign policy rhetoric in the case of Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez. We argue that a leftist populist leader such as Chávez will focus on anti-imperialist themes, and we consider two mechanisms that may indicate the conditions under which he will use them: diversion, which would typically be expected from a populist, and capacity. We use time-series analysis of rhetorical data scraped from the entire corpus of Aló Presidente—Chávez’s weekly television series—to test our hypotheses. The evidence supports the capacity mechanism, that Chávez is emboldened to use anti-imperialist rhetoric when the price of oil is high. His rhetoric, thus, matches his resources and ability to provide domestic and international goods to support his own identity as a protector and savior of the common people from domestic and global elites engaged in the imperialistic enterprise.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1065912918784212",""

However, the workability of concrete is not completely measured or specified by current standard tests. Furthermore, it is only with a clear picture of cement hydration and setting that full prediction and control of concrete performance can be generalized. In order to investigate the rheological properties of blended cement pastes, a rotational viscometer (RV) was used to determine the flow characteristics of ordinary and blended pastes to provide assurance that it can be pumped and handled. Additionally, a dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) was used to characterize both the viscous and elastic components of pastes. Ordinary Portland cement paste and blended pastes (slag, fly ash, and silica fume) were investigated in this study. The stress and strain of the blended specimens were measured by the DSR, which characterizes both viscous and elastic behaviors by measuring the complex shear modulus (the ratio of total shear stress to total shear strain) and phase angle (an indicator of the relative amounts of recoverable and nonrecoverable deformation) of materials. Cement pastes generally exhibit different rheological behaviors with respect to age, mineral admixture type, and cement replacement level.","http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/amse/2018/6303681.pdf",""

The purpose of this paper is to add to this body of knowledge through the study of burnout among direct‐care workers in nursing homes. Background: Perhaps the factor most often associated with employee burnout is the level of staffing—insufficient staffing results in work overload and eventually employee burnout. A closer look at research findings suggests that there are many other factors also contributing to burnout. These range from those at the organisational level, such as availability of training and resources to individual characteristics such as self‐esteem and length of employment. Methods: A self‐administered survey instrument was completed by 410 direct‐care workers working within 11 nursing homes in the north Texas region. Regression analyses were performed, adjusting for clustering by nursing home. Beta coefficients and structure coefficients are reported. Burnout was measured through three dimensions: emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation and personal accomplishment. Results: Organisational, work design, interpersonal and individual characteristics were found to be associated with one or more dimensions of burnout. Conclusions: The analyses largely support previous research. Organisational variables of significance included the availability of resources to do the work, available training and fair pay. Work design variables of significance included adequate staffing. The individual characteristic, self‐esteem, appeared to have the strongest impact on burnout. Commitment to the organisation also had a large impact. Relevance to clinical practice: While the data do not allow for the testing of causal relationships, the data do suggest that providing adequate staffing, perceived fair pay, sufficient work resources (e.g., towels, gowns), management support and adequate training may result in less direct‐care worker burnout on the job.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fjocn.14267",""

Methods:: Frequencies of breastfeeding and cosleeping by 285 mothers from the Women, Work, and Wee Ones cohort are reported as related to mothers' work schedule, marital status, or mother or infant health. Conclusions:: Breastfeeding rates were about 30% across most maternal characteristics. The frequency of mothers’ breastfeeding was higher when mothers were both breastfeeding and cosleeping (breastfeeding-cosleeping), in comparison with breastfeeding only, as evident for mothers with nonstandard work schedules. Cosleeping was common across all mothers. Breastfeeding rates were low, perhaps reflecting challenges of early care. Premature infants were more likely to be cosleeping than breastfeeding. Approximately 30% of mothers breastfed across the different factors examined. Implications for practice:: The information may help nurse practitioners in addressing early care needs and supporting breastfeeding across groups. Younger mothers were least likely to breastfeed and reported higher frequency of cosleeping. Overall breastfeeding frequency was higher when mothers were cosleeping.

Finally, we assessed selective uptake of yolk by comparing the yolk fatty acid composition of freshly laid eggs and day-old hatchlings. Relative to other altricial species, blackbirds achieved high DHA in brain phospholipids (20% of phospholipid fatty acids in day-old hatchlings). This was not a result of selective uptake from the yolk, but rather a consequence of a high proportion of DHA in the yolk (2.5% of total lipids) at laying.

Method: We first collect a data set of monthly counts of relevant articles published in two prominent Canadian newspapers and then estimate Markov‐switching models to evaluate whether increases in media attention to homosexuality are coincident with judicial decisions enhancing gay rights in Canada. Results: Each of five landmark gay rights decisions is coincident with a period of heightened media attention to homosexuality. The data show that Canadian newspapers publish nearly twice as many relevant stories during these “active” regimes compared to “inactive” periods. Conclusion: Canadian courts can increase attention to issues in the national media. This result supports a dynamic view of the interaction between courts and democratic majorities in place of the static view of democracy endemic to normative discourse about judicial countermajoritarianism.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fssqu.12496",""

Consensus guidelines recommend use of multiple antiemetics from different mechanistic classes as prophylaxis in patients at high risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting. The prophylactic efficacy of the dopamine D2/D3 antagonist amisulpride in combination with other antiemetics was investigated. Methods: This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, international, multicenter trial was conducted in 1,147 adult surgical patients having three or four postoperative nausea and vomiting risk factors. Patients were randomized to receive either intravenous amisulpride (5 mg) or matching placebo at induction of general anesthesia, in addition to one standard, nondopaminergic antiemetic, most commonly ondansetron or dexamethasone. Vomiting/retching, nausea, and use of rescue medication were recorded for 24 h after wound closure. The primary endpoint was complete response, defined as no emesis or rescue medication use in the 24-h postoperative period. Results: Complete response occurred in 330 of 572 (57.7%) of the amisulpride group and 268 of 575 (46.6%) of the control group (difference 11.1 percentage points; 95% CI, 5.3 to 16.8; P &lt; 0.001).

Many programs using multiple interventions have been designed, implemented, and studied to achieve this goal. To synthesize what has been learned from studies of these programs, this article presents a systematic review of published studies of programs designed to support Latinx student success in 2‐year institutions and successful transfer to 4‐year institutions, particularly for STEM majors. A total of 49 quantitative, 9 qualitative, and 16 mixed‐methods studies published as reports, articles, or dissertations since 1980 were identified that met the criteria for the review. Studies covered a wide range of interventions, including mentoring, counseling, advising, study groups, tutoring, scholarships, orientations, career services, undergraduate research, articulation agreements, and transfer programs. Individually, these studies report positive influences on student success outcomes, including 2‐ and 4‐year graduation, transfer to a 4‐year institution, retention, and success in individual courses. However, the number of qualifying studies was surprisingly small, considering the importance of improving success of Latinx students and the length of time during which the problem has been repeatedly emphasized. Few interventions have been undertaken from explicitly assets‐based perspectives or theoretical frameworks. The lack of explicit frameworks underlying interventions—combined with a sole/primary focus on students—suggests many interventions were approached from a deficit‐based perspective. Further, the study found no pattern of replication studies that might confirm effectiveness of potentially promising interventions. Based on our analysis of evaluations presented in the studies, it does not appear that the research community has developed agreed‐upon methods to evaluate commonly agreed‐upon outcomes. Finally, no intervention has been sufficiently supported that widespread implementation could be recommended.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Ftea.21485",""

We demonstrate that endorsements from particularly well‐connected interest groups are a strong cue for members with limited information early in the legislative process and help grow the list of bill cosponsors. As bills progress, such groups have less direct weight, while legislation supported by a larger number of organizations and a larger number of cosponsors is more likely to pass.

When liquid is drawn up into a capillary and then released under gravity, inertia allows the meniscus to overshoot the equilibrium capillary rise height. The meniscus then rebounds up the tube, again overshooting the equilibrium height and undergoes oscillation. By varying both the immersion depth and radius of the tube, one can observe rich dynamical behavior, with the most dramatic being the formation of a fast liquid jet, barely visible to the naked eye but easily captured with high-speed video. In addition to the flow separation caused by the sudden expansion at the end of the tube, this jet serves as a mechanism of energy dissipation. Some qualitative differences between the works of Quere et al. [“Rebounds in a capillary tube,” Langmuir 15, 3679–3682 (1999)] and Lorenceau et al. [“Gravitational oscillations of a liquid column in a pipe,” Phys. Fluids 14(6), 1985–1992 (2002)] and the present experiment are observed and discussed. A critical condition for oscillatory behavior is derived theoretically and matches well with the experimental observation. Once in the oscillatory regime, both the maximum depth below and the maximum rebound height above the equilibrium level are investigated by performing a systematic sweep through the relevant parameter space, incorporating the initial meniscus height, immersion depth, tube radius, and fluid properties. Lastly, the characteristic period of oscillation, tp, is assessed and found to be largely independent of fluid viscosity, and could be reasonably well-collapsed by a single curve whereby tp∼hi, where hi is the tube immersion depth.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.5038662/13684652/082103_1_online.pdf",""

To understand the underlying mechanism how over-expression of miR-155 in liver induces pathologic changes linking early liver damage to malignant HCC development, we have generated conditional transgenic and knockout mice for hepatocyte-specific over-expression or deletion of miR-155 using Cre-LoxP technology. Although the miR-155 over-expressing Tg mice did not develop spontaneous HCC, they showed early inflammation in liver with elevated level of pro-inflammatory cytokines in both liver and serum through Caspase-I activation. Postnatal insulting by genotoxin, Diethylnitrosamine (DEN), has dramatically increased incidents of HCC in miR-155 Tg mice (82%) compared to wildtype mice (21%) by 9 months. Microarray analysis on whole mouse liver transcriptome has revealed that 294 genes were significantly up-regulated in the Tg mice while 147 genes were significantly down-regulated. Further pathway analysis showed that those affected genes mainly involve in acute-phase response, inflammatory response, fatty acid metabolic process, and cholesterol metabolic process, which coincides with our phenotypic observation. In addition, it was found that high incidence of HCC by DEN insult is consequence of impaired DNA damage repair and apoptosis pathways through downregulation of several genes including Foxo3a, Sirt1, C/EBP-beta and Smac by miR-155. Our in vivo study provides first insight of dysregulation of single microRNA can set forth liver damage to malignant HCC, which makes miR-155 a promising therapeutic target not only for HCC but also many type of liver damage-related liver diseases.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/78/13_Supplement/LB-387/631263/Abstract-LB-387-In-vivo-study-on-the-pathological",""

Traditional approaches to quantify river geometry have involved surveyed river cross sections, which cannot be extended to ungaged basins. In this paper, we describe a method for developing a synthetic rating curve to relate flow to water level in a stream reach based on reach‐averaged channel geometry properties developed using the Height above Nearest Drainage (HAND) method. HAND uses a digital elevation model (DEM) of the terrain and computes the elevation difference between each land surface cell and the stream bed cell to which it drains. Taking increments in water level in the stream, HAND defines the inundation zone and a water depth grid within this zone, and the channel characteristics are defined from this water depth grid. We apply our method to the Blanco River (Texas) and the Tar River (North Carolina) using 10‐m terrain data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) 3D Elevation Program (3DEP) dataset. We evaluate the method's performance by comparing the reach‐average stage‐river geometry relationships and rating curves to those from calibrated Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC‐RAS) models and USGS gage observations. The results demonstrate that after some adjustment, the river geometry information and rating curves derived from HAND using national‐coverage datasets are comparable to those obtained from hydraulic models or gage measurements. We evaluate the inundation extent and show our approach is able to capture the majority of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) 100‐year floodplain.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2F1752-1688.12661",""

The top three significant stressors associated with suicide are health, pressure, and death, which are similar to previous studies. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using natural language processing approaches to unlock information from psychiatric notes in electronic health record, to facilitate large-scale studies about associations between suicide and psychiatric stressors.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1460458218796598",""

The closures were complemented by a local ordinance aimed at preventing spatial displacement.

In this paper, we consider a distributed computing algorithmic scheme for stochastic optimization, which relies on modest communication requirements among processors and most importantly, does not require synchronization. Specifically, we analyze a scheme with N > 1 independent threads each implementing a stochastic gradient algorithm. The threads are coupled via a perturbation of the gradient (with attractive and repulsive forces) in a similar manner to mathematical models of flocking, swarming, and other group formations found in nature with mild communication requirements. When the objective function is convex, we show that a flocking-like approach for distributed stochastic optimization provides a noise reduction effect similar to that of a centralized stochastic gradient algorithm based upon the average of N gradient samples at each step. The distributed nature of flocking makes it an appealing computational alternative. We show that when the overhead related to the time needed to gather N samples and synchronization is not negligible, the flocking implementation outperforms a centralized stochastic gradient algorithm based upon the average of N gradient samples at each step. When the objective function is not convex, the flocking-based approach seems better suited to escape locally optimal solutions due to the repulsive force that enforces a certain level of diversity in the set of candidate solutions. Here again, we show that the noise reduction effect is similar to that associated to the centralized stochastic gradient algorithm based upon the average of N gradient samples at each step.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/opre.2017.1666",""

Study design: Retrospective case‐control study. Animals: Dogs (n = 2490) with cranial cruciate ligament rupture that underwent 3000 TPLO surgeries. Methods: Radiographs of 3000 stifles from dogs that underwent TPLO were reviewed for evidence of TTF. Two ratios were generated: (1) the height of the tuberosity over the width of the tibia at the most distal extent of the osteotomy (TW) and (2) the width of the narrowest point of the tuberosity over TW. Results: Twenty‐three (0.77%) cases of fracture were identified. Factors that correlated with increased odds of fracture were placement of antirotational pins distal to the insertion of the patellar ligament (PL), tuberosities with the narrowest point below the insertion of PL, placement of multiple pins distal to the PL, and bilateral simultaneous TPLO. Tuberosities that fractured were significantly taller and narrower than those that did not fracture. Rotation past the “safe point” and presence of a gap at the osteotomy were not correlated with fracture. Conclusion: Placement of multiple pins, pin placement distal to the insertion of the PL, location of the narrowest point of the tibial tuberosity distal to the insertion of the PL, and simultaneous bilateral TPLO were all associated with TTF in this study Clinical significance: Preoperative planning and postoperative assessment of TPLO should take into consideration the predisposing factors identified in this study to prevent TTF.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fvsu.12915",""

There are 10 irrigation technologies that farmers can adopt for cotton production in these 14 cotton-growing states. The intensity of the irrigation technologies, as measured by the number of irrigation technologies adopted in cotton production, is affected by the irrigated cotton yield realized, land holding (total land owned), education, computer use, and the origin of the cotton farmer being from the Southern Plains. We use a multivariate fractional regression model to identify land allocation by the different irrigation technologies used.

We find that some corporate governance features are more important determinants of the form of a firm's exit than many economic factors that have figured prominently in prior research. We also find evidence that outsider‐dominated boards and lower restrictions on internal governance play major roles in the way firms exit public markets, particularly when a firm's industry suffers a negative shock.

After the last day of stress exposure, rats were conditioned in an altitude chamber for 14 days at a 1,000-m simulated altitude for 30 min on day 1 with altitude and duration progressively increasing to 4,000 m for 4 h on day 5. PTSD was associated with decreased time spent in open arms and increased time spent in closed arms of the elevated X-maze, increased anxiety index, and increased rate of freezing responses. Functional and structural signs of adrenal cortex degeneration were also observed, including decreased plasma concentration of corticosterone, decreased weight of adrenal glands, reduced thickness of the fasciculate zone, and hydropic degeneration of adrenal gland cells. The thickness of the adrenal fasciculate zone negatively correlated with the anxiety index. IHC alleviated both behavioral signs of PTSD and morphological evidence of adrenal cortex dystrophy. Also, IHC alone exerted an antistress effect, which was evident from the increased time spent in open arms of the elevated X-maze and a lower number of rats displaying freezing responses. Therefore, IHC of rats with experimental PTSD reduced behavioral signs of the condition and damage to the adrenal glands.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/japplphysiol.01123.2017",""

In this study, we use an exogenous accounting-based shock to debt covenants that relaxed covenant tightness (SFAS 160) and examine whether covenants constrain leverage for borrowers that are close to violation, even when the borrower is financially healthy. We find that SFAS 160 increased debt levels in firms that were close to violation. This increase in debt was driven by financially healthy firms, suggesting the likelihood of future covenant violations could impede borrowing by firms. We also find an increase in investment sensitivity to Q after SFAS 160 in firms close to violation, suggesting the additional debt was used to make legitimate investments. Because SFAS 160 was passed in the midst of the financial crisis, it is difficult to generalize our findings to more normal financial periods.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article-pdf/94/2/133/37617/accr-52204.pdf",""

Wettability not only determines the value of capillary pressure, but, more importantly, it also determines whether the capillary pressure is a driving force or a resistance to fluid flow. This paper is to address the wettability characteristics of shale rocks. First, the common methods to determine wettability are reviewed and discussed for their feasibility for shale rocks. It is found that the real reservoir wettability must be determined in a system with oil and water being present; it cannot be determined by comparing the water and oil‐wetting angles measured on dry rock surfaces. It is also interesting to note that more shale rocks are water wet, although the oil‐wetting angles are smaller than water‐wetting angles on dry rock surfaces. The factors that affect shale wettability are also reviewed.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fapj.2263",""

These challenges render the occasional professional development initiative included in a PLC or TLC event, ineffective where the fragmented, uninteresting, and often poorly planned technology instruction very rarely seems to stick. Drawing on experience with military training and continuing education training, the authors propose a simple, inexpensive, and internally resourced means used by soldiers to train individual and collective military tasks, to assist elementary and secondary teachers to learn how emerging technology works, and more importantly, how to maximize its effective use in the classroom.","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=199434",""

Median time to questionnaire administration from PT surgery was 608 days (64–3,708). Owner satisfaction after PT was high (89.7%), with the majority stating they would have the procedure performed again (79.5%). Owners reported an improvement in their dog's personality (30.8%) and increased activity (41%). Median survival time was 1,825 days (64–2,663), with 6 of 39 dogs (15.4%) alive at study end. Of the 33 dogs who died, 11 (33.3%) died from underlying respiratory conditions suspected to be related to the PT. The overall complication rate was 82.1%, with mucus secretion being the most common. Revision surgery was required in 30.8% of dogs (most commonly due to skin occlusion), and aspiration pneumonia occurred in 17.9% of dogs. Overall, owner satisfaction after PT in dogs is high despite intensive postoperative management, and long survival times can be achieved.","http://meridian.allenpress.com/jaaha/article-pdf/54/5/285/1590283/jaaha-ms-6738.pdf",""

Methods:: A review was performed of 119 consecutive patients undergoing autologous fat grafting for oncologic head and neck reconstruction from 2005 to 2014. Aesthetic outcomes were rated by a group of 10 plastic surgeons and 10 laypersons using a five-point Likert scale. Results:: A total of 190 fat grafting procedures were performed in 116 patients. Of these, 69 percent had received radiation therapy before their reconstructive surgery. The average number of treatments per patient was 1.6 ± 1 (range, 1 to 6), with a mean injection volume of 24.8 ± 20.2 ml. The mean follow-up time from the first fat grafting procedure was 35.8 ± 23.1 months. Complications occurred in 6 percent, none of which required a return to the operating room or hospital admission. Oncologic recurrence was observed in six patients (three local, one regional, and two distant). Locoregional recurrences were in areas outside of where the fat was grafted. Aesthetic analysis revealed that both plastic surgeons and laypersons thought patients appeared closer to normal following autologous fat grafting. Conclusion:: This study suggests that autologous fat grafting plays a valuable role in enhancing aesthetic outcomes either by complementing or replacing reconstructive flaps for oncologic head and neck reconstruction while having both low complication rates and no evidence of being associated with cancer recurrence.","https://journals.lww.com/00006534-201809000-00037",""

Moreover, like other aspects of the marital-health link, healthcare work dynamics likely vary by gender and couple type. To explore this possibility, we use in-depth interviews with 90 midlife gay, lesbian, and heterosexual spouses to examine how spouses perform healthcare work. Our results show that in heterosexual marriage, women perform the bulk of healthcare work and typically do so in coercive ways. A minority of heterosexual men provide instrumental healthcare work for their wives. Gay and lesbian spouses appear to commonly use both coercive and supportive healthcare work strategies to effectively promote healthcare use. Our findings demonstrate the ways spouses are central to supporting and coercing one another to obtain medical care and how these patterns are gendered.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0022146518808718",""

While many researchers have explored identity transitions of teacher educators, more research is needed to understand this experience with music teacher educators. Using self-study, we explored our identities as four music teacher educators, plus one additional participant, in transitioning from being music teachers to early-career music teacher educators. Data included interviews and personal journals, and we developed restoried narratives, non-linear representations, and cartoons during data analysis. These revealed three themes: misalignment, adaptation and acceptance, and roller coaster of growth. Misalignment describes the disconnect we experienced between our substantial and situational selves as a result of three factors: balance, autonomy, and identity. Adaptation and acceptance describes the strategies we developed to respond to the factors leading to our misalignment and accept our developing identities as music teacher educators. Roller coaster of growth describes the indirect nature of the process we experienced as we shifted between misalignment and acceptance. Based on these findings, we suggest further research in the identities of teacher educators throughout their careers and recommend strategies for professional development and support.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1321103X18773114",""

(switchgrass) cultivars (‘Alamo’, ‘Cimarron’, ‘Kanlow’, ‘NL 94C2-3’, ‘NSL 2009-1’, and ‘NSL 2009-2’) were evaluated for salt tolerance in two separate greenhouse experiments. In experiment (Expt.) 1, switchgrass seedlings were irrigated with a nutrient solution at an electrical conductivity (EC) of 1.2 dS·m−1 (control) or a saline solution (spiked with salts) at an EC of 5.0 dS·m−1 (EC 5) or 10.0 dS·m−1 (EC 10) for four weeks, once a week. Treatment EC 10 reduced the tiller number by 32% to 37% for all switchgrass cultivars except ‘Kanlow’. All switchgrass cultivars under EC 10 had a significant reduction of 50% to 63% in dry weight. In Expt. 2, switchgrass was seeded in substrates moistened with either a nutrient solution of EC 1.2 dS·m−1 (control) or a saline solution of EC of 5.0, 10.0, or 20.0 dS·m−1 (EC 5, EC 10, or EC 20). Treatment EC 5 did not affect the seedling emergence, regardless of cultivar. Compared to the control, EC 10 reduced the seedling emergence of switchgrass ‘Alamo’, ‘Cimarron’, and ‘NL 94C2-3’ by 44%, 33%, and 82%, respectively. All switchgrass cultivars under EC 10 had a 46% to 88% reduction in the seedling emergence index except ‘NSL 2009-2’. No switchgrass seedlings emerged under EC 20. In summary, high salinity negatively affected switchgrass seedling emergence and growth. Dendrogram and cluster of six switchgrass cultivars indicated that ‘Alamo’ was the most tolerant cultivar, while ‘NSL 2009-2’ was the least tolerant cultivar at both seedling emergence and growth stages. A growth-stage dependent response to salinity was observed for the remaining switchgrass cultivars. ‘NSL 2009-1’ and ‘NL 94C2-3’ were more tolerant to salinity than ‘Cimarron’ and ‘Kanlow’ at the seedling emergence stage; however, ‘Kanlow’ and ‘Cimarron’ were more tolerant to salinity than ‘NSL 2009-1’ and ‘NL 94C2-3’ at the seedling growth stage.","https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/8/5/66/pdf",""

Recent studies have shown alarming evidence that the United States leads developed nations in terms of shorter hospital stays, rendering patients with greater risk of future readmissions. We focus on deviation between hospital LOS and the geometric mean LOS (GMLOS), a guideline for care delivery stipulated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Our objective is to establish the relationship between LOS and readmission risk, examine the role of health IT in reducing the deviation of LOS, and address cost trade‐offs between early discharges and readmissions. Based on a large panel of congestive heart failure (CHF) patients during a 4‐year period, we find that implementation of health IT applications is associated with a reduction in the deviation between LOS and GMLOS. This deviation is associated with a significant increase in future 30‐day readmission risk. Patients whose inpatient stays are shorter than the GMLOS guideline, by 1 day or more, are likely to exhibit a 1.1% greater risk of readmission, and even shorter stays are likely to further exacerbate their readmission risk. Further, we find that the total readmission costs are much higher than the costs incurred in keeping patients longer during their initial hospital visit. Our results have important policy implications for providers and hospital administrators with respect to their discharge policies of CHF patients.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fpoms.12748",""

We propose that the post–1.0 Ga increase in juvenile magmatism reflects a switch to lateral arc terrane accretion as the primary style of continental growth over the past billion years.","https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-pdf/46/3/275/6259179/275.pdf",""

Cooked steaks were used to evaluate internal and external color, Warner-Bratzler and slice shear force, total collagen content, protein denaturation, and trained sensory ratings. Relative humidity greatly reduced cooking rate, especially at 80°C. Steaks cooked at 80°C-ZH had the greatest (P < 0.01) cook loss of all treatments, and cook loss was not affected (P > 0.05). Steaks cooked at 80°C-ZH appeared the most (P < 0.01) well-done and had the darkest (P > 0.01) surface color. Total collagen was greatest (P < 0.01) in steaks cooked with ZH, regardless of oven temperature. Myosin denaturation was not affected (P > 0.05) by treatment.

Data from 11 previously conducted studies representing a wide range of treatments and levels of eating quality that included more than 1,500 beef samples and 1,800 consumers were compiled and analyzed for this study. Results of a multivariate regression indicated that tenderness, flavor, and juiciness accounted for 43.4%, 49.4%, and 7.4%, respectively, of overall palatability (P &lt; 0.05; R2 &gt; 0.99). Additionally, the odds of a steak being rated unacceptable overall when tenderness, juiciness, or flavor were rated unacceptable were 2.2 to 1 (69%), 1.9 to 1 (66%), and 3.3 to 1 (77%), respectively. This indicated overall palatability was 7.2, 6.5, and 12.3 times more likely to be rated unacceptable if tenderness, juiciness, or flavor, respectively, was also rated unacceptable. Additionally, the percentage of samples rated acceptable for each palatability trait increased (P &lt; 0.05) as quality grade increased. More than 88% of USDA Prime samples were rated acceptable for each palatability trait, whereas only 74.8–77.3% of USDA Select samples were rated acceptable for each palatability trait. Marbling score accounted for 14–16% of the variation (P &lt; 0.01) in consumer palatability scores for each trait and intramuscular fat percentage accounted for 17–21% of the variation in each trait (P &lt; 0.01). Logistic equation models for the predicted probability of an acceptable rating for each palatability trait based on intramuscular fat percentage accounted for only a minimal amount of variation (P &lt; 0.01; R2 ≤ 0.09). Results of this study indicate the relative contribution of tenderness, juiciness, and flavor to overall beef palatability. They provide evidence that the failure of even a single palatability trait dramatically increases the likelihood of overall palatability failure, indicating that no single palatability trait is most important, as beef palatability is dependent upon the acceptance of all three traits: tenderness, juiciness, and flavor.","http://academic.oup.com/tas/article-pdf/2/1/26/33234295/txx008.pdf",""

Limitations of visual monitoring of cattle behavior include training of personnel, subjectivity, and brevity. In addition, extensive time and labor is required to visually monitor behavior in large numbers of animals, and the prey instinct of cattle to disguise abnormal behaviors in the presence of a human evaluator is problematic. More recently, cattle behavior has been quantified objectively and continuously using advanced technologies to assess animal welfare, indicate lameness or disease, and detect estrus in both production and research settings. The current review will summarize three methodologies for quantification of cattle behavior with focus on U.S. beef production systems; 1) three-axis accelerometers that quantify physical behavior, 2) systems that document feeding and watering behavior via radio frequency, and 3) triangulation or global positioning systems to determine location and movement of cattle within a pen or pasture. Furthermore, advances in Wi-Fi and radio frequency technology have allowed many of these systems to operate remotely and in real-time and efforts are underway to develop commercial applications that may allow early detection of respiratory or other cattle diseases in the production environment. Current challenges with commercial application of technology for early disease detection include establishment of an appropriate algorithm to ensure maximum sensitivity and specificity, reliable and repeatable data collection in harsh environments, cost:benefit, and integration with traditional methodology for clinical diagnosis. Advanced technologies have also allowed cattle researchers to determine temporal variance in behavior or variability between experimental treatments. However, these data sets are typically very large and challenges exist regarding statistical analysis and reporting.","http://academic.oup.com/tas/article-pdf/2/2/223/33233743/txy004.pdf",""

The National Birth Defects Prevention Network (NBDPN) assessed BDS program activities in the United States before and after the Zika response. Methods: The NBDPN surveyed 54 BDS programs regarding activities before and after the Zika response, lessons learned, and programmatic needs. Follow‐up emails were sent and phone calls were held for programs with incomplete or no response to the online survey. Survey data were cleaned and tallied, and responses to open‐ended questions were placed into best‐fit categories. Results: A 100% response rate was achieved. Of the 54 programs surveyed, 42 reported participation in the Zika public health response that included BDS activities. Programs faced challenges in expanding their surveillance effort given the response requirements but reported mitigating factors such as establishing and enhancing partnerships and program experience with surveillance and clinical activities. Beyond funding, reported program needs included training, surveillance tools/resources, and availability of clinical experts. Conclusions: Existing BDS programs with experience implementing active case‐finding and case verification were able to adapt their surveillance efforts rapidly to collect and report data necessary for the Zika response. Program sustainability for BDS remains challenging; thus, continued support, training, and resource development are important to ensure that the infrastructure built during the Zika response is available for the next public health response.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fbdr2.1391",""

The water level measurements from the Iowa Flood Inundation System (a test bed sensor network in this study) were converted to water depths and then assimilated into the HAND model using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). The results showed that after assimilating the water depth using the EnKF, for a flood event during 2015, the normalized root mean square error was reduced by 0.50 m (51%) for training tributaries. Comparison of the updated modeled water stage values with observations at testing locations showed that the proposed methodology was also effective on the tributaries with no observations. The overall error reduced from 0.89 m to 0.44 m for testing tributaries. The updated depths were then converted to streamflow using rating curves generated by the HAND model.

The model is based on two dimensions: (1) the direction of the political strategy (upward or downward) and (2) the scope of the political strategy (individual or group based). The model assumes that the interaction between these dimensions will define four different types of e-learning political strategies, which, in turn, will lead to different outcomes. The model is presented in the context of the literature on e-learning and is accompanied with four short case studies that demonstrate its political strategies. The discussion and conclusions section integrates the findings from the case studies and outlines the rules that govern the utilization of political e-learning strategies in different organizational contexts.","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=203930",""

Extended reformulations of FWI avoid cycle skipping through adding auxiliary parameters to the model so that a good data fit can be maintained throughout the inversion process. The volume-based matched source waveform inversion algorithm introduces source parameters by relaxing the location constraint of source energy: It is permitted to spread in space, while being strictly localized at time [Formula: see text]. The extent of source energy spread is penalized by weighting the source energy with distance from the survey source location. For transmission data geometry (crosswell, diving wave, etc.) and transparent (nonreflecting) acoustic models, this penalty function is stable with respect to the data-frequency content, unlike the standard FWI objective. We conjecture that the penalty function is actually convex over much larger region in model space than is the FWI objective. Several synthetic examples support this conjecture and suggest that the theoretical limitation to pure transmission is not necessary: The inversion method can converge to a solution of the inverse problem in the absence of low-frequency data from an inaccurate initial velocity model even when reflections and refractions are present in the data along with transmitted energy.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/geo2017-0330.1",""

In the Americas, Sabethes species are vectors of sylvatic yellow fever virus (YFV) and are therefore candidate vectors of a sylvatic ZIKV cycle. To test the potential of Sabethes cyaneus to transmit ZIKV, Sa. cyaneus and Ae. aegypti were fed on A129 mice one or two days post-infection (dpi) with a ZIKV isolate from Mexico. Sa. cyaneus were sampled at 3, 4, 5, 7, 14, and 21 days post-feeding (dpf) and Ae. aegypti were sampled at 14 and 21 dpf. ZIKV was quantified in mosquito bodies, legs, and saliva to measure infection, dissemination, and potential transmission, respectively. Of 69 Sa. cyaneus that fed, ZIKV was detected in only one, in all body compartments, at 21 dpf. In contrast, at 14 dpf 100% of 20 Ae. aegypti that fed on mice at 2 dpi were infected and 70% had virus in saliva.

Accurate assessment of HMB, a key component in the diagnosis of a haemostatic defect (HD), is a well‐recognized challenge. Aim: Our objective was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of an HMB‐specific screening tool for HDs in adolescents with HMB, presenting to a secondary care setting. Methods: Adolescents with HMB were evaluated for a HD at 4 US centres. A screening tool, the Philipp Tool, developed and validated in adult women with HMB, was administered. We modified the tool by assigning a score based on the number of affirmative responses. Sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios (LRs) of a positive tool, modified tool, with a pictorial blood assessment chart (PBAC) score >185, and with serum ferritin ≤20 ng/mL were calculated for HDs. Results: Among 248 adolescents with HMB, 29% were diagnosed with HDs. Sensitivity, specificity and LR of a positive screening tool for HDs were 95% (range 88‐99), 14% (9‐21) and 1.1 (1‐1.2), respectively. A score of ≥2, addition of a PBAC score >185 and ferritin ≤20 ng/mL changed the sensitivity, specificity and LR of the tool to 72% (61‐81), 94% (83‐99), 76% (65‐85); 60% (53‐68), 24% (16‐34) and 39% (31‐47) and 1.8 (1.4‐2.2), 1.2 (1.1‐1.4) and 1.2 (1‐1.4), respectively. Conclusion: Although sensitive, the discriminative ability of the tool to identify adolescents with HDs from those without, who presented with HMB, was low. Further research is needed to optimize or develop an adolescent‐specific HMB tool for secondary care settings.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fhae.13609",""

To investigate this and understand the experience of undocumented parenting, the authors interviewed 70 undocumented parents in two Southwest cities from 2012 to 2013. The authors frame their analysis using the lens of the problem of “illegality.” There are three domains of stressors associated with parenting in the context of deportation risk: trapped parenting, threat of family separation, and altered family processes.

Paleoaltimetry data suggest that the hinterland plateau in southern Bolivia underwent rapid surface uplift at ~16–9 Ma, which is predicted to have induced rapid thrust belt propagation. We integrate fission track and (U‐Th)/He ages from zircon and apatite with a sequentially restored cross section to quantify the timing and rates of thrust belt propagation in southern Bolivia for the last ~43 Myr. These data show that retroarc shortening in the Eastern Cordillera propagated westward from ~43 to 27 Ma as the wedge grew to attain critical taper and steady state. The thrust front then advanced rapidly eastward from ~25 to 17 Ma across the western Interandean zone, where a weak decollement modified the critical taper angle. The thrust front stalled for ~6 Myr but resumed eastward advance into the eastern Interandean zone and Subandean zone by ~11–8 Ma, which we interpret as a response to increased accretionary influx and rapid orogenic wedge expansion induced by eclogitic delamination and corresponding hinterland surface uplift at ~13 Ma. Development of an orographic barrier and wetter climatic conditions resulted in relatively steady state wedge conditions from ~8.5 to 1.5 Ma. Rapid wedge growth after ~1.5 Ma may be attributed to mass accumulation in the orogen interior or a weakened decollement. Our data reveal space‐time variations in orogenic wedge evolution consistent with models of Cordilleran cyclicity and lithospheric removal, with important additional influences of erosion, climate, and rock rheology.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2018TC005132",""

Guided by the scholarship on protest coverage, this article investigates the interplay between advocacy and journalistic framing in the coverage of the Ferguson protests by national and local news. A content analysis of five newspapers during the first cycle of protests identified how journalistic frames of presentation derived from the ‘protest paradigm’ literature related to the content frames pushed forward by the Black Lives Matter movement. Results reveal that initial stories were predominantly episodic and focused on violence to the detriment of demands and grievances. However, episodic stories were also critical of the police response and the use of military-grade weapons to contain the demonstrations. As the weeks progressed, journalists gave space to the ideas of protestors in a more thematic way, especially on issues related to race beyond the topic of police brutality. Taken together, findings suggest small but significant progress as time continued during the first month of demonstrations after Brown’s shooting. Results presented here challenge the paradigmatic nature of protest coverage but reinforce that more space should be given to contextual narratives behind social movements’ actions in addition to coverage that is critical of police and protestor tactics.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1464884918778722",""

Second, we sought to explore whether narrative receptive and expressive performance in bilingual children's L2 differed based on the type of contextual support. Method: In a longitudinal group study, 20 Spanish–English bilingual children with PLI were matched by sex, age, nonverbal IQ score, and language exposure to 20 bilingual peers with typical development and administered the Test of Narrative Language (Gillam & Pearson, 2004) in English (their L2) at kindergarten and first grade. Results: Standard scores were significantly lower for bilingual children with PLI than those without PLI. An L2 receptive–expressive gap existed for bilingual children with PLI at kindergarten but dissipated by first grade. Using single pictures during narrative generation compared to multiple pictures during narrative generation or no pictures during narrative retell appeared to minimize the presence of a receptive–expressive gap. Conclusions: In early stages of L2 learning, bilingual children with PLI have an L2 receptive–expressive gap, but their typical development peers do not. Using a single picture during narrative generation might be advantageous for this population because it minimizes a receptive–expressive gap.","http://pubs.asha.org/doi/pdf/10.1044/2018_JSLHR-L-16-0432",""

Consequently, invasive species biology has emerged as an important subdiscipline of conservation biology. One of the goals of invasive species biology is to educate the public about impacts and potential control of invasive species. The purpose of this study was to determine if a lecture, a lecture and laboratory learning model, or both influence college student learning gains and whether increase in knowledge results in changes in attitudes about invasive species. A pre- and posttest instrument that measured knowledge and attitudes of invasive species was administered to several different classes of students at a university and community college. One group of students received a lecture and laboratory curriculum between the pre- and posttest (the lecture and laboratory treatment group). A second group of students received a lecture between the pre- and posttest (the lecture-only treatment group) and a third group received no instruction between tests (the control group). The lecture was in the form of an electronic presentation, whereas the laboratory curriculum included a case study, a visual aid, and a scavenger hunt to educate students about examples of invasive plant and animal species. In all classes and groups, there were at least 2 weeks between administering the pre- and posttest. Results showed that the control group scores were not different between the pre- and posttest. However, both the lecture-only and the lecture and laboratory treatment groups had scores that changed after receiving the curricula. In addition, there was an effect of curricula on student learning for the three conditions. The differences between the group that received no curricula vs. the two that did indicated that the curricula were effective teaching interventions to help students become more educated about invasive species.","https://journals.ashs.org/downloadpdf/journals/horttech/28/4/article-p548.xml",""

There are differences in the source and amount of start-up funds, gender, and the sector of the business. The differences depend on the group to which Latinos are being compared; for example, manufacturing firms are less likely to be Latino owned than White owned, but more likely to be Latino owned than Black owned. An exception is college education and rurality; Latino owners are consistently less likely to be college educated and more likely to locate in rural areas than the other ethnic minorities.

Indeed, press accounts and other case or conceptual urban studies research emphasizing the downside of these transactions are some of the only sources of information on these instruments. These stories and studies often allude to or speculate on a more basic question: Why would a government choose to enter into a complex financial instrument like a debt-related derivative? This research posits three exploratory hypotheses—financial health, financial experience and/or financial sector influence, and governance structure—culled from media accounts and the urban studies literature on the use of debt-related derivatives by city governments in the United States. It empirically explores these hypotheses by examining the various fiscal, financial, and issuer characteristics of the largest 50 U.S. cities and their choice of whether to use debt-related derivatives. The research finds that the characteristics of government most associated with debt-related derivative use are declining financial condition, increased financial experience and/or financial sector influence, and prior use of interest rate swaps.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1078087418802360",""

This study explains the process through which i-deals lead to positive employee outcomes in the form of increased employee job satisfaction, organizational citizenship behavior, job performance, and reduced employee turnover. We hypothesized that employees’ perceived organizational support (POS), quality of relationship with the supervisor known as leader–member exchange (LMX), and quality of the relationship with the supervisor in comparison to others in the group termed as leader–member exchange social comparison (LMXSC) mediates the relationships between i-deals to outcomes. In a sample of 338 faculty employees nested in 49 departments from a private university, we found support for direct relationships between i-deals, outcomes, and mediators (POS, LMX, and LMXSC).

One survey consisted of demographic and PAF knowledge questions for middle school students, and the other survey included the Attitude Toward Physical Education Questionnaire and the Youth Activity Profile. Structural equation models showed that perceived enjoyment and perceived usefulness, as affective and cognitive dimensions of attitude toward PE respectively, demonstrated small effects on physical activity and sedentary behavior, while perceived enjoyment further showed a moderate effect on PAF knowledge, after controlling for gender and grade.

Materials and methods: In order to assess the differential contributions of diet and surgery to the mechanisms leading to the rapid improvement in diabetes after RYGB we enrolled 10 patients with type 2 diabetes scheduled to undergo RYGB. All patients underwent a 10‐day inpatient supervised dietary intervention equivalent to the peri‐operative diet (diet‐only period), followed by, after a re‐equilibration (washout) period, an identical period of pair‐matched diet in conjunction with RYGB (diet and RYGB period). We conducted extensive metabolic assessments during a 6‐hour mixed‐meal challenge test, with stable isotope glucose tracer infusion performed before and after each intervention. Results: Similar improvements in glucose levels, β‐cell function, insulin sensitivity and post‐meal hepatic insulin resistance were observed with both interventions. Both interventions led to significant reductions in fasting and postprandial acyl ghrelin. The diet‐only intervention induced greater improvements in basal hepatic glucose output and post‐meal gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) secretion. The diet and RYGB intervention induced significantly greater increases in post‐meal glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1), peptide YY (PYY) and glucagon levels. Conclusions: Strict peri‐operative dietary restriction is a main contributor to the rapid improvement in glucose metabolism after RYGB. The RYGB‐induced changes in the incretin hormones GLP‐1 and PYY probably play a major role in long‐term compliance with such major dietary restrictions through central and peripheral mechanisms.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fdom.13287",""

Termed cognitive set, this failure to switch from a familiar strategy to a better alternative has been considered universally human. Yet, our understanding of this phenomenon is derived almost exclusively from Western subjects. In this study, we used the nonverbal Learned Strategy–Direct Strategy (LS-DS) touchscreen task in which subjects are presented with an opportunity to use either a learned strategy or a more efficient, but novel, shortcut. We found that the remote, seminomadic Himba of northern Namibia exhibited enhanced shortcut-use on the LS-DS task, challenging the claim that cognitive set affects humans universally. In addition, we found that altering subjects’ conceptualization of the shortcut as a viable option significantly enhanced its subsequent use in Western but not Himba participants. We discuss how other aspects of cultural variation, namely, environmental uncertainty and educational background, might contribute to the observed cross-cultural differences in flexible strategy-use.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0022022118806581",""

We evaluated the impact of a social change intervention on health care personnel (HCP), called “positive deviance” (PD), on patient safety culture related to infection prevention among HCP. Methods: This observational study was done in 6 medical wards at an 800-bed public academic hospital in the United States. Three of these wards were randomly assigned to receive PD intervention on HCP. After a retrospective 6-month baseline period, PD was implemented over 9 months, followed by 9 months of follow-up. Patient safety culture and social networks among HCP were surveyed at 6, 15, and 24 months. Rates of HAI were measured among patients. Results: The measured patient safety culture was steady over time at 69% aggregate percent positive responses in wards with PD vs decline from 79% to 75% in wards without PD (F statistic 10.55; P = .005). Social network maps suggested that nurses, charge nurses, medical assistants, ward managers, and ward clerks play a key role in preventing infections. Fitted time series of monthly HAI rates showed a decrease from 4.8 to 2.8 per 1000 patient-days (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1 to 3.5) in wards without PD, and 5.0 to 2.1 per 1000 patient-days (95% CI, –0.4 to 4.5) in wards with PD. Conclusions: A positive deviance approach appeared to have a significant impact on patient safety culture among HCP who received the intervention. Social network analysis identified HCP who are likely to help disseminate infection prevention information. Systemwide interventions independent of PD resulted in HAI reduction in both intervention and control wards.","http://academic.oup.com/ofid/article-pdf/5/10/ofy231/33578145/ofy231.pdf",""

This is generally referred to as “erosion.” Empirical and computational studies have been conducted to quantify the effect of magnetopause erosion; however, they generally use steady state IMF conditions. Solar wind conditions are not usually constant for very long, especially during such conditions as are present in high‐speed streams, which typically have large fluctuations in the IMF. These IMF fluctuations can occur on a range of times scales and amplitudes, resulting in a series of northward and southward IMF intervals imposed on the magnetosphere. We have simulated the effect of such IMF variations on the magnetopause position using a global magnetohydrodynamic model. We find that there are both time lag and hysteresis‐like effects on the motion of the magnetopause due to the variation in the magnitude of the southward IMF and that the instantaneous position of the magnetopause can be significantly different from what one would expect from steady state conditions.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2F2018JA025203",""

Racial threat has been proffered as a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon. In an effort to understand the factors that influence punishment and racial divides in America, we draw on racial threat theory and prior scholarship to test three hypotheses. First, Black punitive sentiment among Whites will be greater among those who reside in areas where lynching was more common. Second, heightened Black punitive sentiment among Whites in areas with more pronounced legacies of lynching will be partially mediated by Whites’ perceptions of Blacks’ criminality and of Black‐on‐White violence in these areas. Third, the impact of lynching on Black punitive sentiment will be amplified by Whites’ perceptions of Blacks as criminals and as threatening more generally. We find partial support for these hypotheses. The results indicate that lynchings are associated with punitive sentiment toward Black offenders, and these relationships are partially mediated by perceptions of Blacks as criminals and as threats to Whites. In addition, the effects of lynchings on Black punitiveness are amplified among White respondents who view Blacks as a threat to Whites. These results highlight the salience of historical context for understanding contemporary views about punishment.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2F1745-9125.12176",""

This raises the question of how to align the environmental benefits with commercial motivations to drive more widespread implementation. Here, we examine the role that government policy can play in accelerating production and use at commercial scale. We identify three types of programs that can support biochar production: commercial financial incentives, nonfinancial policy support, and research and development funding. We also describe how these programs are currently used to support biochar production. For example, financial incentives can motivate immediate changes in business practices while nonfinancial policies can be important mechanisms to educate consumers and expand market demand. Research and development support can provide the necessary funding for early‐stage innovations that may one day become commercially viable options, even without other types of policy support. There are different risk–reward profiles for each policy mechanism, and these must be considered when evaluating a policy direction. Finally, we offer broad recommendations to the development of policy that maximizes the net benefits of biochar adoption. Key recommendations include improving policies that allow for the monetization of environmental benefits and avoided costs, recognizing soil as a resource through national preservation policy, and developing a broadly accepted set of product standards for biochar.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fgcbb.12582",""

Methods: Drawing on a battery of questions in the 2014 Cooperative Congressional Election Study, we explore why some respondents believe these laws prevent fraud while others believe they disadvantage political participation. Results: We find that partisanship shapes respondents’ attitudes about the effects of voter ID laws, but in different ways. Democrats, whose opinions vary according to ideology, education, attention to politics, and racial resentment, are divided. Republicans, however, are markedly more united in their support of voter ID laws. Conclusions: These differences, we argue, are consistent with an elite‐to‐mass message transmission reflecting the current context of polarized party politics and the variation in the voter coalitions comprising the Democratic and Republican parties.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fssqu.12541",""

Replacing the attenuated true gradient with a [Formula: see text]-compensated gradient can accelerate the convergence rate of the inversion process. We have used a phase-dispersion and an amplitude-loss decoupled constant-[Formula: see text] wave equation to formulate a viscoacoustic FWI.

We construct an exact adjoint operator in a discretized form using the low-rank wave extrapolation technique, and we implement the gradient compensation by reversing the sign of the amplitude-loss term in the forward and adjoint operators. This leads to a [Formula: see text]-dependent gradient preconditioning method.

Additionally, we demonstrated three consequences of possessing and activating a Women–Birds association. For those who strongly associated women and birds, activating the association caused an increase in dehumanization of women, perceptions of female incompetence, and sexist hiring decisions. Perceptions of female incompetence mediated the effect of Women–Birds implicit association activation on sexist hiring decisions.

However, rock-property models must consider the dual-porosity structure of pyroclastic deposits (i.e., vesicles within pumices and intergranular pores). Vesicularity, intergranular porosity, and water saturation all affect the density, elasticity, and dielectric properties of pyroclastic materials, which control seismic and electromagnetic velocities. The data from active seismic and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) techniques may improve porosity and water saturation estimation if the responses of seismic and electromagnetic velocities to porosity and water saturation variations are complementary in pyroclastic deposits. We developed a dual-porosity petrophysical model to calculate seismic and electromagnetic velocities of pyroclastic deposits with known intergranular porosity, vesicularity, and water saturation, and we tested our ability to estimate porosity and water saturation from field measurements of seismic and electromagnetic velocities in pyroclastic deposits at Mount St. Helens, Washington, USA. Our petrophysical model demonstrates that seismic velocities are more sensitive to intergranular porosity and less sensitive to vesicularity; electromagnetic velocity is primarily controlled by volumetric water content. In a multioffset GPR and active seismic case study, seismic first-arrival traveltime tomography and multichannel analysis of surface waves can resolve high-velocity anomalies caused by porosity reduction. Joint petrophysical inversion of electromagnetic and seismic velocities indicates that although intergranular porosity and water saturation are well-constrained (i.e., standard deviations of approximately 0.05), quantitative estimates of vesicularity remain less certain (i.e., standard deviation of approximately 0.21), due to weak sensitivity.","https://library.seg.org/doi/am-pdf/10.1190/geo2017-0234.1",""

Results of both experiments show that, compared with two equivalent quota systems, sales employees’ performance increased substantially under the self-selected incentive scheme. In addition, findings reveal that the performance increase induced by this scheme is substantially greater for sales employees with a high variation in past performance and for employees with a low past-performance level. Moreover, the authors find that the effects of the self-selected incentive scheme not only are durable when offered again but also persist after the scheme is discontinued.

Because multiple tissues are affected by systemic alterations in insulin signaling, the functional locus of insulin signaling in diabetes-associated hypersensitivity remains obscure. Here, we used Drosophila nociception/nociceptive sensitization assays to investigate the role of Insulin receptor (Insulin-like receptor, InR) in nociceptive hypersensitivity. InR mutant larvae exhibited mostly normal baseline thermal nociception (absence of injury) and normal acute thermal hypersensitivity following UV-induced injury. However, their acute thermal hypersensitivity persists and fails to return to baseline, unlike in controls. Remarkably, injury-induced persistent hypersensitivity is also observed in larvae that exhibit either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Cell type-specific genetic analysis indicates that InR function is required in multidendritic sensory neurons including nociceptive class IV neurons. In these same nociceptive sensory neurons, only modest changes in dendritic morphology were observed in the InRRNAi-expressing and diabetic larvae. At the cellular level, InR-deficient nociceptive sensory neurons show elevated calcium responses after injury. Sensory neuron-specific expression of InR rescues the persistent thermal hypersensitivity of InR mutants and constitutive activation of InR in sensory neurons ameliorates the hypersensitivity observed with a type 2-like diabetic state. Our results suggest that a sensory neuron-specific function of InR regulates the persistence of injury-associated hypersensitivity. It is likely that this new system will be an informative genetically tractable model of diabetes-associated hypersensitivity.","http://journals.biologists.com/dmm/article-pdf/doi/10.1242/dmm.034231/1862022/dmm034231.pdf",""

We consider three control objectives: (1) minimizing the queueing (and idleness) cost, (2) minimizing the queueing cost while imposing a constraint on idleness at each server pool, and (3) minimizing the queueing cost while requiring fairness on idleness. The running costs can be any nonnegative convex functions having at most polynomial growth. For all three problems, we establish asymptotic optimality; namely, the convergence of the value functions of the diffusion-scaled state process to the corresponding values of the controlled diffusion limit. We also present a simple state-dependent priority scheduling policy under which the diffusion-scaled state process is geometrically ergodic in the Halfin–Whitt regime, and some results on convergence of mean empirical measures, which facilitate the proofs.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/moor.2017.0886",""

Several numerical examples illustrate the accuracy and robustness of the method. These examples include verification of convergence rates by manufactured solutions, common one‐dimensional benchmarks, and realistic discontinuous permeability fields.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fnme.5919",""

Areas that are more vulnerable to such changes are semiarid river systems or regions experiencing intermittent flow and cyclic droughts. Although ecological changes are expected to occur with flow regime alterations, the biological changes cannot be predicted until the flow in such regions is analysed. This study addresses this concern by providing an analysis of flow for a semiarid river basin in the Central Great Plains from a 50 and 100‐year projection climate data. The projected data for these two periods are then compared with 30‐year historical data to determine changes in flow. Five major components of flow regime, magnitude, duration, and timing of annual extreme water conditions, frequency and duration of high and low pulses, and rate and frequency of water condition changes, were examined with respect to climate change for their impact on the ecology of the basin. This analysis strongly suggests that inter‐ and intra‐annual changes in flow regimes will result in the intensified drying of the basin represented by the increased number of low flow periods followed by higher occurrences of high flow events of shorter duration with expected changes in climate.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Frra.3249",""

Exosome membrane factors and contents have been reported to alter adjacent and distant cell behavior in multiple studies, but the impact of cancer-derived exosomes on chemoresistance is less clear. We therefore analyzed exosomes from the human pancreatic cancer (PC) cell lines PANC-1, MIA PaCa-2 and BxPC-3 for their ability to transmit chemoresistance, finding that PANC-1 exosomes increased the gembicitabine (GEM) resistance of MIA PaCa-2 and BxPC-3 cell cultures. Comparative proteomics determined that PANC-1 exosomes overexpressed Ephrin type-A receptor 2 (EphA2) versus exosomes of less chemoresistant PC cell lines MIA PaCa-2 and BxPC-3. EphA2-knockdown in PANC-1 cells inhibited their ability to transmit exosome-mediated chemoresistance to MIA PaCa-2 and BxPC-3, while treatment of MIA PaCa-2 and BxPC-3 cells with soluble EphA2 did not promote chemoresistance, indicating that membrane carried EphA2 was important for the EphA2 chemoresistance effect. EphA2 levels on circulating exosomes were markedly increased in mice bearing PANC-1 tumors and PC patients who subsequently revealed poor responses to treatment. We thus concluded that exosomal EphA2 expression could transmit chemoresistance and may serve as a minimally-invasive predictive biomarker for PC treatment response. Further work should address whether additional exosomal factors regulate resistance to other cancer therapeutic agents for PC or other cancer types.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/78/13_Supplement/585/630417/Abstract-585-Exosomal-EphA2-transmits",""

The diversity of functional roles played by electrical synapses is perhaps best exemplified in the vertebrate retina, in which gap junctions are expressed by each of the five major neuronal types. These junctions are highly plastic; they are dynamically regulated by ambient illumination and circadian rhythms acting through light-activated neuromodulators. The networks formed by electrically coupled neurons provide plastic, reconfigurable circuits positioned to play key and diverse roles in the transmission and processing of visual information at every retinal level. Recent work indicates gap junctions also play a role in the progressive cell death and aberrant activity seen in various pathological conditions of the retina. Gap junctions thus form potential targets for novel neuroprotective therapies in the treatment of neurodegenerative retinal diseases such as glaucoma and ischemic retinopathies.","https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-vision-091517-034133",""

Students, therefore, must understand the scientific criteria for evaluating the quality of argumentative structures and interactions. Yet, a question remains as to how students' knowledge about a science concept influences their ability to productively engage in argumentative discourse about a topic. This study explored several hypotheses related to the interaction between the depth of students' familiarity with content involved in an argumentative interaction and their understanding of the scientific practice itself. Multiple triads of students completed a set of two argumentation tasks at two times during the year, in between which students had the opportunity to learn about scientific argumentation and one of the two chemistry concepts focused on in the tasks. Video records of the students' discussions were analyzed to determine the quality of their argumentation. The results indicate that a positive relationship does exist between content familiarity and high quality argumentation, especially as it relates to students epistemic and social interactions. Additional analyses suggest that students can also take up and use epistemic characteristics of scientific argumentation in contexts where the science content is unfamiliar. Further results and their implications are discussed.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Ftea.21451",""
