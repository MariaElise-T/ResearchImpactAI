In this work, resists based on a conformationally immobile calix[6]arene molecule were synthesized and their sensitivities measured while the number of attached functional groups was systematically varied. This provided a direct test of the effect of the degree of functionalization on the electron beam resist sensitivity. The synthesis produced two basic molecular conformations: a cone conformer and a 1,2,3-alternate conformer. The number of attached allyl groups was deliberately varied from 0 to 8 allyls in steps of 2 allyls per synthesis. The resulting nine different resists were exposed and contrast curves were measured by atomic force microscopy. The least sensitive were the unfunctionalized calix[6]arenes with threshold doses of about 2 mC/cm2. The fully functionalized conformers had threshold doses around 0.1 mC/cm2. The sensitivities of both conformers were found to scale directly with the number of attached allyls for the sequence running from 0 to 8 attached functional groups. The molecular weight effect on sensitivity, seen by other groups, appeared only for the heaviest of the nine resists. This conformer, containing six attached functional groups had the highest sensitivity of all those tested. The presence of these two methods for improving sensitivity, partial functionalization of the conformers and higher conformer molecular weight, allows for the possibility of creating a single calixarene resist that is optimized simultaneously for more than one property, such as sensitivity for imaging and etch resistance for pattern transfer.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-pdf/doi/10.1116/1.3610968/15957384/041605_1_online.pdf",""

Microarray analysis of an injured zebrafish optic nerve revealed 120 genes significantly differentially expressed at one or more time points. Atf3, a member of the cAMP‐response element binding protein family, was among these genes and has been previously characterized to become upregulated in response to various stressors in nervous tissue. In the present study, we have been able to employ immunohistochemical techniques and eGFP reporter constructs to show ATF3 labeling in the bundled fiber layer and retinal ganglion cells; however, the lack of a marker for reactive astrocytes has made analyzing ATF3 expression in the glial cells of injured nerves difficult. Using antibodies against ATF3 and the protein bystin, an essential component of astrocyte development and a novel marker for the astrocyte transition from a quiescent to a reactive state in mammals, we show colocalization of bystin like protein and ATF3 in cells morphologically suggestive of hypertrophic astrocytes. These results suggest that ATF3 is expressed by reactive astrocytes in response to injury. Reactive astrocytes are the major cellular components of the glial scar in mammals, the formation of which prevents sprouting neurites from reaching their synaptic targets. The finding that the anti‐bystin antibody labels cells which morphologically appear to be reactive astroctyes supports using zebrafish as a model organism with relevance to human health.","",""

In this work, silicon nanoparticles were synthesized by short-period annealing of silicon-on-insulator substrates to temperatures ranging between 600 and 900 °C in argon gas at atmospheric pressure. Two different top silicon layers were deposited by ion-beam sputtering onto oxidized substrates. The thinner 6 nm top layer samples were annealed to temperatures for 30 s periods while thicker 15 nm top layer samples were annealed for 60 s periods. For both sets of samples, nanoparticles were observed to form at all the anneal temperatures through imaging by AFM. One long-period UHV anneal study, with 30-min anneal times, observed nanoparticle formation at temperatures similar to the current work while another similar long-period UHV anneal reported nanoparticle formation only above well-defined formation temperatures that depended upon the starting top layer thickness. In the current work, the average nanoparticle radius was found to increase both with the final anneal temperature and anneal period. For the highest anneal temperatures of the 6 nm top layer samples, a changing surface topography indicated that the thinner Si source layer was becoming depleted and the nanoparticle formation process was nearing completion. No such changes were observed for the thicker 15 nm samples at the same temperatures.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jva/article-pdf/doi/10.1116/1.3620422/13788446/051508_1_online.pdf",""

New recovery initiatives have recently been implemented to increase Houston toad abundance; however, no robust estimate of population size has been conducted in the last decade of study, nor from this recovery site. To assist with inferences regarding efficacy of current and future management actions, we estimated adult Houston toad abundance on the Griffith League Ranch. Houston toads were sampled at breeding ponds during the 2010 breeding season using a mark–recapture methodology. We analyzed the data using a modified Jolly–Seber open population model in Program MARK. Models were built whereby the probability of capture remained constant, the apparent survival varied with time or was constant, and the probability of entry varied with time. Model averaging was used to account for uncertainty and the derived adult male Houston toad abundance ranged from 201 to 307 individuals. Using a previously determined Griffith League Ranch Houston toad functional sex ratio of 5∶1, we estimated the abundance of the total adult Houston toad population on this primary recovery site to be from 241 to 368 individuals. This study is the first to report a robust abundance estimate of a Houston toad population and provides a foundation for further research to quantify the impact of current and future management actions.","http://meridian.allenpress.com/jfwm/article-pdf/2/2/207/2751817/072011-jfwm-041.pdf",""

The enzyme rhodanese detoxifies cyanide by utilizing sulfur donors to convert cyanide to thiocyanate, and new and improved sulfur donors are actively sought as researchers seek to improve cyanide prophylactics. We have determined brain cytochrome c oxidase activity as a marker for cyanide exposure for mice pre‐treated with various cyanide poisoning prophylactics, including sulfur donors thiosulfate (TS) and thiotaurine (TT3). Brain mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation, the outer mitochondrial membrane was disrupted by a maltoside detergent, and the decrease in absorbance at 550 nm as horse heart ferrocytochrome c (generated by the dithiothreitol reduction of ferricytochrome c) was oxidized was monitored. Overall, the TS control prophylactic treatment provided significant protection of the cytochrome c oxidase activity. The TT3‐treated mice showed reduced cytochrome c oxidase activity even in the absence of cyanide. In both treatment series, addition of exogenous Rh did not significantly enhance the prevention of cytochrome c oxidase inhibition, but the addition of sodium nitrite did. These findings can lead to a better understanding of the protection mechanism by various cyanide antidotal systems.

We have investigated several parameters affecting DNA yield and quality, using a simple chemical‐based purification procedure that was modelled on alkaline lysis methods developed for bacterial cells. The three major steps of the procedure, cell lysis, protein removal and DNA precipitation, were optimized by testing the impacts of several chemicals, including sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), sodium hydroxide, Tris buffer, sodium acetate and potassium acetate. Other parameters, such as the effect of elevated temperatures on cell lysis, were also investigated. A rapid, optimized protocol was derived for the purification of DNA from small cell cultures that can be readily digested with restriction enzymes and used as a template for PCR.

Automation and intelligence are the two key requirements of web-based solution for efficient deployment of virtual supply chains. It was previously shown that an ontological approach, because of its semantic nature, yields more precise results compared to traditional techniques such as keyword search. While the proposed ontology, known as Manufacturing Service Description Language (MSDL), can sufficiently encode structural knowledge in the manufacturing domain, it doesn’t have the required level of expressivity for representing constraint knowledge. This paper introduces an extension to MSDL for formal representation of constraints and rules based on Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL). To identify the rules and to evaluate the performance of the rule-based technique, an experimental approach is followed in this research.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/DETC2011-47768/4537913/1121_1.pdf",""

This paper first discusses the testing that has been performed to develop the material properties used in the design procedure. Then methods for computing the flexural strength, the cracking moment and the deflection are also presented. Deflections are not often an issue and cracking moments can be easily controlled by the amount of prestress. Therefore, the most important concern is providing adequate shear transfer.

Based on data from 2,520 institutionalized male delinquents, ordinary least squares, logistic, and negative binomial regression models indicated that family background variables were largely predictive of multiple facets of delinquent careers. Negative binomial regression models of institutional misconduct indicated that proximal delinquent career variables were more consistently associated with misconduct than distal family background factors. Because institutional behavior can be understood as the importing of family deprivation experiences and chronic delinquency, the life course importation model is a useful conceptual framework to study crime over the life course, even including periods of confinement.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0306624X11383956",""

The samples were analyzed for the presence of salmonellae by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) after semi-selective enrichment. Salmonellae were detected in one water sample directly after precipitation only, while detection in ten biofilm and two crayfish samples was not related to precipitation. Salmonellae were not detected in snails. Characterization of isolates by rep-PCR revealed shared profiles in water and biofilm samples, biofilm and crayfish samples, and biofilm samples collected 23 days apart. These results suggest that salmonellae are infrequently washed into this aquatic ecosystem during precipitation runoff and can potentially take up residency in biofilms which can help facilitate subsequent long-term persistence and eventual transfer through the food chain.","http://iwaponline.com/jwh/article-pdf/9/3/458/395966/458.pdf",""

Waste audit results demonstrated the value of the operation to the university in terms of savings in waste hauling expenditures, as well as showed the percent contamination, and percent waste diverted to the university's recycling and composting program. There was a significant difference between pre and post-test waste audits. The pilot site composting program resulted in a net loss of $3741.35 to the university during the first year, but was expected to produce a positive net return of $2585.11 in subsequent years. The pilot test showed the program was most successful when ongoing education at the dining hall occurred. Additionally, the student-run composting program resulted in hands-on training for students in producing a valuable horticultural commodity in an emerging waste management field. Results also indicated opportunities for further diversion such as the incorporation of compostable cups and utensils, as well as through expanding the operation to include more collection locations.

The strategic management literature describes a firm's business model as reflecting how that firm chooses to compete in the marketplace. Given this linkage between business model, competition, and the marketplace, we conjecture that the persistence of profit margin and asset turnover ratios will be influenced by firms' choices of business model. Further, we hypothesize that this choice of business model influences the relative persistence of the individual revenue and expense components of current profit margin and asset turnover ratios for future profitability ratios. We test these conjectures by (1) partitioning our sample firms according to business model (network carriers versus low-cost carriers), and (2) decomposing sample firms' profit margin and asset turnover ratios into components relating to pricing policy, input cost control, and productivity. We find that the profit margin and asset turnover ratios of network carriers tend to be more persistent than those of low-cost carriers, and that this differential persistence is reflected in the associations between current revenue and expense components, and future profit margin and asset turnover ratios.","https://publications.aaahq.org/jmar/article-pdf/23/1/37/7050/jmar-10124.pdf",""

Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the close association of caveolin and perilipin and lack of interaction between caveolin and ADRP, in keeping with the separation observed with the ConA procedure. The phospholipid monolayer structure was evaluated to reveal that the perilipin-enriched LD exhibited increased rigidity (less fluidity), as shown by increased cholesterol/phospholipid, Sat/Unsat, and Sat/MUFA ratios. These results were confirmed by DPH-TMA, NBD-cholesterol, and NBD-sphingomyelin fluorescence polarization studies. By structure and organization, the perilipin-enriched LD most closely resembled the adipocyte PM. In contrast, the ADRP/TIP47-enriched LD contained a more fluid monolayer membrane, reflecting decreased polarizations and lipid order based on phospholipid fatty acid analysis. Taken together, results indicate that perilipin and associated lipolytic enzymes target areas in the phospholipid monolayer that are highly organized and rigid, similar in structure to localized areas of the PM where cholesterol and fatty acid uptake and efflux occur.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpendo.00109.2011",""

To achieve this goal, we have developed advanced multi-physics, multi-scale, and multi-block numerical models and autonomic systems software for dynamic, data-driven applications systems.

The optimum salinity and solubilization ratio that correspond to ultra-low IFT have recently been shown to be a strong function of the methane mole fraction in the oil at reservoir pressure in some cases. We incorporate a recently developed methodology to determine the optimum salinity and solubilization ratios at reservoir pressure into a chemical flooding simulator (UTCHEM). The proposed method determines the optimum conditions based on density estimates using a cubic equation-of-state and measured phase behavior data at atmospheric pressure. The microemulsion phase behavior (Winsor I, II, and III) are adjusted based on these predicted optimum salinity and solubilization ratio in the simulator. Parameters for surfactant phase behavior equation are modified to account for these changes and the trend in equivalent alkane carbon number is automatically adjusted for pressure and methane content in each simulation gridblock. We use phase behavior data from several potential SP floods to demonstrate the new implementation. The implementation of the new phase behavior model into a chemical flooding simulator can greatly aid in the design of SP floods so that SP flooding failures are less likely to occur. The simulator will also make more accurate estimations of oil recovery. The new approach could also be used to handle free gas that may form in the reservoir. We show that not accounting for the phase behavior changes that occur when methane is present at reservoir pressure can greatly affect the oil recovery of SP floods. Improper design of a SP flood can lead to more oil being produced as a microemulsion phase than as an oil bank. This paper describes the procedure to implement the effect of pressure and solution gas on microemulsion phase behavior in a chemical flooding simulator, which requires the phase behavior data measured at atmospheric pressure.","http://onepetro.org/SPEATCE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/147473-MS/1661130/spe-147473-ms.pdf",""

While researchers have explored the experiences of gay men working “straight jobs” and men doing “women's work” (e.g., nursing, teaching), very little research to date has focused on the experience of men (gay and straight) in careers that are stereotypically identified with gay men (e.g., hairstyling, dance, flight attendance, fashion design, interior design). The purpose of this paper is to address this gap and explore how sexual orientation influences the experiences and perceptions of male interior design students and professionals. Practitioner participants were identified through membership lists of ASID and IIDA, while male interior design students were contacted through the Interior Design Educators Council (IDEC) “listserv” with faculty assistance. Potential subjects were invited to complete an online survey (30 questions for students, 32 questions for practitioners) in the spring of 2008 using SurveyGold, an online survey tool. One hundred sixteen students completed the survey ( N = 116) while 51 practitioners responded ( N = 51). Researchers anticipated that male interior designers encountered stereotyping regarding their sexual orientation, and that this in turn may affect their attitudes toward their career, relationships with colleagues and clients, design perspectives, and self–comfort. Survey responses generally supported these assumptions and serve to quantify and bring to light the complexity of this important and unexplored issue.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1939-1668.2011.01060.x",""

We also use this context to explore auditor selection of reporting outlets, when they do choose to take action. In an experiment with 181 auditors, main effects suggest that likeability reputation is a significant determinant of intention to take action, while performance reputation is marginally significant. As expected, interaction results indicate that auditors have the greatest intention to take action against less likeable, poor performers. Contrary to expectations, intention to take action against a more likeable, good performer is no lower than the mixed conditions. Thus, the influence of the two dimensions of reputation is complex. Additionally, we find auditors are more likely to whistle-blow internally than externally, and through non-anonymous outlets than anonymous outlets. Our contributions include exploring the impact of reputation on the actions of third parties, and advancing prior literature by considering the influence of wrongdoer attributes on reporting decisions and auditors' reporting channel preferences.","https://publications.aaahq.org/bria/article-pdf/23/2/207/53887/bria-50022.pdf",""

To localize frequency content in time, we have developed a novel method for computing a time-frequency map for nonstationary signals using an iterative inversion framework. We calculated time-varying Fourier coefficients by solving a least-squares problem that uses regularized nonstationary regression. We defined the time-frequency map as the norm of time-varying coefficients. Time-varying average frequency of the seismic data can also be estimated from the time-frequency map calculated by our method. We tested the method on benchmark synthetic signals and compared it with the well-known S-transform. Two field data examples showed applications of the proposed method for delineation of sand channels and for detection of low-frequency anomalies.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/geo2010-0185.1",""

This integrative literature review provides the first synthesis of public pedagogy research through a thematic analysis of a sample of 420 publications. Finding that the public pedagogy construct is often undertheorized and ambiguously presented in education research literature, the study identifies five primary categories of extant public pedagogy research: (a) citizenship within and beyond schools, (b) popular culture and everyday life, (c) informal institutions and public spaces, (d) dominant cultural discourses, and (e) public intellectualism and social activism. These categories provide researchers with a conceptual framework for investigating public pedagogy and for locating future scholarship. The study identifies the need for theoretical specificity in research that employs the public pedagogy construct and for empirical studies that investigate the processes of public pedagogy, particularly in terms of the learner’s perspective.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3102/0034654311413395",""

Therefore, nowadays calculating software metrics from UML diagrams to evaluate software quality is an important trend in the software industry. However, acquisition of software metrics from Extensible Markup Language (XML) export of UML tools has been predominantly tool dependent. Moreover, each new tool may have different specifications in XML. Despite the overall need for a process to automate XML unification, no current solution has yet been proposed. Creating a framework to automate this assessment would streamline development and increase efficiency in software industry. With the aim to overcome this deficiency, we developed a parser-based framework, named UXSOM, to calculate software metrics independently from the UML tool. Particularly UXSOM is able to generate software metrics from the XML-based outputs of the tools, ArgoUML, UMLET, MagicDraw, Sparx Systems, and ESS Model. We showed a very general case of UML class diagram, in which we extracted and compared software metrics from these five different tool.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1968587.1968609",""

We surveyed amphibians and predatory invertebrates before and after fires occurring during summer 2010. We tested for treatment (i.e., control, wildfire, or prescribed burn) and status (i.e., preburn or postburn) differences in 1) genus-level captures, 2) amphibian health (inferred through a body condition index), and 3) predatory invertebrate captures. Bufo and Scaphiopus captures increased in the prescribed burn treatment; whereas, no differences in Gastrophryne captures were observed. We did not detect a burn status effect on amphibian body condition. Predatory invertebrate captures were higher postburn in the control and wildfire treatments. Neither a low-intensity prescribed burn nor high-intensity wildfires negatively impacted short-term juvenile amphibian captures. Further, we speculate that Bufo and Scaphiopus survivorship may have been higher after the prescribed burn.","http://meridian.allenpress.com/jfwm/article-pdf/2/2/135/2751827/062011-jfwm-037.pdf",""

These schemes adopt long operators in regions of low velocity and short operators in regions of high velocity. Two methods automatically determine variable operator lengths. Dispersion analysis, along with 1D and 2D modeling, demonstrates the validity and efficiency of our schemes. In addition, a hybrid absorbing boundary condition helps reduce unwanted reflections from model boundaries. Our scheme is more efficient than those based on variable-grid methods for modeling, migration, and inversion of models with complex velocity structures because the latter require local grid refinement, which usually increases memory requirements and computing costs.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/1.3587223",""

While gate delay has decreased with transistor scaling, the increase in the resistive capacitive (RC) delay due to shrinking interconnect dimensions has become a serious concern for the development of future-generation electronics. To reduce the delay due to resistance R, a major technology change was the replacement of Aluminum (Al) with Copper (Cu) interconnects. Recently, some investigators have suggested using low-k dielectric (having dielectric constant less than 4) instead of Silicon dioxide (k = 3.9) to reduce the capacitive component in the RC delay. Recent research has shown low-k materials to have characteristics such as low mechanical strength and adhesion. In this paper, thermo-mechanical analysis of a single chip flip-chip module (SCM) consisting of a die integrated with low-k dielectric medium, substrate, solder balls, and a printed circuit board (PCB) is performed. The analysis is done in two steps within the ANSYS finite element software to account for thermally induced stresses due to mismatch in thermal expansion coefficient. In the first step, the thermal analysis is carried out to derive the steady state temperature distribution within the package under the imposed power rating. In the second step, the evaluated temperature field is utilized in a coupled thermo-mechanical structural analysis. The developed framework is utilized to study the thermo-mechanical behavior of various low-k dielectrics, wherein the stresses and strain distributions within the chip region are quantified. The analysis has shown no change in the temperature distribution between the base case of Silicon dioxide (SiO2) and low-k materials. The maximum equivalent stress in the package, for all the four dielectric cases (SiO2, polyimide, Hydrogen Silsesquioxane, and Black diamond) is seen in the silicon region of the die and that it does not change with the dielectric materials. However, the maximum equivalent stress in the low-k/metal layers varies with the materials but is always few orders of magnitude less than their corresponding yield strengths. Comparative analysis between Silicon dioxide (SiO2) and different low-k materials will help in identifying the weak spots in low-k dielectric when exposed to standard user environments.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2011-63670/2778324/353_1.pdf",""

The CHP system provides electrical energy through a prime mover located near the building it serves, and waste heat from this generation is captured and delivered to the building to provide thermal energy. For a CHP system to show an economic advantage over a conventional system, its operating costs must be lower when providing the same amount of thermal energy and electricity that would have come from the SHP system. The spark spread (SS), or price difference between purchased electricity and fuel, is used as a simple indicator as to whether the CHP system is economically viable. Rather than using a single value of SS as a cutoff for viability of the CHP system, a more detailed spark spread expressed in terms of the efficiencies of the CHP system and SHP system components can be used to determine if a CHP system is economically viable. In an initial feasibility study, the calculation of the SS is based on estimates of a number of variables. It is important to assess the likely impact of changes in certain of some of these variables, as such changes can affect the SS calculations. This paper presents a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects of different parameters on the cost ratio which is used to calculate SS, including: reference heating system efficiency, power generation unit (PGU) efficiency and CHP overall system efficiency. Because CHP system efficiency itself is a function of the PGU efficiency as well as the thermal efficiency, these two parts of the total system efficiency are also investigated separately. Since the cost of purchased electricity and fuel varies by geographic region, the required spark spread for a given system may indicate favorable economics for a CHP system in one location while the CHP system shows no potential for savings in another location. Therefore, the sensitivity analysis is considered for three different U.S. locations.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2011-62542/2775690/641_1.pdf",""

However, little is known about racial/ethnic differences in early childhood mortality. PATIENTS AND METHODS:: We conducted a retrospective cohort study with data from the Texas Birth Defect Registry on 19 530 singleton, live-born infants with a CHD and born January 1, 1996, to December 31, 2003, to non-Hispanic (NH) white, NH black, and Hispanic women. Texas Birth Defect Registry data were linked to Texas death records and the National Death Index to ascertain deaths between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2005. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were computed, and hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated from multivariable Cox-proportional hazard regression models to determine the effect of maternal race/ethnicity on mortality for selected CHD phenotypes. RESULTS:: After adjusting for covariates, compared with NH white children, NH black children had increased early childhood mortality risk for transposition of the great arteries (HR: 2.04 [95% CI: 1.40–2.97]), tetralogy of Fallot (HR: 1.85 [95% CI: 1.09–3.12]), pulmonary valve atresia without ventricular septal defect (VSD) (HR: 2.60 [95% CI: 1.32–5.12]), VSD (HR: 1.56 [95% CI: 1.19–2.03]), and atrial septal defect (HR: 1.34 [95% CI: 1.08–1.66]). Hispanic children had higher mortality risk for pulmonary valve atresia without VSD (HR: 1.76 [95% CI: 1.06–2.91]) and hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HR: 1.51 [95% CI: 1.13–2.02]). CONCLUSIONS:: We provide evidence that supports racial/ethnic disparities in early childhood mortality among infants with CHDs. Identifying infants with the greatest risk of early childhood mortality will facilitate development of interventions and policies to mitigate these risks.","https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-pdf/127/5/e1128/908252/zpe005110e1128.pdf",""

The approach is based on the linearized perturbative technique developed by Rajan et al. [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 82, 998–1017 (1987)]. This method is applied by assuming a background starting model for the environment that includes both the water column and the seabed. Typically, the water column properties are assumed to be known and held fixed in the inversion. Successful application of the perturbative inverse technique lies in handling issues of stability and uniqueness associated with solving a discrete ill-posed problem. Conventionally, such problems are regularized, a procedure which results in a smooth solution. Past applications of this inverse technique have been restricted to cases for which the water column sound speed profile was known and sound speed in the seabed could be approximated by a smooth profile. In this work, constraints that are better suited to specific aspects of the geoacoustic inverse problem are applied. These techniques expand on the original application of the perturbative inverse technique by including the water column sound speed profile in the solution and by allowing for discontinuities in the seabed sound speed profile.","https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article-pdf/129/2/652/14801282/652_1_online.pdf",""

Results. Asthma management and healthy homes knowledge, including attitudes and practices, significantly improved among parents after the implementation of the dual training program. Of the 108 participants, 78% had never received asthma education, 78% had a child with lifetime asthma diagnosed by his/her physician, and 32% reported having medical insurance. Pretest and posttest comparison results based on 9 out of 14 questions related to asthma triggers and healthy home principles showed a significant improvement in knowledge gained among the participants. Regardless of the study limitations (self-report instrument for the pretest and the posttest), the results showed that families in colonias living with asthma benefit from an integrated training approach.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2150129711426571",""

Glasgow & J. Cowley, 1994) is widely used in clinical and research settings to determine children’s language abilities, although possible influences of race and maternal education on RBS–NA performance are unknown. The current study compared RBS–NA retells of 4 groups of children: African American (AA) children and European American (EA) children whose mothers had an education level of high school or less (≤ HS) and those whose mothers had an education level higher than high school (> HS). Method: Statistical tests were used to examine 172 kindergartners' story retells using raw scores for all 4 RBS–NA measures: (a) Information, (b) Sentence Length, (c) Complexity, and (d) Independence. Results: A 2 × 2 analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed main effects of maternal education and race for the Information score, with ≤ HS and AA children scoring lower. For measures not meeting ANOVA assumptions, 2 × 2 ANOVAs using ranked data indicated significant main effects of maternal education for Sentence Length, Complexity, and Independence measure, with ≤ HS children scoring lower within the AA group. Conclusion: There are systematic effects of maternal education and race on children’s RBS–NA performance, which is important for both researchers and clinicians to take into account when using this instrument.","http://pubs.asha.org/doi/pdf/10.1044/1092-4388%282011/10-0079%29",""

SKP1 is a component of SCF (for SKP1-Cullin-F box protein) ubiquitin ligase complexes that target proteins for proteasomal degradation. Expression of PVX TGBp3 from a heterologous vector induces the same set of genes in N. benthamiana and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaves. Virus-induced gene silencing was employed to knock down the expression of bZIP60 and SKP1, and the number of infection foci on inoculated leaves was reduced and systemic PVX accumulation was altered. Silencing bZIP60 led to the suppression of BiP and SKP1 transcript levels, suggesting that bZIP60 might be an upstream signal transducer. Overexpression of TGBp3 led to localized necrosis, but coexpression of TGBp3 with BiP abrogated necrosis, demonstrating that the unfolded protein response alleviates ER stress-related cell death. Steady-state levels of PVX replicase and TGBp2 (which reside in the ER) proteins were unaltered by the presence of TGBp3, suggesting that TGBp3 does not contribute to their turnover. Taken together, PVX TGBp3-induced ER stress leads to up-regulation of bZIP60 and unfolded protein response-related gene expression, which may be important to regulate cellular cytotoxicity that could otherwise lead to cell death if viral proteins reach high levels in the ER.","http://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-pdf/156/2/741/37143581/plphys_v156_2_741.pdf",""

In particular, a novel kernel smoothing method with variable bandwidth is introduced and its performance is compared to that of the widely used Gaspari–Cohn filter, which uses a fifth-order kernel function with a fixed localization length. Numerical experiments are carried out with the 40-variable Lorenz-96 model. The results of the experiments show that the nonparametric approach provides a more accurate estimate of the background error covariance matrix than the Gaspari–Cohn filter with any localization length. It is also shown that the Gaspari–Cohn filter tends to provide more accurate estimates of the covariance with shorter localization lengths. However, the analyses obtained by using longer localization lengths tend to be more accurate than those produced by using short localization lengths or the nonparametric approach. This seemingly paradoxical result is explained by showing that localization with longer localization lengths produces filtered estimates whose time mean is the most similar to the time mean of both the unfiltered estimate and the true covariance. This result suggests that a better metric of covariance filtering skill would be one that combined a measure of closeness to the sample covariance matrix for a very large ensemble with a measure of similarity between the climatological averages of the filtered and sample covariance.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/2011MWR3577.1",""

Method: Participants included 60 first- and second-grade African American, Latino American, and Caucasian children. A subset of narratives based on wordless picture books collected as part of a larger study was coded and analyzed for the following creative and stylistic conventions: organizational style (topic centered, linear, cyclical), dialogue (direct, indirect), reference to character relationships (nature, naming, conduct), embellishment (fantasy, suspense, conflict), and paralinguistic devices (expressive sounds, exclamatory utterances). Results: Many similarities and differences between ethnic groups were found. No significant differences were found between ethnic groups in organizational style or use of paralinguistic devices. African American children included more fantasy in their stories, Latino children named their characters more often, and Caucasian children made more references to the nature of character relationships. Conclusion: Even within the context of a highly structured narrative task based on wordless picture books, culture influences children’s production of narratives. Enhanced understanding of narrative structure, creativity, and style is necessary to provide ecologically valid narrative assessment and intervention for children from diverse cultural backgrounds.","http://pubs.asha.org/doi/pdf/10.1044/0161-1461%282010/10-0052%29",""

Background:: Team coordination dynamics has revealed that “mixing” team membership can lead to flexible interaction processes, but keeping a team “intact” can lead to rigid interaction processes. We hypothesized that communication of intact teams would have greater determinism and higher pattern information compared to that of mixed teams. Method:: Determinism and pattern information were measured from three-person Uninhabited Air Vehicle team communication sequences over a series of 40-minute missions. Because team members communicated using push-to-talk buttons, communication sequences were automatically generated during each mission. Results:: The Composition × Mission determinism effect was significant. Intact teams’ determinism increased over missions, whereas mixed teams’ determinism did not change. Intact teams had significantly higher maximum pattern information than mixed teams. Conclusion:: Results from these new communication analysis methods converge with content-based methods and support our hypotheses. Application:: Because they are not content based, and because they are automatic and fast, these new methods may be amenable to real-time communication pattern analysis.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0018720811426140",""

We argue that narrative development processes make this organizational learning possible. By developing narratives, organizational actors create situated understandings of unusual experiences, negotiate consensual meanings, and engage in coordinated actions. Through the accumulation of narratives about unusual experiences, an organization builds a memory with generative qualities. Specifically, through narratives, actors evoke memories of prior unusual experiences and how they were dealt with, and this generates new options for dealing with emerging unusual experiences. We outline a framework detailing how narrative development processes enable organizational learning from unusual experiences and conclude by summarizing how this approach differs from and yet builds upon scientific and experiential approaches to learning.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/orsc.1100.0536",""

Anvils observable by the PR occur, on average, 5 out of every 100 days within grid boxes with 2.5° resolution and with a conditional areal coverage of 1.5%. Unconditional areal coverage is only a few tenths of a percent. Anvils also had an average 17-dBZ echo top of ∼8.5 km and an average thickness of ∼2.7 km. Anvils were usually higher and thicker over land compared to ocean, and occurred most frequently over Africa, the Maritime Continent, and Panama. Anvil properties were intimately tied to the properties of the parent convection. In particular, anvil area and echo-top heights were highly correlated to convective rain area. The next best predictor for anvil areal coverage and echo tops was convective echo tops, while convective reflectivities had the weakest correlation. Strong upper-level wind shear also may be associated with anvil occurrence over land, especially when convection regularly attains echo-top heights greater than 7 km. Some tropical land regions, especially those affected by monsoon circulations, experience significant seasonal variability in anvil properties—strong interannual anvil variability occurs over the central Pacific because of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation.

Methods:: Linear regression was used to examine the influence of gender role on somatic and antisocial symptomatology. Path analysis was used to examine whether relationships among these variables differed significantly for men and women. Participants were 349 undergraduate students in southeastern USA. Results:: Masculine gender role was positively related to antisocial behaviour, while feminine gender role was negatively related to antisocial behaviour. Gender role did not predict somatization. Conclusions:: Gender role may be important to the expression of antisocial behaviour, but does not influence somatic symptoms. Current findings underscore the need to consider that observed sex differences in antisocial behaviour might actually be affected by gender role, and highlight the importance of considering societal expectations of male and female behaviour when examining apparent sex differences in behaviour.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0020764011406807",""

Whether XMRV plays a role in cancer and other diseases remains controversial; some studies show a possible association, but there is currently no evidence that the virus is a causal agent for disease. Our hypothesis was that the 3′ long terminal repeat (LTR) from the XMRV genome is responsible for its oncogenic activity in prostate cells. We chose three regions from the XMRV 3′ LTR and tested the potential of these regions in transactivating a cellular gene promoter whose homolog is transactivated by MMLV in mouse cells. We examined the transactivation potential in pre-cancerous and a panel of cancerous prostate epithelial cells. Our results showed that for certain 3′LTR regions induce nearly full transactivating activity, while others might comprise inhibitory regions. Therefore, to better understand the mechanism by which the XMRV 3′ LTR regions might be inducing or inhibiting transactivation, we tested their ability to transactivate cellular genes related to transformation. We used as reporters plasmids containing binding sites for cellular transcription factors. The results showed several similarities in transactivation, suggesting common activation pathways for 3′LTR transactivating activity. Finally, we tested if XMRV infection could enhance oncogenicity potential of prostate precancerous and cancerous cell lines. We examined this in vitro by assessing the rate of colony formation in soft agar, and in vivo, using xenograft assays. The results suggested that cell lines infected with XMRV had enhanced in vitro colony formation, as well as enhanced in vivo growth, however, addition of another tumorigenic genetic alteration was required in conjunction with XMRV-infection to induce enhanced tumor growth. Our data suggests that the XMRV 3′LTR may have a transactivating activity on cellular genes, and that XMRV might have a transforming activity in prostate cancer cells, most likely stimulating promotion/progression of tumorigenesis, and not ‘initiation’ of tumorigenesis. These results are highly novel since they represent for the first examinations of the role of XMRV in tumorigenesis of prostate epithelial cell lines in vitro and in vivo and examinations of the 3′LTR context of the virus upon transactivation of cellular genes as a potential mechanism of cellular transformation.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/71/8_Supplement/LB-433/575163/Abstract-LB-433-Examination-of-the-oncogenic",""

This reality is in stark contrast to the industry-standard design models based on the assumption of symmetric, planar, biwing geometry. The interaction between pre-existing natural fractures and the advancing hydraulic fracture is a key condition leading to complex fracture patterns. Performing hydraulic-fracture-design calculations under these less-than-ideal conditions requires modeling fracture intersections and tracking fluid fronts in the network of reactivated fissures. Whether a hydraulic fracture crosses or is arrested by a pre-existing natural fracture is controlled by shear strength and potential slippage at the fracture intersections, as well as potential debonding of sealed cracks in the near-tip region of a propagating hydraulic fracture. We present a complex hydraulic-fracture pattern propagation model based on the extended finite-element method (XFEM) as a design tool that can be used to optimize treatment parameters under complex propagation conditions. Results demonstrate that fracture-pattern complexity is strongly controlled by the magnitude of anisotropy of in-situ stresses, rock toughness, and natural-fracture cement strength, as well as the orientation of the natural fractures relative to the hydraulic fracture. Analysis shows that the growing hydraulic fracture may exert enough tensile and shear stresses on cemented natural fractures that the latter may be debonded, opened, and/or sheared in advance of hydraulic-fracture-tip arrival, while under other conditions, natural fractures will be unaffected by the hydraulic fracture. Detailed aperture distributions at the intersection between fracture segments show the potential for difficulty in proppant transport under complex fracture-propagation conditions.","http://onepetro.org/SJ/article-pdf/16/03/575/2107035/spe-124884-pa.pdf",""

In this approach, proximal and distal arterial waveforms are measured and respectively regarded as the input and output of a system. Next, the system impulse response is identified from all samples of the measured input and output. Finally, the time delay of the impulse response is detected as the PTT estimate. Unlike conventional foot-to-foot detection techniques, this approach is designed to provide an artifact robust estimate of the true PTT in the absence of wave reflection. The approach is also applicable to arbitrary types of arterial waveforms. We specifically applied a parametric system identification technique to noninvasive impedance cardiography (ICG) and peripheral arterial blood pressure waveforms from 15 humans subjected to lower-body negative pressure. We assessed the technique through the correlation coefficient ( r) between its 1/PTT estimates and measured diastolic pressure (DP) per subject and the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the DP predicted from these estimates and measured DP. The technique achieved average r and RMSE values of 0.81 ± 0.16 and 4.3 ± 1.3 mmHg. For comparison, the corresponding values were 0.59 ± 0.37 ( P < 0.05) and 5.9 ± 2.5 ( P < 0.01) mmHg for the conventional technique applied to the same waveforms and 0.28 ± 0.40 ( P < 0.001) and 7.2 ± 1.8 ( P < 0.001) mmHg for the conventional technique with the ECG waveform substituted for the ICG waveform. These results demonstrate, perhaps for the first time, that the system identification approach can indeed improve PTT estimation.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpheart.00443.2011",""

It has been proposed that increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by dysfunctional mitochondria could play a role in the pathogenesis of these metabolic abnormalities. We examined whether aging per se (in subjects with normal glucose tolerance [NGT]) impairs mitochondrial function and how this relates to ROS generation, whether older subjects with IGT have a further worsening of mitochondrial function (lower ATP production and elevated ROS generation), and whether exercise reverses age-related changes in mitochondrial function. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Mitochondrial ATP and ROS production were measured in muscle from younger individuals with NGT, older individuals with NGT, and older individuals with IGT. Measurements were performed before and after 16 weeks of aerobic exercise. RESULTS: ATP synthesis was lower in older subjects with NGT and older subjects with IGT versus younger subjects. Notably, mitochondria from older subjects (with NGT and IGT) displayed reduced ROS production versus the younger group. ATP and ROS production were similar between older groups. Exercise increased ATP synthesis in the three groups. Mitochondrial ROS production also increased after training. Proteomic analysis revealed downregulation of several electron transport chain proteins with aging, and this was reversed by exercise. CONCLUSIONS: Old mitochondria from subjects with NGT and IGT display mitochondrial dysfunction as manifested by reduced ATP production but not with respect to increased ROS production. When adjusted to age, the development of IGT in elderly individuals does not involve changes in mitochondrial ATP and ROS production. Lastly, exercise reverses the mitochondrial phenotype (proteome and function) of old mitochondria.","https://journals.org/diabetes/diabetes/article-pdf/60/8/2051/509280/2051.pdf",""

Both of these fuels now depend on land and crops (e.g. oil seeds, palm trees, maize and sugar cane) that are also used for foods. To meet growing demand and avoid competition with food, major expansion of biofuel production and development of new sources of biofuel are required.

Rather than husbands’ desires dictating whether wives work for pay or not, results from this study indicate that women in central Texas chose husbands according to how supportive they were of their wives’ wishes. Their decisions to work for pay or not were influenced by their perceived need for more income, whether their own mothers worked, and their socialization. Components of socialization found related to work decisions included “gender strategies” (Hochschild & Machung, 1989), which are peoples’ childhood conceptualizations about gender combined with their teenage experiences and finally rectified with current feelings about societal norms and how one’s own attitudes and behaviors compare to those norms. Another component of socialization related to women’s work and family decisions is the “motherhood mandate,” a perspective that teaches women to believe that their greatest fulfillment stems directly from being a mother (Russo, 1979). Despite employment, women tended to carry the lion’s share of domestic duties. The findings suggest that both external constraints and personal preference guide women’s work decisions.","https://utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/jcfs.42.1.113",""

Using data from Malawi, a religiously diverse African country with high HIV prevalence, we find that faith healing is pervasive across multiple religious traditions. For individuals, attending a faith healing congregation is associated with lower levels of generalized worry about AIDS, and this association is driven by those who switched churches before AIDS became widespread in rural areas. Use of condoms and traditional medicine are, on the other hand, positively associated with worry about AIDS. We argue that faith healing can be understood as a third therapeutic system that coexists with the well-documented biomedical and traditional systems.

Results: Evidence of L1–L2 transfer was observed through duration but not amplitude cues. More proficient L2 speakers varied duration to mark iambic stress. Perceptually, the high-proficiency group received relatively higher native-like accent ratings. Trochees were judged as more native than iambs. Conclusions: Even in the face of L1–L2 lexical stress transfer, nonnative speakers demonstrated knowledge of prosodic contrasts. Movement duration appears to be more amenable than amplitude to modifications.","http://pubs.asha.org/doi/pdf/10.1044/1092-4388%282010/09-0018%29",""

Significant improvements in performance accuracy were observed in Session 2 only in the group whose sessions were separated by 24 hr. There were significant increases in performance speed in Session 2 in all three practice conditions, results which likely were attributable to the inclusion of all Session 1 data in the analysis.

The copula concept overcomes this restriction by allowing a combination of arbitrarily chosen marginal types. It also provides a wider choice of admissible dependence structure as compared to the conventional approach. The availability of a vast variety of copula types makes the selection of an appropriate copula family for different hydrological applications a non-trivial task. Graphical and analytic goodness-of-fit tests for testing the suitability of copulas are beginning to evolve and are being developed; there is limited experience of their usage at present, especially in the hydrological field. This paper provides a step-wise procedure for copula selection and illustrates its application to bivariate flood frequency analysis, involving flood peak flow and volume data. Several graphical procedures, tail dependence characteristics, and formal goodness-of-fit tests involving a parametric bootstrap-based technique are considered while investigating the relative applicability of six copula families.

These highly pathogenic viruses and the Old World Lassa fever virus pose a significant threat to public health and national security. The only licensed antiviral agent with activity against these viruses, ribavirin, has had mixed success in treating severe arenaviral disease and is associated with significant toxicities. A novel pyrazine derivative currently in clinical trials for the treatment of influenza virus infections, T-705 (favipiravir), has demonstrated broad-spectrum activity against a number of RNA viruses, including arenaviruses. T-705 has also been shown to be effective against Pichinde arenavirus infection in a hamster model. Here, we demonstrate the robust antiviral activity of T-705 against authentic highly pathogenic arenaviruses in cell culture. We show that T-705 disrupts an early or intermediate stage in viral replication, distinct from absorption or release, and that its antiviral activity in cell culture is reversed by the addition of purine bases and nucleosides, but not with pyrimidines. Specific inhibition of viral replication/transcription by T-705 was demonstrated using a lymphocytic choriomeningitis arenavirus replicon system. Our findings indicate that T-705 acts to inhibit arenavirus replication/transcription and may directly target the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/AAC.01219-10",""

There are several methods to determine the MMP, but the most accurate methods are slim-tube experiments, analytical methods, and numerical-simulation/cell-to-cell methods. Slim-tube experiments are important to perform because they use actual crude oil, but they are costly and time consuming. Analytical methods that use the method of characteristics (MOC) are very fast and help to understand the structure of gasfloods. MOC, however, relies on finding the unique and correct set of key tie lines in the displacements, which can be difficult. Slim-tube simulation methods and their simplified cell-to-cell derivatives require tedious fluid and rock inputs, and their MMP estimates can be clouded by dispersion.","http://onepetro.org/SJ/article-pdf/16/04/733/2104581/spe-116823-pa.pdf",""

In the ocean model, the strength of the AMOC is controlled by specifying mass transport at open boundaries. The fidelity of the reduced-physics model in capturing major features of tropical Atlantic variability, as well as its response to the AMOC changes, is demonstrated in a series of model experiments. The results of the experiments reveal the relative importance of oceanic processes and atmospheric processes in AMOC-induced tropical Atlantic variability–change. It is found that the oceanic processes are a primary factor contributing to the warming at and south of the equator and the precipitation increase over the Gulf of Guinea, while atmospheric processes are responsible for the surface cooling of the tropical North Atlantic and southward displacement of ITCZ.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jcli/article-pdf/24/13/3323/3983307/2011jcli3845_1.pdf",""

This type of experiments is most of the time difficult to perform. In general, the difficulty is derived from the nature of the experiment which involves human subjects in a creative process solving design problems. The subjects, creative process, method involved, and design problem, each brings an abundance of variables some of which are qualitative (e.g. subject’s personality). Based on the extensive experience running engineering design creativity experiments, the authors present a review of major issues related to the design of experiments (DOE) of engineering design creativity experiments. First, an overview of creativity experimentation is presented; this includes the identification of key elements: subject, design process, treatment, controls, output and environment. Second, an overview of the design of experiment (DOE) steps is presented: hypothesis, factors, responses, etc. Third, for each step in the DOE the authors identify typical issues related to engineering design creativity. Each issue is analyzed, referred to other experiments in the literature, and a series of practical recommendations are made. The scope of the paper is limited to engineering design creativity experiments, more specifically, when the assessment is performed on the outcome. Also, the focus is on the “conceptual model” (i.e. planning stage) of DOE. Future papers will focus on the execution of the experiment and the assessment process. The authors hope that these guidelines help designologists improve the relevance, significance, and accuracy of creativity experiments.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/DETC2011-48402/2811218/773_1.pdf",""

Many stories, however, simultaneously covered the claim in typical ‘he said/she said’ fashion, thus perhaps extending some legitimacy to the claim.

Multiple ulcers were present on the commissures of the lips, dorsal surface of the tongue, and left caudal buccal surface of the oral cavity. The abdomen was filled with fibrinopurulent exudate and ruminal contents. Multiple to coalescing transmural ulcers were identified in the rumen. Histopathological evaluation of the skin revealed markedly thickened epidermis and focal areas of superficial dermal fibrosis, intracytoplasmic, eosinophilic inclusions in swollen keratinocytes and lymphocytic and plasmacytic perivascular dermatitis. The rumen ulcers were surrounded with necrotic cellular debris mixed with fibrin, bacteria, hemorrhages, and a collection of mixed inflammatory cells. Some swollen ruminal mucosal epithelia had eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions. Poxvirus was isolated from the skin and rumen tissue specimens. Electron microscopy detected viral particles with poxvirus morphology. Polymerase chain reaction assays detected A21, a gene conserved within family Poxviridae, in the skin and rumen tissues. Phylogenic analysis of the A21 sequences indicated that the viral isolate (M10-9055) was closely related to known members of genus Cervidpoxvirus.

Objective. To assess the opportunity of pressure response to voluntary breath holding (30 second breath holding test) to detect masked arterial hypertension in young subjects. Design and methods. 269 young subjects (18-36 years old) with no clinical signs of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, any chronic diseases including pulmonary diseases, who did not do sports professionally, underwent 30 second breath holding test. Results. The results of breath holding and 24 hour monitoring tests coincided in 250 out of 269 cases (93 %). Latent hypertensions was diagnosed (by 24 hour blood pressure monitoring) in none of the subjects with normal or high normal resting blood pressure and negative breath holding test (negative predictive value - 100 %).

Quadrupole time-of-flight and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry provided evidence for the presence of membrane lipids containing one or more oxidized acyl chains. The membrane lipids included molecular species of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, digalactosyldiacylglycerol, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, and acylated monogalactosyldiacylglycerol. The oxidized chains were identified at the level of chemical formula and included C18H27O3 (abbreviated 18:4-O, to indicate four double bond equivalents and one oxygen beyond the carbonyl group), C18H29O3 (18:3-O), C18H31O3 (18:2-O), C18H29O4 (18:3-2O), C18H31O4 (18:2-2O), and C16H23O3 (16:4-O). Mass spectral signals from the polar oxidized lipid (ox-lipid) species were quantified in extracts of Arabidopsis leaves subjected to wounding, infection by PstAvr, infection by a virulent strain of P. syringae, and low temperature. Ox-lipids produced low amounts of mass spectral signal, 0.1% to 3.2% as much as obtained in typical direct infusion profiling of normal-chain membrane lipids of the same classes. Analysis of the oxidized membrane lipid species and normal-chain phosphatidic acids indicated that stress-induced ox-lipid composition differs from the basal ox-lipid composition. Additionally, different stresses result in the production of varied amounts, different timing, and different compositional patterns of stress-induced membrane lipids. These data form the basis for a working hypothesis that the stress-specific signatures of ox-lipids, like those of oxylipins, are indicative of their functions.","http://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-pdf/158/1/324/37156221/plphys_v158_1_324.pdf",""

The regenerative cutting force generates time-delay effects in the tool equation of motion, which retained the nonlinear terms up to the third order in this work. Then, an ungrounded nonlinear energy sink (NES) was coupled to the SDOF tool, by which biased energy transfers from the tool to the NES and efficient dissipation can be realized whenever regenerative effects invoke instability in the tool. Shifts of the stability boundary (i.e., Hopf bifurcation point) with respect to chip thickness were examined for various NES parameters. There seems to exist an optimal value of damping for a fixed mass ratio to shift the stability boundary for stably cutting more material off by increasing chip thickness; on the other hand, the larger the mass ratio becomes, the further the occurrence of Hopf bifurcation is delayed. The limit cycle oscillation (LCO) due to the regenerative instability appears as being subcritical, which can be (locally) eliminated or attenuated at a fixed rotational speed of a workpiece by the nonlinear modal interactions with an NES (i.e., by means of TETs). Three suppression mechanisms have been identified; that is, recurrent burstouts and suppressions, partial and complete suppressions of regenerative instabilities in a machine tool model. Each suppression mechanism was characterized numerically by time histories of displacements, and wavelet transforms and instantaneous energies. Furthermore, analytical study was performed by employing the complexification-averaging technique to yield a time-delayed slow-flow model. Finally, regenerative instability suppression in a more practical machine tool model was examined by considering contact-loss conditions.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/DETC2011-48502/2768790/1215_1.pdf",""

Corrected correlations were .26 between lateness and absenteeism, .25 between absenteeism and turnover, and .01 between lateness and turnover. These correlations were even smaller in recent studies that had been carried out since the previous meta‐analyses of these relationships 15–20 years ago. The small‐to‐moderate intercorrelations are not supportive of a withdrawal construct that includes lateness, absenteeism, and turnover. These intercorrelations also rule out many of the competing models of the relationships between withdrawal behaviors, as many of the models assume all relationships will be positive, null, or negative. On the basis of path analyses using meta‐analytic data, the progression of withdrawal model garnered the most support. This suggests that lateness may moderately predict absenteeism and absenteeism may moderately predict turnover.

The complexity of this problem is mainly due to lack of formal representation frameworks that lend themselves easily to a computational approach. Generative grammar has emerged as a potential solution to this problem and presents a number of different possibilities for conceptual design automation. This paper presents a novel search method that has been developed specifically for search trees defined by a special class of generative grammar in which rules of the grammar have parameters associated with them. A novel feature of the proposed search is ‘Human in the loop’ approach in which learning about the search space is achieved by querying the user. The user fatigue restricts the maximum number of comparisons of candidate solutions (30–50). From the data gathered from the comparisons, a stochastic decision making process proposed in this paper quickly converges to a region of design space which best meet the user’s preference. The method is implemented and applied to a grammar for shampoo bottle concept generation. It is shown through multiple user-guided and automated experiments that the method has ability to learn and adopt through human computer interaction process. The implications of the proposed search method for automated conceptual design are expounded on in the conclusions.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/DETC2011-47743/2773891/987_1.pdf",""

At least 70% of breast cancers are ER positive, constituting eligible candidates for Tam treatment. Nonetheless, recurrent disease occurs in one third of patients treated with Tam within 15 years of therapy, implying that approximately one-quarter of all breast cancers are Tam-resistant either in initial presentation or recurrent disease. Thus, Tam resistance has become a major clinical issue in the treatment of breast cancer. Yet, the molecular mechanism behind Tam resistance is still not completely understood. A better understanding of the genetic or epigenetic changes associated with Tam resistance should facilitate circumventing this problem. In this study, using next generation sequencing technology, we sought to compare the transcriptomes of Tam sensitive and resistant breast cancer cells, in order to identify genes involved in the development of Tam resistance. rRNA depleted total RNA from MTR-3 (a Tam-resistant breast cancer cell line derived by culturing MCF-7 cells continuously for a two-year period in the presence of 1 μM Tam) and from parental MCF-7 cells were sequenced on an Applied Biosystems-SOLiD V3 sequencer. Short-read (50 bp) libraries were sequenced and mapped to the reference human genome (hg18) by Maq, and whole transcriptomes for the two cell lines were constructed and compared for their gene expression. 140 million total reads were produced by sequencing, and ∼ 50% were accurately mapped. AB WT Analysis Pipeline was used to confirm results and score expression. Gene network and pathway analysis were constructed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and GeneGeo. Potential gene candidates were validated using TaqMan Gene Expression assays. Based on a 1.7 fold criterion, we found that 667 genes, including those vital to cell cycle, cell death, cancer development, and energy metabolism, were significantly up- or down- regulated. Gene network analysis indicates that the most enriched pathways are related to ERα. Notably, Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), a gene encoding a mitochondrial deacetylase important in cellular energetic and stress responses, was implicated in the next generation sequencing data and confirmed by qPCR to be up-regulated in the Tam-resistant cells, suggesting that SIRT3 is a potential important player in the regulation of tamoxifen resistance. The results of the current study may uncover previously unrecognized genes and molecular pathways that contribute to Tam resistance. Analysis of the deep sequencing data, identification, and validation of other potential Tam resistance-associated genes are still in progress. Our study suggests that comparative analysis of transcriptomes has the potential to help identify new targets that can be exploited to modulate sensitivity of breast cancer cells to this clinically useful anti-estrogen agent.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/71/8_Supplement/LB-378/574965/Abstract-LB-378-Transcriptome-analysis-of",""

As a result, it is common to adopt an effective one-component description of the structure that ignores the differences between particle types. Unfortunately, whether this kind of simplified description preserves or averages out information important for understanding the behavior of the fluid depends on the degree of polydispersity and can be difficult to assess, especially when the corresponding multicomponent description of the pair correlations is unavailable for comparison. Here, we present a computer simulation study that examines the implications of adopting an effective one-component structural description of a polydisperse fluid. The square-well model that we investigate mimics key aspects of the experimental behavior of suspended colloids with short-range, polymer-mediated attractions. To characterize the partial pair-correlation functions and thermodynamic excess entropy of this system, we introduce a Monte Carlo sampling strategy appropriate for fluids with a large number of pseudo-components. The data from our simulations at high particle concentrations, as well as exact theoretical results for dilute systems, show how qualitatively different trends between structural order and particle attractions emerge from the multicomponent and effective one-component treatments, even with systems characterized by moderate polydispersity. We examine consequences of these differences for excess-entropy based scalings of shear viscosity, and we discuss how use of the multicomponent treatment reveals similarities between the corresponding dynamic scaling behaviors of attractive colloids and liquid water that the effective one-component analysis does not capture.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.3643118/15443318/124513_1_online.pdf",""

Spanish derivations with diphthongizing stems may contain either the diphthong or the monophthong stem allomorph, but the likelihood of the (phonotactically marked) diphthong appearing is related to the productivity of the suffix. Prior data also indicate that this bias constrains the formal properties of possible, but as yet unattested derivations. Interestingly, the documented relevance of suffix productivity and stem phonotactics for lexical processing suggests a relationship between the processing characteristics of neologisms and their favored formal properties. Spanish diphthongization provides an ideal window on this relationship because the availability of either allomorph for any neologism allows us to compare the processing characteristics of the grammatically preferred and the dispreferred form. We present visual lexical decision results that confirm the systematic biases concerning Spanish diphthongization and shed light on their possible roots in processing. The results illuminate this long-standing conundrum in Spanish and point to a more general picture in which the impact of distributional properties of morphemes on processing can account for the current shape and dynamic evolution of the lexicon.","http://www.jbe-platform.com/deliver/fulltext/ml.6.3.01car.pdf",""

To successfully implement and use SSTs, it is important for the hospitality operators to understand the factors that determine both willingness and resistance of the customers on using the SSTs. Thus, the purpose of this study is to explore factors that affect customers’ willingness to embrace the usage of SSTs. Having a comprehensive understanding of customers behavior related to their demographic factors and readiness will promote successful implementation of new SSTs as well as effective modifications of existing SSTs. Structural equation modeling was conducted to test hypotheses with a sample of 614 consumers. The results indicate that consumers’ extrinsic motivation had the most significant impact on their likelihood of using new SSTs (e.g., kiosks and touch screen tables for ordering food or other services at hotels, casinos, and restaurants or pools), followed by intrinsic motivation and role clarity. Younger customers and those who do not believe having interactions with employees at hospitality settings is important were also more likely to use these SSTs.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1096348011407311",""

Recent studies suggest that glioma stem cells (GSCs) are responsible for the initiation, recurrence of gliomas, and resistance to radiological and chemotherapies, indicating that targeting GSCs is a more effective therapeutic strategy against gliomas. However, it is still unclear about the molecular mechanisms that govern GSC biology. TGF-beta and IL-1beta are both highly active in high grade gliomas and their elevated activities have been associated with poor prognosis in glioma patients. The link between TGF-beta and IL-1beta and malignant phenotype of gliomas suggests that TGF-beta and IL-1beta may contribute to glioma stem cell development. To test the hypothesis, we explored human glioma cell line LN229 and the serum-free condition. The serum-free condition supplemented with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) has been commonly used to identify GSCs, which readily form spheres, called ""glioma spheres"". However, LN229 cells cannot form spheres in serum-free medium, suggesting that these cells contain very few stem cells. We found that addition of IL-1beta and TGF-beta, but not either cytokine alone, to the serum-free medium resulted in sphere formation of LN229 cells even at clonal density, indicating that the two cytokines act in a synergistic fashion to induce self-renewal. Immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated that most IL-1beta/TGF-beta-induced sphere cells were nestin-positive cells. In addition, quantative PCR analyses showed that the induced spheres had significantly increased expression of other stemness markers including LIF, Notch-2 and Bmi-1. To further validate the self-renewal of the induced spheres, sphere cells were dissociated and plated in the absence of the cytokines in soft agar. The sphere cells formed more and larger colonies than the control cells by about two fold in number and size. Furthermore, the induced sphere cells demonstrated significantly increased invasion and drug resistance. Meanwhile, the gene expression of invasion-related genes including SIP1, beta-integrin and N-cadherin were also highly increased in the induced spheres compared to the control. More importantly, the induced sphere cells demonstrated their oncogenic potential by forming larger tumor with less number of cells in the brain of immunocompromised mice than the control cells. Overall, these results indicate that the spheres induced by IL-1beta and TGF-beta are cancer stem-like cells with the properties of self-renewal, drug resistance, invasion and oncogenic potential. Our finding suggests that GSCs can be a dynamic stage and microenvironmental conditions can promote the acquisition of a stem cell-like state from differentiated cells.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/71/8_Supplement/LB-98/575287/Abstract-LB-98-Reprogramming-towards-glioma-stem",""

Aside to their strength and ductility, magnesium alloys still need a major improvement to be studied before they can be considered as lightweight materials in automotive industries. That improvement is in fact developing the best thermo-mechanical processing approach considering several aspects of the microstructure and modeling and optimization of the deformation process. The objective of this study is to establish such a constitutive model and using this model to effectively obtain the optimum loading path and processing temperature to avoid local thinning and rupture of the material.

Third, the physical, social, psychological, and moral/ethical safety of the prison must be improved so that individuals can concentrate on change rather than mere survival. Fourth, the evidence supporting rehabilitative programming should be consulted, but, in addition, a more nuanced measure of success should also be considered. Finally, it is necessary to understand the barriers to improving prisons, including the vested interests that profit from the “prison-industrial complex,” public opinion, and budgetary restraints.

He had a discoid lupus rash and diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis. Serum complement analysis of the patient showed zero CH50 activity, undetectable C1r, and reduced levels of C1s, but highly elevated levels of complement C4, C2, and C1-inhibitor. The coding regions of the mutant C1R gene with 11 exons located at chromosome 12p13 were polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified and sequenced to completion. DNA sequencing revealed a homozygous C→T mutation at nucleotide-6392 in exon 10 of the C1R gene, resulting in a nonsense mutation from Arg-380 (R380X). The patient’s clinically normal mother was heterozygous for this mutation. A sequence-specific primer (SSP) PCR coupled with StuI-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was developed to detect the novel mutation.

Three fibroblast lines were obtained from each of wide type C57BL/6 and CTGF transgenic C57BL/6, and were transfected with Sparc siRNA or Ctgf siRNA. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting were used to examine the transcription and protein levels of type I collagen, CTGF and SPARC.

Our results showed that Col1a2 and Ctgf increased expression at both transcriptional and translational levels in the fibroblasts from the Col1a2-CTGF transgenic mice compared with those in the fibroblasts from their normal wild-type littermate. The treatment with Sparc siRNA or Ctgf siRNA attenuated the mRNA and/or protein expression of the Col1a2, Ctgf and Sparc in these fibroblasts.

The solvent effect is described by the Generalized Kirkwood theory. The CG model is calibrated using the results of all-atom simulations of model compounds in solution. Instead of matching the overall effective forces produced by atomic models, the fundamental intermolecular forces such as electrostatic, repulsion-dispersion, and solvation are represented explicitly at a CG level. We demonstrate that the CG alanine dipeptide model is able to reproduce quantitatively the conformational energy of all-atom force fields in both gas and solution phases, including the electrostatic and solvation components. Replica exchange molecular dynamics and microsecond dynamic simulations of polyalanine of 5 and 12 residues reveal that the CG polyalanines fold into “alpha helix” and “beta sheet” structures. The 5-residue polyalanine displays a substantial increase in the “beta strand” fraction relative to the 12-residue polyalanine. The detailed conformational distribution is compared with those reported from recent all-atom simulations and experiments.

Patients at risk for MS often present with a single demyelinating event, typically called a “clinically isolated syndrome” (CIS). A CIS can occur in the brain, spinal cord (Acute Partial Transverse Myelitis, APTM), or optic nerve (Optic Neuritis, ON) at similar rates and present a challenging diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma. Stratifying CIS patients most likely to develop MS is a complicated process, but desirable since treatment with the appropriate immunomodulatory agents early in the disease course can delay long-term disability. Thus, a primary focus of our laboratory has been to develop a completely novel type of biomarker that can identify CIS patients that will develop MS. This unique biomarker is based on a pattern of antibody gene mutations (i.e. antibody gene signature or “AGS”) that is exclusive to B cells from the cerebrospinal fluid and brain lesions of MS patients that initially presented with either TM or ON. In fact, the AGS is consistently elevated in patients with one attack of ON that go on to develop definite MS, and can predict conversion to MS with 91% accuracy. More recently, we are testing the hypothesis that the AGS serves as a predictor for conversion to MS in CIS patients that present with TM. Preliminary data demonstrate that the AGS is also prevalent in CIS patients presenting with TM.","https://journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article/186/1_Supplement/47.18/45260/Comparison-of-antibody-gene-mutation-patterns-in",""

As such, the purpose of this descriptive study is to give an overview of these changes and how they will affect the assessment of African American children. A national sample of African American psychology professionals was surveyed, and the majority indicated that response to intervention (RTI) methodologies alone are not sufficient for special education placement.

Deletion of V1/V2 results in a spike with far more structural heterogeneity than is observed in the wild type, likely reflecting greatly enhanced gp120 protomer flexibility. A major difference between the two forms is a pronounced loss of mass from the “peak” of the native Env spike. The apparent loss of contact among three gp120 protomers likely accounts for the more open structure, heterogeneity in configuration, and previous observations that broadly neutralizing epitopes and reactive sites on other structural elements are more exposed in such constructs.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.01612-10",""

Using data from 214 firms, we examine the relation between material weakness (MW) disclosures and various IAF attributes and activities. Our results indicate that MW disclosures are negatively associated with the education level of the IAF and the extent to which the IAF incorporates quality assurance techniques into fieldwork, audits activities related to financial reporting, and monitors the remediation of previously identified control problems. The timing of Section 404 work and the nature of follow-up monitoring suggests that these aspects of IAF quality help prevent MWs from occurring. We find that MW disclosures are positively associated with the IAF practice of grading audit engagements and external-internal auditor coordination, suggesting that these activities increase the effectiveness of Section 404 compliance processes.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article-pdf/86/1/287/20272/accr_00000016.pdf",""

In this article, the authors investigate whether firms should spend more on research and development (R&D) and advertising in recessions. They propose that the effects of changes in firms’ R&D and advertising spending in recessions on profits and stock returns are contingent on their market share, financial leverage, and product-market profile (i.e., business-to-consumer goods, business-to-business services, business-to-business goods, or business-to-consumer services). They estimate the model using a panel of more than 10,000 firm-years of publicly listed U.S. firms from 1969 to 2008, during which there were seven recessions. Their results support the contingency approach. The authors compute the marginal effects, which show how the effects of changes in R&D and advertising spending in recessions vary across firms. The marginal effects provide evidence of inadequate spending (e.g., 98% of business-to-consumer goods firms underspend on R&D), proactivity (e.g., 96% of business-to-business services firms are at approximately the right levels on advertising). and excess spending (e.g., 92% of business-to-consumer services firms overspend on advertising). Using the authors’ approach and publicly available data, managers can estimate the effects of their firms’ and competitors’ R&D and advertising spending on profits and stock returns in recessions.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1509/jmkg.75.3.49",""

Volunteer undergraduate and graduate music majors ( N = 60) listened to Mozart’s Variations (12) for Piano in C Major on ‘Ah vous dirai-je maman’, K 265 while manipulating a computer mouse. The cursor on the screen could be moved horizontally along a continuum to indicate focus of attention to either melody or harmony while simultaneously moving along a vertical axis tracking the amount of musical tension being perceived by the listener. Overall, as listeners attended more to harmony, their perception of tension appeared to increase.

Drawing on theories of police legitimacy, we hypothesize the label will result in an abrupt-permanent increase in speeding citation contestation rates, despite the fact that the billboard actually increases predictability of citation issuance. Results of an interrupted time-series analysis indicate statistically significant abrupt-permanent increases in the speeding citation contestation rates for the intervention city. Further analyses reveal that significant intervention effects are confined to drivers with higher opportunity to contest tickets (in-state drivers) and to majority subgroups (Whites and men).

After controlling for these sex differences, online communication attitudes predict everyday talk across specific media.

One of these challenges is variation, resulting in deviations in the behavior of transistors, most importantly in switching delays. These exaggerated delays widen the gap between the average and the worst case behavior of a circuit. Conventionally, circuits are designed to accommodate the worst case delay and are therefore becoming very limited in their performance advantages. Thus, allowing for an average case oriented design is a promising solution, maintaining the pace of performance improvement over future generations. However, to maintain correctness, such an approach will require on the fly mechanisms to prevent, detect, and resolve violations. This paper explores such mechanisms, allowing the improvement of circuit performance under intensifying variations. We present speculative error detection techniques along with recovery mechanisms. We continue by discussing their ability to operate under extreme variations including sub-threshold operation. While the main focus of this survey is on circuit approaches, for its completeness, we discuss higher-level, architectural and algorithmic techniques as well.","https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9268/1/3/334/pdf",""

In this report, we present evidence suggesting that NKA builds a maintains a Na+ gradient across the nuclear envelope (NE) membrane, extending our earlier observation that NKA functions within the Endoplasmic Reticulum (Gatto et al., AJP‐cell phys., 281, C982‐C992, 2001). Immunocytochemistry of isolated nuclei from HEK‐293 cells with commercially available alpha and beta antibodies revealed that NKA was located on the nuclear envelope. In addition, membrane preparations from isolated nuclei had ouabain‐sensitive ATPase activity. Moreover, immunostaining of nuclei with antibodies against the Na/Ca‐exchanger (NCX) and NKA reveals an overlap between localization of nuclear NKA and NCX (Na/Ca‐exchanger). Given that NCX is driven by a Na+ gradient, we propose that the intracellular NKA function is utilized by NCX to extrude Ca2+ from the nucleus. We measured NKA function in isolated HEK cell nuclei via CoroNa green fluorescence. We observed an ATP‐dependent, strophanthidin‐sensitive Na accumulation in the nuclear envelope loaded with the Na‐sensitive dye. Analogous experiments are underway utilizing Ca‐sensitive probes.

This is tested by analyzing the contributions of three soil moisture–related signals—a seasonal signal, an along-track rainfall signal, and an early postlandfall rainfall signal—to the intensity of the vortex. In so doing, a suite of nine convection-permitting numerical simulations using the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF-ARW) is used. Of the signals tested, soil moisture contributions from the anomalously wet months preceding Erin are found to have the greatest positive impact upon the intensity of the vortex, though this impact is on the order of that from climatological soil moisture conditions. The greatest impact of the early rainfall signal contributions is found when it is added to the seasonal signal. Along-track rainfall during the simulation period has a minimal impact.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/mwr/article-pdf/139/12/3848/4267100/2011mwr3593_1.pdf",""

T-UCRs are differentially expressed in colorectal cancer, leukemia and neuroblastoma, however their expression in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has not been studied. We used qPCR to profile all 482 T-UCRs in a variety of pancreatic cancer specimens including pancreatic adenocarcinoma, chronic pancreatitis and benign/normal pancreas and in the pancreas of genetically engineered mice (P48+/Cre;LSL-KRASG12D and PDX-1-Cre;LSL-KRASG12D). Of the 257 expressed T-UCRs in the human pancreas tissues, 166 were differentially expressed in the PDAC compared to normal and adjacent benign pancreas (≥ 1.5 fold; p &lt; 0.05). In the genetically engineered mice, 29% of the expressed T-UCRs were differentially expressed in the pancreas of old P48+/Cre;LSL-KRASG12D mice (mean age, 231 days) compared to control. In both the patient and mouse data, the vast majority of the differentially expressed T-UCRs increased with disease progression. Interestingly, the expression pattern among groups of two T-UCRs closely correlated with each other. This was to be expected for T-UCRs directly adjacent to one another in the genome, but surprisingly we found strong correlations among T-UCRs that are located on different chromosomes. This suggests that large groups of T-UCRs are co-expressed in PDAC. In vitro models that simulate the desmoplastic reaction have been shown it to alter gene expression in PDAC. In an effort to understand the mechanism responsible for this global increase in expression in PDAC, the T-UCRs were profiled in normal pancreas (HPDE) cells that were cultured on the extracellular matrix deposited by Panc-1 cells. Ninety-one T-UCRs were increased in the HPDE co-cultures (fold-change &gt; 1.5, p&lt; 0.05). We report a global increase in the T-UCR expression in PDAC tissues, the pancreas of genetically engineered mice and in HPDE cells co-cultured with Panc-1 cells. The ability of the MAP kinase and TGF-β signaling pathways to regulate T-UCR expression will be investigated in the future.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/71/8_Supplement/1179/569765/Abstract-1179-Global-increase-in-ultraconserved",""

First, because firms use warranty policies as a business strategy to promote their products, a warranty reserve can serve two roles: an information signal regarding product quality, as well as a contingent liability. Consistent with this view, we find that the stock market recognizes that: (1) the warranty reserve contains information about firms’ future performance, and (2) the reserve is a liability. Second, because warranty accruals require estimation of future claims, they can be used as a tool of earnings management. Our evidence indicates that managers use warranty accruals to manage earnings opportunistically to meet earnings targets. Finally, we find that the stock market recognizes the understatement of warranty liabilities of firms that managed earnings.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article-pdf/86/2/569/20334/accr_00000021.pdf",""

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cooperative Groups may offer a viable platform to perform such research. Observational, preventive, and behavioral research can often be performed within the cooperative group setting, especially if resources needed for evaluation are fairly simple, if protocols are easily implemented within the typical clinical setting, and if interventions are well standardized. Some protocols are better suited to cooperative groups than are others, and there are advantages and disadvantages to conducting survivorship research within the cooperative group setting. Behavioral researchers currently involved in cooperative groups, as well as program staff within the NCI, can serve as sources of information for those wishing to pursue symptom management and survivorship studies within the clinical trial setting. The structure of the cooperative groups is currently changing, but going forward, survivorship is bound to be a topic of interest and one that perhaps may be more easily addressed using the proposed more centralized structure.

In this study, we examine the impact of packaged software upgrades from the perspectives of IS staff and IS users. A dual case study was conducted to understand the impacts of an SAP upgrade and a Windows upgrade. Our study shows that there are two essential costs in each upgrade, the cost of implementation and the costs of users’ learning. Moreover, not all users experience positive impacts from software upgrade. Users’ experience of beneficial impact is contingent upon users’ explicit adoption of useful new features and improvement in features that users use.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1057/jit.2011.1",""

Participants in a web-based survey ( N = 381) completed measures of relationship qualities and recorded responses to five hypothetical scenarios that described their romantic partner delivering a potentially hurtful message. As anticipated, relationship uncertainty and interference from a partner predicted increased relational turbulence, whereas facilitation from a partner was associated with less turbulence; relational turbulence significantly predicted all three reactions to hurtful messages.

The research was guided by symbolic interactionism and the work of Erving Goffman. Data were collected via in-depth interviews with 14 married couples expecting their first child. Analyses revealed that wives and husbands negotiated meanings relative to recapturing, redefining, and reclaiming wives’ bodies after childbirth in a way that suggested a repertoire of possible selves, including the Woman I/My Wife Used to Be (before pregnancy), the Woman I Fear I/My Wife Could Become (i.e., a woman who cannot get her old shape back), and the Women I/My Wife Hope(s) to Become (i.e., a woman who can get her old shape back) (cf. Guy & Banim, 2000). Within this general system of meanings, three overarching themes emerged: (a) aspirations for the postpartum body, (b) the navigation of concerns relative to the appearance of the postpartum body, and (c) reclamation projects planned and/or undertaken by wives. In varied ways, interactions within the marital dyad shaped the wives’ efforts to navigate their concerns about the postpartum body and to plan or undertake bodily reclamation projects. Generally speaking, husband-wife interactions were described by wives as a source of reassurance in the journey back to The Women They Used to Be.

There are also unique types of costs (e.g., parental costs, peer costs) with differential impacts. Salience exerts a main effect, but there was little evidence to suggest it interacts with costs.

The small number of Hispanic faculty, combined with the lack of Hispanic role models and mentors, perpetuates a troublesome cycle of underrepresentation in STEM fields. In 2004, seven Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) formed the Computing Alliance of Hispanic-Serving Institutions (CAHSI) to consolidate their strengths, resources, and concerns with the aim of increasing the number of Hispanics who pursue and complete baccalaureate and advanced degrees in computing areas. To address barriers that hinder students from advancing, CAHSI defined a number of initiatives, based on programs that produced promising results at one or more institutions. These included the following: a CS-0 course that focuses on adoption of a three-unit pre-CS course that uses graphics and animation to engage and prepare students who have no prior experience in computing; a peer mentoring strategy that provides an active, collaborative learning experience for students while creating leadership roles for undergraduates; an undergraduate and graduate student research model that emphasizes the deliberate and intentional development of technical, team, and professional skills and knowledge required for research and cooperative work; and a mentoring framework for engaging undergraduates in experiences and activities that prepare them for graduate studies and onto the professoriate. CAHSI plays a critical role in evaluating, documenting, and disseminating effective practices that achieve its mission. This paper provides an overview of CAHSI initiatives and describes how each addresses causes of underrepresentation of Hispanics in computing. In addition, it describes the evaluation and assessment of the initiatives and presents the results that support CAHSI’s claim of their effectiveness.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2037276.2037280",""

Although CT (Computerized Tomography) has been used for characterizing rocks and visualizing and quantifying multiphase flow through rocks for over 25 years, most of the scanning is done at a voltage setting above 100 kV for taking advantage of the Compton scattering (CS) effect, which responds to density changes. Below 100 kV the photoelectric effect (PE) is dominant which responds to the effective atomic numbers (Zeff), which is directly related to the photo electric factor. Using the combination of the two effects helps in better characterization of reservoir rocks. The most common technique for dual energy CT-scanning relies on homogeneous calibration standards to produce the most accurate decoupled data. However, the use of calibration standards with impurities increases the probability of error in the reconstructed data and results in poor rock characterization. This work combines ICP-OES (inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy) and LIBS (laser induced breakdown spectroscopy) analytical techniques to quantify the type and level of impurities in a set of commercially purchased calibration standards used in dual-energy scanning. The Zeff data on the calibration standards with and without impurity data were calculated using the weighted linear combination of the various elements present and used in calculating Zeff using the dual energy technique. Results show 2 to 5% difference in predicted Zeff values which may affect the corresponding log calibrations. The effect that these techniques have on improving material identification data is discussed and analyzed. The workflow developed in this paper will translate to a more accurate material identification estimates for unknown samples and improve calibration of well logging tools.","http://onepetro.org/SPEATCE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/146522-MS/1665563/spe-146522-ms.pdf",""

The assimilation strategy includes a mechanism to select the radiance observations that are assimilated at a given grid point and an ensemble-based observation bias-correction technique. Numerical experiments are carried out with a reduced (T62L28) resolution version of the model component of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS). The observations used for the evaluation of the assimilation strategy are AMSU-A level 1B brightness temperature data from the Earth Observing System (EOS) Aqua spacecraft. The assimilation of these observations, in addition to all operationally assimilated nonradiance observations, leads to a statistically significant improvement of both the temperature and wind analysis in the Southern Hemisphere.

Methods: This study retrospectively reviewed 26 axillary nerve injuries associated with sports between the years 1985 and 2010. Preoperative status of the axillary nerve was evaluated by using the Louisiana State University Health Science Center (LSUHSC) grading system published by the senior authors. Intraoperative nerve action potential recordings were performed to check nerve conduction and assess the possibility of resection. Neurolysis, suture, and nerve grafts were used for the surgical repair of the injured nerves. In 9 patients with partial loss of function and 3 with complete loss, neurolysis based on nerve action potential recordings was the primary treatment. Two patients with complete loss of function were treated with resection and suturing and 12 with resection and nerve grafting. The minimum follow-up period was 16 months (mean 20 months). Results: The injuries were associated with the following sports: skiing (12 cases), football (5), rugby (2), baseball (2), ice hockey (2), soccer (1), weightlifting (1), and wrestling (1). Functional recovery was excellent. Neurolysis was performed in 9 cases, resulting in an average functional recovery of LSUHSC Grade 4.2. Recovery with graft repairs averaged LSUHSC Grade 3 or better in 11 of 12 cases Conclusions: Surgical repair can restore useful deltoid function in patients with sports-associated axillary nerve injuries, even in cases of severe stretch–contusion injury.","https://thejns.org/downloadpdf/journals/neurosurg-focus/31/5/2011.8.focus11183.xml",""

Thus, strategies that improve the efficiency of feed utilization are needed to improve the global competitiveness of Israeli and U.S. cattle industries, and mitigate their environmental impact through reductions in nutrient excretions and greenhouse gas emissions. Implementation of innovative technologies that will enhance genetic merit for feed efficiency is arguably one of the most cost-effective strategies to meet future demands for animal-protein foods in an environmentally sustainable manner. While considerable genetic variation in feed efficiency exist within cattle populations, the expense of measuring individual-animal feed intake has precluded implementation of selection programs that target this trait. Residual feed intake (RFI) is a trait that quantifies between-animal variation in feed intake beyond that expected to meet energy requirements for maintenance and production, with efficient animals being those that eat less than expected for a given size and level of production. There remains a critical need to understand the biological drivers for genetic variation in RFI to facilitate development of effective selection programs in the future. Therefore, the aim of this project was to determine the biological basis for phenotypic variation in RFI of growing and lactating cattle, and discover metabolic biomarkers of RFI for early and more cost-effective selection of cattle for feed efficiency. Objectives were to: (1) Characterize the phenotypic relationships between RFI and production traits (growth or lactation), (2) Quantify inter-animal variation in residual HP, (3) Determine if divergent RFIphenotypes differ in HP, residual HP, recovered energy and digestibility, and (4) Determine if divergent RFI phenotypes differ in physical activity, feeding behavior traits, serum hormones and metabolites and hepatic mitochondrial traits. The major research findings from this project to date include: In lactating dairy cattle, substantial phenotypic variation in RFI was demonstrated as cows classified as having low RMEI consumed 17% less MEI than high-RMEI cows despite having similar body size and lactation productivity. Further, between-animal variation in RMEI was found to moderately associated with differences in RHP demonstrating that maintenance energy requirements contribute to observed differences in RFI. Quantifying energetic efficiency of dairy cows using RHP revealed that substantial changes occur as week of lactation advances—thus it will be critical to measure RMEI at a standardized stage of lactation. Finally, to determine RMEI in lactating dairy cows, individual DMI and production data should be collected for a minimum of 6 wk. We demonstrated that a favorably association exists between RFI in growing heifers and efficiency of forage utilization in pregnant cows. Therefore, results indicate that female progeny from parents selected for low RFI during postweaning development will also be efficient as mature females, which has positive implications for both dairy and beef cattle industries. Results from the beef cattle studies further extend our knowledge regarding the biological drivers of phenotypic variation in RFI of growing animals, and demonstrate that significant differences in feeding behavioral patterns, digestibility and heart rate exist between animals with divergent RFI. Feeding behavior traits may be an effective biomarker trait for RFI in beef and dairy cattle. There are differences in mitochondrial acceptor control and respiratory control ratios between calves with divergent RFI suggesting that variation in mitochondrial metabolism may be visible at the genome level. Multiple genes associated with mitochondrial energy processes are altered by RFI phenotype and some of these genes are associated with mitochondrial energy expenditure and major cellular pathways involved in regulation of immune responses and energy metabolism.</p>","",""

More recently, CD74 has been implicated as having a role in cancer development by its mediating the prosurvival signaling of the ligand macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) stimulation and it's associated higher level expression in chemoresistant cancers. Blocking of CD74, the receptor for MIF, or its downstream target, a4b1 integrin has been reported to block the homing of CLL cells to bone marrow. The hLL1 antibody (Milatuzumab; Immunomedics, Inc, Morris Plains, NJ) shows promising anti-cancer activity, with eradiation of lymphoma and myeloma xenografts in mice through an undefined mechanism of action. Because of this apparent central role in cancer development, we examined CLL cells of patients (pts) treated with humanized anti-CD74 antibody hLL1. Study Design:: Adults with relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or CLL, who had at least one prior therapy, were enrolled on this phase I-II trial. Patient criteria; ANC 1000, hemoglobin 9, platelets 50,000, adequate organ function, ECOG performance of 1–2, provided informed consent. The hLL1 antibody, in 4 or 8 mg/kg dosages, was administered intravenously over 4 hours, two or three times per wk for 4 wks. Results:: Seven pts (4 male) with a median age 65 (range 57–72) with a median 2 (range 1–4) prior chemotherapy treatments were enrolled. Histologies included showed 1 pts with large B cell lymphoma, 5 with pts with SLL/CLL (5) and 1 with marginal zone lymphoma. All pts completed therapy except one who received 5 of 8 doses of planned therapy; 2 pts received dose escalated hLL1 at 8 mg/kg. The hLL1 was well-tolerated with some infusion related side effects, which responded to medications. All other patients maintained adequate hematologic indices, which did not prevent completing the initial therapy plan. Tumor responses were: one partial response, 1 progression, 1 non-evaluable, and 4 with stable disease. Pts' tumor cells were analyzed by reverse-phase protein analysis for activation status of 120 signaling proteins. In 4 of 4 pts with CLL, hLL1 therapy was associated with consistently lower phosphorylated levels of Akt T308 and Notch3; but whether this effect was caused by other concurrent medications could not be ruled out. All the pts who had elevated lymphocyte counts (with bone marrow involvement) showed a rise in lymphocyte counts (Figure) during treatment with hLL1 therapy and then returned to baseline or below baseline after completing infusion. Interestingly, the blocking of CD74 has been shown to interfere with the homing of CLL cells to bone marrow through the binding of CD74-dependent a4b1 integrin. The binding of CLL a4b1 integrin to stroma is a potent cell survival stimulus. To ascertain this mechanisms of CD74 hLL1 antibody induced release of lymphocytes, we analyzed migration of CLL cells in transwell towards MIF. CLL cells without hLL1 exposure had a 2–3 fold cell number migration towards MIF indicating these cells have an intact CD74 receptor mechanism. This analysis suggests that hLL1 targets CLL cells in vivo and interferes with homing of CLL. Follow up analyses will examine whether CLL cells of hLL1-treated pts downregulate a4b1 integrin mediate binding and alter binding to bone marrow stroma. Uncovering such actions are important steps in the elucidation of hLL1's mechanisms of action and for the development of targeted therapies for hematopoietic cancers.

The separation experiments were conducted using a laboratory centrifuge and 2 in. hydrocyclones. The laboratory centrifuge was able to separate the riser mud into near ideal densities for dilution and drilling fluid. However, the dense slurry retained in the centrifuge had lower electrical stability than the feed stream. The hydrocyclones achieved much less contrast in density between the low and high density discharges, but their use consistently resulted in a beneficial increase in the stability of the mud emulsion in all of the flow streams and gave more desirable rheological properties. A qualitative comparison indicates that the hydrocyclone separation system may offer a feasible and desirable alternative to a centrifuge separation system.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/energyresources/article-pdf/doi/10.1115/1.4004968/5887776/031501_1.pdf",""

In light of other countries’ policies and current operational considerations, senior military leaders sought to understand the effects of existing policy on a low-density, high-value occupational specialty, the combat medic. The authors found evidence that male medics deployed 2.07 times more frequently than female medics. The authors also found evidence that senior male medics (staff sergeants) deployed even more frequently (3.65–1) than their female counterparts. Perhaps as a result, the male combat medics experience higher likelihood of promotion from staff sergeant (E-6) to the rank of sergeant first class (E-7); however, the magnitude of that benefit was about one-third of the deployment risk. The results confirm the existence of gender-based deployment risk and promotion disparity.

Drawing on an analysis of state laws, we identify considerable variation in the type, intensity, and design of sex crime laws among states.

Previous hypotheses have linked cooperation and inequity responses. Supporting this, all species in which inequity responses have been documented are cooperative. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by investigating the response to inequity in squirrel monkeys, which share a phylogenetic family with capuchin monkeys, but do not cooperate extensively. Subjects exchanged tokens to receive food rewards in conditions in which the level of effort required and reward received varied. Squirrel monkeys did not respond negatively to inequity. However, the monkeys were sensitive to the variation present in the task; male subjects showed a contrast effect and, as in previous studies, subjects were more sensitive to differences in reward in the context of a task than when rewards were given for free. Taken with other results, these results support the hypothesis that a negative response to inequity evolved convergently in primates, probably as a mechanism for evaluating outcomes relative to one's partners in cooperative species.","https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsbl.2011.0211",""

Results confirmed that the bag is stable and well grounded for most operational sea conditions. Large amplitude and low frequency waves can induce significant motions of the structure, but the static and dynamic frictional coefficients between the structure and the surface in contact play a critical role in these motions. For conditions where the structure was at an angle of 45° to the incident waves, highly nonlinear wave conditions are produced which created wave over-topping and oscillatory motions of the structure.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/OMAE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/OMAE2011-49101/4574863/55_1.pdf",""

Tradeoffs in complexity and jitter tracking performance of common per-channel de-skew circuits are discussed, along with how band-pass filtering can be leveraged to provide additional jitter filtering at the receiver. Jitter tolerance analysis for a 10 Gb/s system shows that a near all-pass delay-locked loop (DLL) and phase-interpolator- (PI-) based de-skew performs best under low skew conditions, while, at high skew, architectures which leverage band-pass clock filtering or a phase-locked loop (PLL) for increased jitter filtering are more suitable.

There are several forces that cause protein degradation, including amino acid racemization, protein deamidation, and protein truncation. The purpose of this paper is to study protein deamidation using matrix‐assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI‐MS) for high‐throughput dating of museums wool specimens. For proof of concept, several well‐dated sheep's wool textiles from museum collections were analyzed. For wool samples aged from the present to ~400 years ago, the deamidation of two asparagine‐containing peptides obtained from the tryptic digest of sheep wool were found to behave linearly in time, indicating that they could act as a potential biomarker of aging for wool samples.

This paper presents a flexible approach and framework that can equip transportation agencies with the tools required to understand what sustainability means and incorporate sustainability into the organizational culture. This approach and method can also help agencies lay the groundwork for the use of performance measures so the agencies can progress toward sustainability goals and outcomes. The framework development process was an extension of findings from literature review, case studies, and interviews conducted as part of ongoing research under the NCHRP project Sustainability Performance Measures for State Departments of Transportation and Other Transportation Agencies. The proposed framework can be applied or adapted for use in a range of transportation agencies, including state departments of transportation and metropolitan planning organizations. A key feature of this framework is that it moves away from the traditional sustainable transportation perspective and instead promotes the consideration of transportation from a holistic sustainable development perspective. The framework defines broadly applicable transportation goals that can be broken down into a menu of objectives and performance measures to cover various transportation contexts. The framework is also designed to direct an agency's strategic planning toward the practical implementation of sustainability through performance measurement.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/2242-02",""

The therapeutic antibody trastuzumab, an approved therapy for HER2+ breast cancer, cannot block ligand-induced HER2 heterodimers, suggesting it cannot effectively inhibit HER2 signaling. Hence, HER2 oligomeric states may predict the odds of a clinical response to trastuzumab in HER2-driven tumors. To test this hypothesis, we generated nontransformed human MCF10A mammary epithelial cells stably expressing a chimeric HER2–FKBP molecule that could be conditionally induced to homodimerize by adding the FKBP ligand AP1510, or instead induced to heterodimerize with EGFR or HER3 by adding the heterodimer ligands EGF/TGFα or heregulin. AP1510, EGF, and heregulin each induced growth of MCF10A cells expressing HER2–FKBP. Trastuzumab inhibited homodimer-mediated but not heterodimer-mediated cell growth. In contrast, the HER2 antibody pertuzumab, which blocks HER2 heterodimerization, inhibited growth induced by heregulin but not AP1510. Lastly, the HER2/EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib blocked both homodimer- and heterodimer-induced growth. AP1510 triggered phosphorylation of Erk1/2 but not AKT, whereas trastuzumab inhibited AP1510-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation and Shc-HER2 homodimer binding, but not TGFα-induced AKT phosphorylation. Consistent with these observations, high levels of HER2 homodimers correlated with longer time to progression following trastuzumab therapy in a cohort of patients with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. Together, our findings confirm the notion that HER2 oligomeric states regulate HER2 signaling, also arguing that trastuzumab sensitivity of homodimers may reflect their inability to activate the PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/AKT pathway. A clinical implication of our results is that high levels of HER2 homodimers may predict a positive response to trastuzumab.

Recent advances in genomics have allowed further evaluation of the source of microbial methane, through the use of high-throughput phylogenetic sequencing and fluorescent in situ hybridization, to describe the diversity and abundance of bacteria and methanogenic archaea in these subsurface formations. However, the anaerobic metabolism of the bacteria breaking coal down to methanogenic substrates, the likely rate-limiting step in biogenic gas production, is not fully understood. Coal molecules are more recalcitrant to biodegradation with increasing thermal maturity, and progress has been made in identifying some of the enzymes involved in the anaerobic degradation of these recalcitrant organic molecules using metagenomic studies and culture enrichments. In recent years, researchers have attempted lab and subsurface stimulation of the naturally slow process of methanogenic degradation of coal.","https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-earth-040610-133343",""

These processes are frequently coordinated by the activities of various signaling pathways such as Notch signaling. From a screen for modifiers of Notch signaling in Drosophila we have identified the RNA helicase Belle, a recently described component of the RNA interference pathway, as an important regulator of the timing of Notch activity in follicle cells. We found that loss of Belle delays activation of Notch signaling, which results in delayed follicle cell differentiation and defects in the cell cycle. Because mutations in well-characterized microRNA components phenocopied the Notch defects observed in belle mutants, Belle might be functioning in the microRNA pathway in follicle cells. The effect of loss of microRNAs on Notch signaling occurs upstream of Notch cleavage, as expression of the constitutively active intracellular domain of Notch in microRNA-defective cells restored proper activation of Notch. Furthermore, we present evidence that the Notch ligand Delta is an important target of microRNA regulation in follicle cells and regulates the timing of Notch activation through cis inhibition of Notch. Here we have uncovered a complex regulatory process in which the microRNA pathway promotes Notch activation by repressing Delta-mediated inhibition of Notch in follicle cells.","http://journals.biologists.com/dev/article-pdf/138/9/1737/1572132/1737.pdf",""

The model structure takes the form of a multilevel hazard-based model system that accounts for the range of interactions and spatial effects that might affect walking and bicycling mode use. In addition to the individual-specific factors, family (household-specific) interactions, social group (peer) influences, and spatial clustering effects are considered potential factors that contribute to heterogeneity in nonmotorized transport mode use behavior. The model system presented is capable of accommodating grouped duration responses often encountered in activity–travel surveys.

Understanding the factors controlling these processes may have important therapeutic potential for BM failure and cancers. Here, we show that Skp2, a component of the Skp2 SCF complex, is an important regulator for HSC quiescence, frequency, and self-renewal capability. Skp2 deficiency displays a marked enhancement of HSC populations through promoting cell cycle entry independently of its role on apoptosis. Surprisingly, Skp2 deficiency in HSCs reduces quiescence and displays increased HSC cycling and proliferation. Importantly, loss of Skp2 not only increases HSC populations and long-term reconstitution ability but also rescues the defect in long-term reconstitution ability of HSCs on PTEN inactivation. Mechanistically, we show that Skp2 deficiency induces Cyclin D1 gene expression, which contributes to an increase in HSC cycling. Finally, we demonstrate that Skp2 deficiency enhances sensitivity of Lin− Sca-1+ c-kit+ cells and leukemia cells to chemotherapy agents. Our findings show that Skp2 is a novel regulator for HSC quiescence and self-renewal and that targeting Skp2 may have therapeutic implications for BM transplantation and leukemia stem cell treatment.","http://ashpublications.org/blood/article-pdf/118/20/5429/1345857/zh804611005429.pdf",""

Using self-esteem conditioning (Experiment 1) and outgroup stereotype priming (Experiment 2), it was found that people were more susceptible to subtle change inductions as objective self-ambivalence increased. Notably, the consistency between dominant self-views (positive or negative) and the change induction did not influence these results.

After reviewing relevant theory and previous studies, we analyze data from a nationwide sample of Presbyterian Church (USA) members to test the hypothesis that religious doubts will be inversely associated with overall self-rated sleep quality, and positively associated with the frequency of sleep problems and the use of sleep medications. We also hypothesize that part of this association will be explained by the link between religious doubts and psychological distress. Results offer moderate but consistent support for these predictions.

In the chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), transgenerational transfer of egg yolk factors may set the stage for morphological and physiological phenotypic differences observed among breeds. To investigate the effect of breed-specific yolk composition on embryonic broiler and layer chicken phenotypes, we employed an ex ovo, xenobiotic technique that allowed the transfer of broiler and layer chicken embryos from their natural yolks to novel yolk environments. Embryonic day two broiler embryos developing on broiler yolk culture medium (YCM) had significantly higher heart rates than layer embryos developing on layer YCM (176±7 beats min–1 and 147±7 beats min–1, respectively). Broiler embryos developing on layer YCM exhibited heart rates typical of layer embryos developing normally on layer YCM. However, layer embryo heart rates were not affected by development on broiler YCM. Unlike O2 consumption, development rate and body mass of embryos were significantly affected by exposure to different yolk types, with both broiler and layer embryos displaying traits that reflected yolk source rather than embryo genotype. Analysis of hormone concentrations of broiler and layer egg yolks revealed that testosterone concentrations were higher in broiler yolk (4.63±2.02 pg mg–1vs 3.32±1.92 pg mg–1), whereas triiodothyronine concentrations were higher in layer yolk (1.05±0.18 pg mg–1vs 0.46±0.22 pg mg–1). Thus, a complex synergistic effect of breed-specific genotype and yolk environment exists early in chicken development, with yolk thyroid hormone and yolk testosterone as potential mediators of the physiological and morphological effects.","http://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article-pdf/214/4/619/1440939/619.pdf",""

The nanocomposite structures vary from triangular domains, to vertically aligned columns, and finally to smaller spherical domains as the deposition frequency varies from 1, 5, to 10 Hz, respectively. The strain in LSMO is systematically tuned, but that of the Mn3O4 phase is relatively stable as the deposition frequency increases. The tunable strain is found directly related to the different domain and grain boundary (GB) structures. Physical properties including saturation magnetization, Curie temperature (TC), magnetoresistance and metal–insulator transition temperature (TMI), all show systematic trends as the deposition frequency varies. This study reveals that the domain/GBs tunability achieved in nanocomposite thin films can affect the lattice strain and further tune their ferromagnetic properties.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.3552594/14927532/054302_1_online.pdf",""

However, the immune responses induced are generally weak. Previously, we showed that the antibody responses induced by topical DNA vaccine are significantly enhanced when hair follicles in the application area are induced into the anagen (growth) stage by hair plucking. In the present study, we further investigated the mechanism of immune enhancement. Methods: Three different methods – hair plucking or treatment with retinoic acid (RA) or O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) – were used to induce mice hair follicles into the anagen stage before they were dosed with a β-galactosidase-encoding plasmid, and the specific antibody responses induced were evaluated. Key findings: The hair-plucking method was more effective at enhancing the resultant antibody responses. Treatment with RA or TPA caused more damage to the skin and induced more severe local inflammation than hair plucking. However, hair plucking was most effective at enhancing the uptake or retention of the DNA in the application area. Conclusions: The uptake of plasmid DNA in the application area correlated with the antibody responses induced by a topically applied DNA.","http://academic.oup.com/jpp/article-pdf/63/2/199/36354636/j.2042-7158.2010.01219.x.pdf",""

Characteristics of patients included median age, 71 years; sex, 57% females; PS 0 or 1, 88% of patients; and smoking status, 19% never-smokers. Central pathology review confirmed the diagnosis in 45 of 49 available specimens. Approximately 50% of patients received more than two cycles of therapy (> 8 weeks). Skin rash was the most common toxicity (grade 3, 15%). The confirmed response rate was 7%, and stable disease was observed in 35%. The median survival and progression-free survival were 13 and 3.3 months, respectively. Only one of the six patients with an EGFR mutation and one of the seven patients with a KRAS mutation had a partial response. Conclusion: Cetuximab was associated with modest efficacy in patients with advanced BAC, despite a low response rate. EGFR and KRAS mutations were not predictive of response to cetuximab.","https://ascopubs.org/doi/pdfdirect/10.1200/JCO.2010.33.4094",""

It is assumed that unlike antimicrobials, inhibition of QS should cause less Darwinian selection pressure for bacterial resistance. Using the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we demonstrate here that bacterial resistance arises rapidly to the best-characterized compound that inhibits QS (brominated furanone C-30) due to mutations that increase the efflux of C-30. Critically, the C-30-resistant mutant mexR was more pathogenic to Caenorhabditis elegans in the presence of C-30, and the same mutation arises in bacteria responsible for chronic cystic fibrosis infections. Therefore, bacteria may evolve resistance to many new pharmaceuticals thought impervious to resistance.","http://www.nature.com/articles/ismej2011122.pdf",""

The effects of S-albuterol are often the opposite of those of levalbuterol, and the effects of levalbuterol may be diminished in the presence of S-albuterol. Objective:: To compare exposures among young children to levalbuterol and albuterol that were reported to poison centers. Methods:: Cases included levalbuterol and albuterol exposures among patients age 0–5 years reported to Texas poison centers during 2000–2009. The distribution of total cases for each medication was determined for selected characteristics. For cases not involving other substances and where a final medical outcome was known, the distribution of each medication was determined for outcome and management site of the exposure and most common clinical effects and treatments. Comparisons were made by calculating the rate ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval. Results:: There were a total of 1,012 levalbuterol and 4,338 albuterol exposures. Other substances were involved in 11.8% of levalbuterol and 6.6% of albuterol exposures (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.20). No effect was reported in 84.0% of levalbuterol and 71.9% of albuterol exposures (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.32), and 91.7% of levalbuterol and 73.1% of albuterol exposures were managed on site (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.41). The most common adverse clinical effects were reported more frequently among albuterol exposures. The most frequent treatments of levalbuterol and albuterol exposures were, respectively, dilution 59.5% and 42.0% (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.64), food 18.9% and 12.8% (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.94), single-dose activated charcoal 0.3% and 10.1% (RR 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.15), and cathartic 0.0% and 4.6% (RR 0.00, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.22).

The M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2), which is responsible for catalyzing the final step of aerobic glycolysis, is highly expressed in cancer cells and may contribute to the Warburg effect. However, whether PKM2 plays a contributing role during early cancer development is unclear. In our studies, we have made an attempt to elucidate the effects of varying mitochondrial respiration substrates on skin cell transformation and expression of PKM2. Tumorigenicity in murine skin epidermal JB6 P+ (promotable) cells was measured in a soft agar assay using 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) as a tumor promoter. We observed a significant reduction in cell transformation upon pretreatment with the mitochondrial respiration substrate succinate or malate/pyruvate. We observed that increased expression and activity of PKM2 in TPA-treated JB6 P+ cells and pretreatment with succinate or malate/pyruvate suppressed the effects. In addition, TPA treatment also induced PKM2 whereas PKM1 expression was suppressed in mouse skin epidermal tissues in vivo. In comparison with JB6 P+ cells, the nonpromotable JB6 P− cells showed no increase in PKM2 expression or activity upon TPA treatment. Knockdown of PKM2 using a siRNA approach significantly reduced skin cell transformation. Thus, our results suggest that PKM2 activation could be an early event and play a contributing role in skin tumorigenesis.

This is accomplished by investigating the influence of several external parameters, such as temperature and moisture content, on the NC and conductance of the colloid as well as solid materials created from the nanoparticles used in the colloid. In addition to NC, the colloid demonstrates the electrorheological (ER) effect. It is shown that large scale particle motions, such as those that generate the ER effect, are not responsible for the NC. The results demonstrate that the nanoparticle surface conductivity is the relevant parameter to the NC in this system, effectively isolating the origin of the NC to nanoparticle surface.

Methods: The authors retrospectively reviewed the cases of peroneal nerve injury associated with sports between the years 1970 and 2010. Each patient was evaluated for injury mechanism, preoperative neurological status, electrophysiological studies, lesion type, and operative technique (neurolysis and graft repair). Preoperative status of injury was evaluated by using a grading system published by the senior authors. All lesions in continuity had intraoperative nerve action potential recordings. Results: Eighty-four (approximately 18%) of 448 cases of peroneal nerve injury were found to be sports related, which included skiing (42 cases), football (23 cases), soccer (8 cases), basketball (6 cases), ice hockey (2 cases), track (2 cases) and volleyball (1 case). Of these 84 cases, 48 were identified as not having fracture/dislocation and 36 cases were identified with fracture/dislocation for surgical interventions. Good functional outcomes from graft repair of graft length < 6 cm (70%) and neurolysis (85%) in low-intensity peroneal nerve injuries associated with sports were obtained. Recovery from graft repair of graft length between 6 and 12 cm (43%) was good and measured between Grades 3 and 4. However, recovery from graft repair of graft length between 13 and 24 cm was obtained in only 25% of patients.

The reproducibility of day-to-day testing of isokinetic concentric and eccentric muscular actions among adolescent basketball players aged 14 to 16 years and relationships of mean within-subject variation in two isokinetic testing sessions with chronological age, biological maturation (estimated age at peak height velocity), training experience, body size, lower-body morphology, and initial strength performance were evaluated. Material and Methods. The sample included 27 basketball players who completed replicate test sessions of 5 repetitions of reciprocal concentric and eccentric knee extensions and flexions at 60º s–1. A randomly selected subsample of 8 players completed a third testing session to confirm reliability estimates. Results. Coefficients of variation (CV) between sessions 1 and 2 ranged from 8.1% to 17.4%, and intraclass coefficients (ICCs) ranged from 0.72 to 0.89. For sessions 1 and 3, CVs ranged from 3.9% to 6.0%, and ICCs ranged from 0.95 to 0.99. The initial level of strength of eccentric knee flexion (r=–0.43) and eccentric knee extension (r=–0.42) were correlated (P<0.05) with eccentric knee extension within-variation between two sessions. Training experience (r=–0.37, P<0.05) and initial values of concentric knee flexion (r=–0.62, P<0.01) were correlated with concentric knee flexion within-subject differences. Within-subject variation of eccentric knee extension was correlated (P<0.05) with chronologic age (r=0.41), estimated age at peak height velocity (r=–0.38), body size (r=0.41 to 0.47), and leg volume (r=0.39). Conclusions. Familiarization sessions may improve the reliability of concentric and eccentric knee isokinetic strength testing at 60º s–1 in adolescent basketball players. Age, maturity status, and training experience of young athletes should be considered when testing knee isokinetic strength at 60º s–1.","https://www.mdpi.com/1648-9144/47/8/446/pdf",""

These efforts have culminated in some commercial and noncommercial software packages such as JSLAB and ISLAB2000. Even though JSLAB has undergone several improvements since 1986, the underlying core of the software maintains the characteristics of the initial ILLI-SLAB code. A thorough review of JSLAB2004 revealed that it would be beneficial to redesign the software completely to take advantage of modern computer resources and finite element modeling techniques available today. For this reason, a new analysis tool was developed that significantly improves on the efficiency and capabilities of JSLAB2004. The improvements led to NYSLAB, a tool that (a) has no limitations on the number of jointed slabs and foundation layers analyzed, (b) more accurately models the contact between debonded slabs and between the bottom slab and the top foundation layer, (c) models the foundation layers beyond the edge of the slabs to predict more accurately the edge deflections and stresses, and (d) significantly improves the capabilities for modeling a nonlinear thermal profile on all slab layers to predict more accurately their curling response. A series of parametric studies was conducted to evaluate the performance of NYSLAB and highlight the new and improved capabilities.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/2227-12",""

Therefore, firms continuously try to improve their internal customer service operations to increase benefits for customer service agents and, by extension, their customers. The authors hypothesize that the way firms design (agent codesign and design acceleration) and implement (agent enablement) an internal customer service innovation has direct and joint effects on the magnitude of benefits of the innovation to customer service agents, termed internal innovation magnitude. The authors test the conceptual model using data on 38 internal customer service innovations at a Fortune 500 high-technology firm. The findings extend the internal marketing literature by demonstrating that service employees represent a critical source of user-generated feedback. The findings also contribute to marketing practice by suggesting that accelerating the design process not only saves costs but also increases benefits for the internal users of the innovation.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1094670511401007",""

Population inversion achieved for the second-positive-band laser transitions of molecular nitrogen enables stimulated emission of ultraviolet radiation at 337 nm.

This paper proposes a hierarchical Markov model to estimate the reliability of RAID systems. The method encompasses Markov models for evaluating the reliability of individual disks at the lower level and the redundant model for evaluating the reliability of entire RAID at the system level. Both hardware and media failures are considered, and the media failures can be potentially recovered via the disk self-restoration mechanism. The system mean-time-to-data-loss is also derived and results are compared to those estimated from system-based Markov models. The major contribution of this work is that the reliability for RAID systems is approached by combining the redundant modeling technique with the single disk-based Markov model, thus simplifying the computational efforts. The proposed method is applied on RAID-5 and RAID-6 systems to demonstrate the applicability and performance of the new model.","https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S0218539311004019",""

Method: Two samples of children with specific language impairment (SLI) and their age-matched peers (British Columbia sample, Results: Both studies indicated that, compared with age peers, the children with SLI were more likely to produce stories of uneven strength—either stories with poor content that were grammatically quite accurate or stories with elaborated content that were less grammatical. Conclusions: These findings suggest that school-age children with SLI may struggle with the cumulative load of creating a story that is both elaborate and grammatical. They also show that the absence of errors is not necessarily a sign of strength. Finally, they underscore the value of comparing individual differences in multiple linguistic domains, including the elaboration of content, grammatical accuracy, and syntactic complexity.","http://pubs.asha.org/doi/pdf/10.1044/1092-4388%282011/10-0247%29",""

In addition, perceptions of parental indulgence were examined in terms of their association with adolescent eating behaviours and health. The results revealed a paradox related to indulgent parenting, with both positive and negative outcomes for adolescents. Structural equation analyses showed that parental indulgence was not only related to lower stress and higher life satisfaction, but also to unhealthy eating behaviours. Path analysis indicated that both positive and negative eating outcomes for adolescents were related to parental indulgence. This research has many implications for both parent and adolescent health education, focusing on parenting styles, stress and healthy lifestyles.

Materials and Methods:: For this study, the reports of 156,342 cervical cytology were available of which 12,226 (7.8%) were from teenagers. A total of 192 teenagers with high grade intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) cervical cytology were identified. The ages ranged from 13 to 19 years with a mean of 17.7 years and a median of 18 years. Among them, 31.3% were pregnant, 12.0% were postpartum, and 13.5% were on oral contraceptive. Ninety-eight had prior cervical cytology. Results:: The teenagers had statistically significant higher detection rates of overall abnormal cervical cytology (23.6% vs. 6.6%, P = 0), with 15.4% vs. 3.2% ( Conclusion:: We conclude that cytology screening of high risk teenagers is effective in detecting CIN 2/3 lesions.

Therefore, the organization or clustering of WSNs needs to be survivable to the changing situations. On the other hand, energy efficiency in WSNs remains the main concern to achieve a longer network lifetime. In this work, we associate survivability and energy efficiency with the clustering of WSNs and show that such a proactive scheme can actually increase the lifetime. We present an easy-to-implement method named DED (distributed, energy-efficient, and dual-homed clustering) which provides robustness for WSNs without relying on the redundancy of dedicated sensors, that is, without depending on node density. DED uses the information already gathered during the clustering process to determine backup routes from sources to observers, thus incurring low message overhead. It does not make any assumptions about network dimension, node capacity, or location awareness and terminates in a constant number of iterations. The correctness of the algorithm is proved analytically. Simulation results comparing with contemporary approaches demonstrate that our approach is effective both in providing survivability and in prolonging the network lifetime.","http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/ijdsn/2011/257156.pdf",""

The specific aim of this study was to create a decision aid to help make individualized estimates of the potential survival benefit of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for patients with resected gallbladder cancer. Methods: Patients with resected gallbladder cancer were selected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) –Medicare database who were diagnosed between 1995 and 2005. Covariates included age, race, sex, stage, and receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Propensity score weighting was used to balance covariates between treated and untreated groups. Several types of multivariate survival regression models were constructed and compared, including Cox proportional hazards, Weibull, exponential, log-logistic, and lognormal models. Model performance was compared using the Akaike information criterion. The primary end point was overall survival with or without adjuvant chemotherapy or CRT. Results: A total of 1,137 patients met the inclusion criteria for the study. The lognormal survival model showed the best performance. A Web browser–based nomogram was built from this model to make individualized estimates of survival. The model predicts that certain subsets of patients with at least T2 or N1 disease will gain a survival benefit from adjuvant CRT, and the magnitude of benefit for an individual patient can vary. Conclusion: A nomogram built from a parametric survival model from the SEER-Medicare database can be used as a decision aid to predict which gallbladder patients may benefit from adjuvant CRT.","https://ascopubs.org/doi/pdfdirect/10.1200/JCO.2010.33.8020",""

This raises a question about the larger West Antarctic ice shelves. Do these shelves, with their much greater glacial discharge, have a history of collapse? Here we describe features from the seafloor in Pine Island Bay, West Antarctica, which we interpret as having been formed during a massive ice shelf break-up and associated grounding line retreat. This evidence exists in the form of seafloor landforms that we argue were produced daily as a consequence of tidally influenced motion of mega-icebergs maintained upright in an iceberg armada produced from the disintegrating ice shelf and retreating grounding line.

Whereas this conclusion is based on the assumption that work in teams consists exclusively of tasks that are shared, typical teamwork also includes tasks that are individualized. Results of a laboratory study of 206 participants performing a mix of individualized and shared tasks in four‐person teams indicate that heterogeneous combinations of individualism and collectivism are associated with higher levels of team member performance, measured as quantity of output, when loose structural interdependence enables individual differences in individualism–collectivism to exert meaningful effects. These results support the modified conclusion that a combination of individualism and collectivism is associated with higher levels of member performance in teams under typical work conditions; that is, conditions in which the tasks of individual members are both individualized and shared.

However, the combined action of diverse organisms and their different metabolites on plant health has yet to be fully appreciated. Here, the multifactorial nature of these interactions, at the organismal and molecular level, leading to the biological control of plant diseases is reviewed. To do so, we describe in detail the ecological significance of three different classes of secondary metabolites and discuss how they might contribute to biological control. Specifically, the roles of auxin, acetoin, and phenazines are considered, because they represent very different but important types of secondary metabolites. We also describe how studies of the global regulation of bacterial secondary metabolism have led to the discovery of new genes and phenotypes related to plant health promotion. In conclusion, we describe three avenues for future research that will help to integrate these complex and diverse observations into a more coherent synthesis of bacterially mediated biocontrol of plant diseases.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/AEM.01867-10",""

The complex interplay among forest cells and agents calls for formal treatment of the fire spread and fire suppression models to verify the correctness of DEVS-FIRE. This paper gives formal design specifications of fire spread and suppression agent models used in DEVS-FIRE and applies DEVS-FIRE to both artificially generated and real topography, fuels and weather data for a study area located in the US state of Texas. The paper also develops a new method, called pre_Schedule, for scheduling ignition events of forest cells more efficiently than the original onTime_Schedule event scheduling method used in DEVS-FIRE. Simulation results show the performance improvement of the new method, and demonstrate the utility of DEVS-FIRE as a viable discrete event model for wildfire simulations.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0037549711414592",""

All CRICs between October 1, 1995 and June 20, 2010 were reviewed. Patients were contacted by phone, visited at their last known address, or queried in the Center for Disease Control's National Death Index. DECAN were those CRICs decannulated without revision. TRACH were those revised to a tracheostomy at any point. Ninety-five CRIC patients were identified. In 94 per cent of survivors of initial admission, a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 15 was noted at disposition. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation before or during CRIC performance was strongly associated with all-cause death during index admission, and increasing head Abbreviated Injury Score was associated with lower odds of a neurologically intact survival. Of survivors, 82 per cent of DECAN and 57 per cent of TRACH patients were followed-up with at medians of 48 (interquartile range 19-57) and 53 (20-119) months, respectively. DECAN occurred at a median of 4 days (2-7) whereas TRACH revision occurred at a median of 2 days (1-7). Endoscopy was performed on 36 per cent of DECAN patients and 22 per cent of TRACH patients. Two DECAN patients with acute subglottic edema/stenosis decannulated successfully on days 9 and 15 postinjury and had no problems at 54 and 91 months postinjury. At follow-up, no patient in either group had suffered a clinically evident airway complication. The need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation before or during CRIC portends poorly for neurologically intact survival. Simple decannulation is appropriate for CRIC patients when their need for airway protection has resolved.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/000313481107701248",""

TriMV has since been found in wheat samples isolated all across the Great Plains. Even though it can infect singularly, TriMV is mostly found with Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) as a co-infection. The potential for TriMV to cause economic loss is significant, but very little is known about the virus. The objective of this study was to survey the TriMV population for genetic variation by nucleotide sequencing of isolates across a geographical region. A secondary objective was to characterize the WSMV isolates that are being co-transmitted with TriMV. Fourteen different TriMV isolations were taken from locations in Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas, and the coat protein cDNA was sequenced. Thirteen nucleotide differences were found in the TriMV isolates, of which three induce amino acid changes. WSMV isolates had 65 nucleotide changes when compared to WSMV Sydney81. Our results indicate the TriMV virus population has minimal amounts of sequence variation and no singular WSMV genotype is specifically associated with TriMV co-infection. Based on the isolates analyzed, it appears that the field population of TriMV is very homogeneous.","https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/pdf/10.1094/PDIS-04-11-0281",""

Multiple pairs of inversion-derived attributes can be used in a crossplot domain. We performed a sensitivity analysis to determine an optimal crossplot, and the validity of the separation is tested with a comprehensive petroelastic reservoir model. We simulated a poorly consolidated shaly sandstone reservoir based on a prograding near-shore depositional environment. A model of effective porosity is first simulated by Gaussian geostatistics. Well-known theoretical and experimental petrophysical correlations were then efficiently combined to consistently simulate reservoir properties. Next, the reservoir model was subjected to numerical simulation of multiphase fluid flow to predict the spatial distributions of fluid saturation and pressure. A geologically consistent rock physics model was then used to simulate the inverted seismic attributes. Finally, we conducted a sensitivity analysis of seismic attributes and their crossplots as a tool to discriminate the effect of pressure and saturation. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that crossplotting of acoustic impedance versus shear impedance should be the most stable way to separate saturation and pressure changes compared to other crossplots (e.g., velocity ratio versus acoustic impedance). We also demonstrated that the saturation and pressure patterns were detected in most of the time-lapse scenarios; however, the saturation pattern is more likely detectable because the percentage in pressure change is often lower than that of the saturation change. Imperfections in saturation and pressure patterns exist in various forms, and they can be explained by the interaction of saturation and pressure, the diffusive nature of pressure, and rapid change in pressure due to production operations.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/geo2010-0275.1",""

The combined data set allows for the direct measurement with high precision of the energy separation between the E1/2 and E3/2 components of the ground state and the energy separation between the parity stacks in the E3/2 component of the ground state. The experimentally observed frequencies in both isotopologues are fit to an effective rotational Hamiltonian accounting for rotational and spin-rotational effects arising in a near-prolate asymmetric top molecule with dynamic Jahn-Teller distortion. Isotopic dependencies for the molecular parameters have been successfully implemented to aid the analysis of these very complex spectra. The analysis of the first and second order contributions to the effective values of molecular parameters has been extended to elucidate the physical significance of resulting molecular parameters. Comparisons of measured parameters, e.g., spin-orbit coupling, rotational and spin-rotation constants, are made among the 5 methoxy isotopologues for which data is now available.

The need for such autonomic system and application management is becoming critical as computing infrastructures become increasingly heterogeneous, integrating different classes of resources from high-end HPC systems to commodity clusters and clouds. For example, the framework presented in this paper can be used to provision the appropriate mix of resources based on application requirements and constraints. The framework also monitors the system/application state and adapts the application and/or resources to respond to changing requirements or environment. To demonstrate the operation of the framework and to evaluate its ability, we employ a workflow used to characterize an oil reservoir executing on a hybrid infrastructure composed of TeraGrid nodes and Amazon EC2 instances of various types. Specifically, we show how different applications objectives such as acceleration, conservation and resilience can be effectively achieved while satisfying deadline and budget constraints, using an appropriate mix of dynamically provisioned resources.

Data were collected off the west coast of the United States. Detailed comparisons and analysis of the derived co-located bottom loss data were made. The metric used for comparison was the difference of the estimated MGS curves at specific co-located sites. The set of MGS curves used as the metric for comparison between the two methods ranges from MGS-1, corresponding to a low-loss bottom, to MGS-9, corresponding to a high-loss bottom, in one tenth increments, i.e., MGS-1.1, MGS-1.2, to MGS-8.9, MGS-9.0.

Namely, accurate determination of the conceptual metaphors held by participants based on the investigation of linguistic metaphors has been identified as a methodological issue because of the subjectivity involved in the interpretation; that is, because they are necessarily situated in specific social and cultural milieus, meanings of particular metaphors are not universally constructed nor understood. In light of these critiques, this article provides examples of two different triangulation methods that can be employed to supplement the trustworthiness of the findings when metaphor analysis methodologies are used.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/160940691101000204",""

Although most studies have defined periprocedural myocardial infarction (pMI) as an elevation in CK-MB >3× upper limit of normal (ULN), use of different CK-MB assays and variation in site-specific definitions of the ULN may limit the value of such relative thresholds. Methods and Results—: We used data from the multicenter Evaluation of Drug-Eluting Stents and Ischemic Events (EVENT) registry to examine the impact of variations in site-specific thresholds for CK-MB elevation on the incidence of pMI as well as the relationship between absolute peak levels of CK-MB after PCI and 1-year mortality. The study cohort consisted of 6347 patients who underwent nonemergent PCI and had normal CK-MB at baseline. Across the 59 study centers, the ULN for CK-MB ranged from 2.6 to 10.4 ng/mL (median, 5.0 ng/mL), and there was an inverse relationship between the site-specific ULN and the incidence of pMI (defined as CK-MB elevation >3× ULN). Although any postprocedure elevation of CK-MB was associated with an adverse prognosis, in categorical analyses, only CK-MB ≥50 ng/mL was independently associated with increased 1-year mortality (hazard ratio, 4.71; 95% confidence interval, 2.42 to 9.13; Conclusions—: Among unselected patients undergoing PCI, there is a graded relationship between CK-MB elevation after PCI and 1-year mortality that is particularly strong for large CK-MB elevations (>30 to 50 ng/mL). Future studies that include pMI as a clinical end point should consider using a core laboratory to assess CK-MB (to ensure consistency) and raising the threshold for defining pMI above current levels (to enhance clinical relevance).","https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCINTERVENTIONS.111.962233",""

The middle fossa approach provides the patient with an opportunity for tumor removal with hearing preservation. OBJECTIVE:: To determine the rate of hearing preservation and facial nerve outcomes after removal of a vestibular schwannoma with the use of the middle fossa approach. METHODS:: A retrospective case review at a tertiary, academic medical center was performed identifying patients from 1998 through 2008 that underwent removal of a vestibular schwannoma by the middle fossa approach. Preoperative and postoperative audiograms were compared to determine hearing preservation rates. In addition, facial nerve outcomes at last follow-up were recorded. RESULTS:: Forty-six patients underwent a middle fossa craniotomy for the removal of a vestibular schwannoma. Of the 38 patients that had class A or class B hearing preoperatively, 24 (63.2%) retained class A or B hearing and 29 (76.3%) retained class A, B, or C hearing. When tumors were 10 mm or less in patients with class A or B preoperative hearing, 22 of 30 patients (73.3%) retained class A or B hearing. When the tumor size was greater than 10 mm in patients with class A or B preoperative hearing, 2 of 8 patients (25%) retained class A or B hearing. At most recent follow-up, 76.1% of patients had House-Brackmann grade I facial function, 13.0% had House-Brackmann grade II facial function, and 10.9% had House-Brackmann grade III facial function. CONCLUSION:: Hearing preservation rates are excellent using the middle fossa approach, especially for smaller tumors. No patient experienced long-term facial nerve function worse than House-Brackmann grade III.","http://academic.oup.com/neurosurgery/article-pdf/70/2/334/32585071/neurosurgery-70-2-334.pdf",""

The temperature dependence of the band edge is studied using absorption spectroscopy and found to be described by electron-phonon interactions. The temperature dependence of the PL emission intensities and lifetimes are described by a model incorporating the effects of thermal activation and hopping, both of which compete with the radiative process. These factors are smaller than the observed Stokes shift between absorption and emission, and attributed to intra-well electron transfer that varies according to 2D and 3D character. High excitation intensity reveals two PL bands in the sample with intermediate 2D/3D well morphology.

We investigated whether Klotho levels and signaling modulate inflammation in diabetic kidneys. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Renal Klotho expression was determined by quantitative real-time PCR and immunoblot analysis. Primary mouse tubular epithelial cells were treated with methylglyoxalated albumin, and Klotho expression and inflammatory cytokines were measured. Nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation was assessed by treating human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 and HK-2 cells with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in the presence or absence of Klotho, followed by immunoblot analysis to evaluate inhibitor of κB (IκB)α degradation, IκB kinase (IKK) and p38 activation, RelA nuclear translocation, and phosphorylation. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed to analyze the effects of Klotho signaling on interleukin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 promoter recruitment of RelA and RelA serine (Ser)536. RESULTS: Renal Klotho mRNA and protein were significantly decreased in db/db mice, and a similar decline was observed in the primary cultures of mouse tubule epithelial cells treated with methylglyoxal-modified albumin. The exogenous addition of soluble Klotho or overexpression of membranous Klotho in tissue culture suppressed NF-κB activation and subsequent production of inflammatory cytokines in response to TNF-α stimulation. Klotho specifically inhibited RelA Ser536 phosphorylation as well as promoter DNA binding of this phosphorylated form of RelA without affecting IKK-mediated IκBα degradation, total RelA nuclear translocation, and total RelA DNA binding. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that Klotho serves as an anti-inflammatory modulator, negatively regulating the production of NF-κB–linked inflammatory proteins via a mechanism that involves phosphorylation of Ser536 in the transactivation domain of RelA.","https://journals.org/diabetes/diabetes/article-pdf/60/7/1907/402312/1907.pdf",""

In experimental models of RSV LRTI, the actions of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcription factor mediate inflammation and pathology. We have shown that RSV replication induces a mitogen-and-stress-related kinase 1 (MSK-1) pathway that activates NF-κB RelA transcriptional activity by a process involving serine phosphorylation at serine (Ser) residue 276. In this study, we examined the mechanism by which phospho-Ser276 RelA mediates expression of the NF-κB-dependent gene network. RelA-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) complemented with the RelA Ser276Ala mutant are deficient in CXCL2/Groβ, KC, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression, but NFKBIA/IκBα is preserved. We show that RSV-induced RelA Ser276 phosphorylation is required for acetylation at Lys310, an event required for transcriptional activity and stable association of RelA with the activated positive transcriptional elongation factor (PTEF-b) complex proteins, bromodomain 4 (Brd4), and cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9). In contrast to gene loading pattern of PTEF-b proteins produced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) stimulation, RSV induces their initial clearance followed by partial reaccumulation coincident with RelA recruitment. The RSV-induced binding patterns of the CDK9 substrate, phospho-Ser2 RNA polymerase (Pol) II, follows a similar pattern of clearance and downstream gene reaccumulation. The functional role of CDK9 was examined using CDK9 small interfering RNA (siRNA) and CDK inhibitors, where RSV-induced NF-κB-dependent gene expression was significantly inhibited. Finally, although RSV induces a transition from short transcripts to fully spliced mRNA in wild-type RelA (RelA WT)-expressing cells, this transition is not seen in cells expressing RelA Ser276Ala. We conclude that RelA Ser276 phosphorylation mediates RelA acetylation, Brd4/CDK9 association, and activation of downstream inflammatory genes by transcriptional elongation in RSV infection.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.05360-11",""

PCI-32765 is an orally-administered irreversible inhibitor of Btk which induces apoptosis and inhibits cellular migration and adhesion in malignant B-cells. An early analysis of the phase Ib/II study PCYC-1102 showed PCI-32765 to be highly active and tolerable in patients with CLL (Byrd, ASCO 2011). Here we report longer-term follow-up of this multicenter phase Ib/II trial. Methods and Patients:: Two cohorts of CLL patients (previously untreated ≥65 years old and relapsed/refractory [R/R] disease following at least 2 prior therapies, including fludarabine) were treated with oral PCI-32765 administered daily for 28-day cycles until progression of disease. Doses of 420mg (previously untreated and R/R) and 840mg daily (R/R) were examined. The patients with R/R disease are the subject of this report. Results:: Sixty-one R/R CLL/SLL patients were enrolled (420mg cohort n=27, 840mg cohort n=34). The median follow-up time for the 420mg cohort is 10.2 months and for the 840mg cohort is 6.5 months. The median number of prior treatment regimens for the 420mg cohort was 3 (2–10) and for the 840mg cohort was 5 (1–12). Seventy-two percent of patients had at least one poor-risk molecular feature: del(17p) 31%, del(11q) 33%, IgVH un-mutated 57%. Treatment has been well tolerated. Two patients have discontinued for adverse events (AE); 6 patients have required reduction of PCI-32765 dose (420mg cohort 2/27, 840mg cohort 4/34). Grade 1 or 2 diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, and ecchymosis have been the most frequently reported AEs. Serious AEs (SAEs) have occurred in 38% of patients; SAEs considered potentially related to PCI-32765 have occurred in 10% of patients. Grade ≥3 AEs considered potentially related to PCI-32765 occurred in 21% of patients. A characteristic pattern of response, with a transient phase of lymphocytosis typically peaking within the first 2 months of Rx, followed by resolution over time, has been observed in the majority of patients. Objective response (ORR; PR + CR) by IWCLL criteria in the 420mg cohort cohort, previously reported as 48% with 6.2 months median follow-up (Byrd, et al ASCO 2011), is now 70% with 10.2 months median follow-up. ORR in the 840mg cohort is 44% at 6.5 months median follow-up. An additional 19%, and 35% of patients in these cohorts, respectively, have a nodal PR (>50% reduction in aggregate lymph node size) with residual lymphocytosis. ORR appears to be independent of molecular risk features. Eighty-two percent of patients (50/61; 420mg cohort 22/27, 840mg cohort 28/34) remain on PCI-32765. Only 8% (5/61) of patients have had progressive disease (PD); 6-month PFS is 92% in the 420mg cohort and 90% in the 840mg cohort. Treatment cessation not related to PD or AE includes: death (n=2) or investigator discretion (n=3). Conclusions:: The potent Btk inhibitor PCI-32765 is well tolerated and is associated with high rates of 6-month PFS in R/R CLL/SLL. Phase III trials of PCI-32765 in CLL/SLL are planned.

With the extensive connection between the cerebellum to brain-stem structures and cerebral cortex, it is possible that the cerebellum may facilitate the descending system to modulate spinal dorsal horn activity. This study provided the first evidence to support this hypothesis. Thirty-one wide-dynamic-range neurons from the left lumbar and 27 from the right lumbar spinal dorsal horn were recorded in response to graded mechanical stimulation (brush, pressure, and pinch) at the hind paws. Electrical stimulation of the cerebellar cortex of the left intermediate hemisphere significantly reduced spinal cord dorsal horn neuron-evoked responses bilaterally in response to peripheral high-intensity mechanical stimuli.

Methods: A retrospective review and software analysis was performed by three independent observers. Measurements of distance and angulation from the AEA to the NC, NB, and axilla of the middle turbinate were performed. A total of 138 unique computed tomography (CT) scans performed at a university tertiary care center were evaluated. Results: The average age of the patients whose scans were analyzed was 50.5 (range, 17–90 years) years of age. The gender distribution was 61 male and 89 female patients. After comparing the measurements to the three landmarks noted, it was determined that the NB had the most interpatient concordance and the least interobserver variability. The average distance between the NB and the AEA as it penetrates the lamina papyracea is 2.34 cm (variance, 0.07) at an angle of 45.21° from the Frankfurt horizontal line. Conclusion: The real advantage of this novel use of the NB as a landmark to identify the AEA is that it is easy to use, unobtrusive, and is not time-consuming. This relationship between the NB and the AEA is consistent across genders and ethnicities and is more valuable than others presented previously, which may be more variable.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2500/ajra.2011.25.3541",""

In most such decision experiments, participants receive feedback after every trial (full feedback), and a single base rate (usually 0.5) is used. Our experiment explored conditional feedback (feedback only after positive decisions) representing common selection and detection tasks (such as hiring), where the decision maker receives no feedback unless the decision is positive (e.g., hire the applicant). We used three base rates (0.2, 0.5, and 0.8). As expected, performance was best in full feedback, but after 300 learning trials, the difference was small. Conditional feedback generally resulted in fewer positive decisions than full feedback, but this difference was not found in the low (0.2) base rate condition. There were interactions between base rates and types of feedback. Results provide partial support for the constructivist encoding hypothesis of Elwin and colleagues. Simulation results suggest that our results may reflect overconfidence when feedback is not given. With respect to rate of learning, when the base rate was 0.2, conditional feedback participants reached approximately the same selection rate but did so more slowly than the full feedback participants. Partial feedback participants learned slower and appeared to be still learning after 500 trials. When the base rate was 0.5 or 0.8, partial feedback was nearly as good as full feedback, but conditional feedback resulted in a systematically lower rate of positive decisions.

Univariate and multivariable analyses of survey data were conducted. The four most believable sources of health information as indicated by survey respondents were health center medical staff, health educators, faculty or coursework, and parents. Health center medical staff, health educators, and faculty or coursework were underutilized in relation to their perceived believability, whereas parents were both used and believed at high frequencies. In general, older students, females, full time students, and Black and Hispanic students were more likely to use information from one of the four health sources. However, there was considerable subgroup variability, especially in the use of parents as a health information source. The authors conclude that information on use and believability of health information sources can help colleges to design more effective health information campaigns.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1524839910369995",""

Disaggregate models that can account for the myriad of factors that influence the school mode choice of children are needed to forecast the potential impacts of such programs and policies. This paper presents a model for school mode choice that can capture the unobserved spatial interaction effects that may influence household decision making in choosing a mode of transportation for children's trips to and from school. For example, households that are geographically close together in a neighborhood may interact or observe one another and be influenced by each other's actions. To overcome the computational intractability associated with estimating a discrete choice model with spatial interaction effects, the paper proposes a maximum approximated composite marginal likelihood approach for estimating model parameters. The model is applied to a sample of children in Southern California whose households responded to the 2009 National Household Travel Survey in the United States. Spatial correlation effects are statistically significant, and they arise from interactions among households that are geographically close to one another. The findings suggest that public policy programs aimed at enhancing the use of bicycle and walk modes may have a greater impact if directed toward the local neighborhood level as opposed to a more diffuse regional level.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/2213-11",""

Secondary questions included the comparative laboratory yields of body swabs versus other specimens, and the correlation between physical findings and laboratory results. PATIENTS AND METHODS:: Data from evidence-collection kits from children 13 years and younger were reviewed. Kits were screened for evidence using traditional methods, and DNA testing was performed for positive specimens. Laboratory data were compared with historical information. RESULTS:: There were 277 evidence-collection kits analyzed; 151 were collected from children younger than 10; 222 kits (80%) had 1 or more positive laboratory screening test, of which 56 (20%) tested positive by DNA. The time interval to collection was &lt;24 hours for 30 of the 56 positive kits (68% positives with a documented time interval), and 24 (43% of all positive kits) were positive only by nonbody specimens. The majority of children with DNA were aged 10 or older, but kits from 14 children younger than 10 also had a positive DNA result, of which 5 were positive by a body swab collected between 7 and 95 hours after assault. Although body swabs were important sources of evidence for older children, they were significantly less likely than nonbody specimens to yield DNA among children younger than 10 (P = .002). There was no correlation between physical findings and laboratory evidence. CONCLUSIONS:: Body samples should be considered for children beyond 24 hours after assault, although the yield is limited. Physical examination findings do not predict yield of forensic laboratory tests.","https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-pdf/128/2/233/844588/zpe00811000233.pdf",""

Patients and Methods.: Patients with relapsed/refractory AML and older patients for whom there was a concern over toxicity from additional anthracyclines received 5 days of clofarabine, 40 mg/m2 per day i.v. over 1 hour, followed 4 hours later by Ara-C, 1,000 mg/m2 per day i.v. over 2 hours. Results.: Thirty patients were enrolled. The median age was 67 years (range, 38–82 years) and 18 (60%) had received at least one prior therapy. Eleven (37%) patients had a history of cardiovascular disease and were considered to be at high risk for anthracycline toxicity. High-risk cytogenetic abnormalities were present in 14 (47%) patients. The overall response rate (complete remission [CR] plus partial remission) was 53%, including a CR in 14 patients (47%). Responses were observed in all cytogenetic risk groups and in patients who had received up to five prior therapies. The median disease-free survival interval was 9.5 months. The 30-day mortality rate was 20% (de novo AML, 8%; relapsed/refractory AML, 28%). Of the 14 patients achieving a CR, half were able to proceed to curative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Conclusions.: Clofarabine in combination with Ara-C is effective in both untreated and previously treated patients with AML. In addition, it represents a useful remission induction strategy to serve as a bridge to transplantation in older patients with AML.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1634/theoncologist.2010-0220",""

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were from 1,729 adults (≥60 years) with diabetes in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999–2008. Disability in activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), leisure and social activities (LSA), general physical activities (GPA), and lower-extremity mobility (LEM) was obtained from self-reports. Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) (mg/g) was categorized into normal (UACR &lt;30 mg/g), microalbuminuria (UACR 30–300 mg/g), and macroalbuminuria (UACR &gt;300 mg/g). C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were quantified by latex-enhanced nephelometry. RESULTS: In the full-adjusted model, microalbuminuria was associated with disability in ADL, LSA, and LEM with corresponding odds ratios (ORs) (95% CIs) of 1.51 (1.16–1.98), 1.62 (1.23–2.14), and 1.34 (1.03–1.74), respectively, compared with participants without albuminuria. Macroalbuminuria was associated with disability in ADL, IADL, and LEM with corresponding ORs (95% CIs) of 1.94 (1.24–3.03), 1.93 (1.23–3.02), and 2.20 (1.38–3.49), respectively, compared with participants without albuminuria. Elevated CRP (&gt;0.3 mg/dL) was associated with increased odds of disability in ADL and LEM, with corresponding ORs (95% CIs) of 1.28 (1.00–1.62) and 1.68 (1.34–2.11), respectively. Subjects with both albuminuria and elevated CRP had higher odds of disability than individuals with no albuminuria and normal CRP. CONCLUSIONS: Albuminuria and inflammation were independent correlates for disability among older adults with diabetes. There was an interaction of albuminuria and elevated CRP on disability, suggesting that the presence of subclinical inflammation may amplify the effect of albuminuria on disability in older adults living with diabetes.","https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/34/3/710/611276/710.pdf",""

The extreme diversity of mutations being detected presents significant challenges to subdivide causal from coincidental mutations to elucidate how disrupted regulatory networks drive cancer processes. Given that a common early perturbation in solid tumor initiation is bypass of matrix-dependent proliferation restraints, we sought to functionally interrogate colorectal cancer candidate genes (CAN-genes) to identify driver tumor suppressors. We have employed an isogenic human colonic epithelial cell (HCEC) model to identify suppressors of anchorage-independent growth by conducting a soft agar–based short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen within the cohort of CAN-genes. Remarkably, depletion of 65 of the 151 CAN-genes tested collaborated with ectopic expression of K-RASV12 and/or TP53 knockdown to promote anchorage-independent proliferation of HCECs. In contrast, only 5 of 362 random shRNAs (1.4%) enhanced soft agar growth. We have identified additional members of an extensive gene network specifying matrix-dependent proliferation, by constructing an interaction map of these confirmed progression suppressors with approximately 700 mutated genes that were excluded from CAN-genes, and experimentally verifying soft agar growth enhancement in response to depletion of a subset of these genes. Collectively, this study revealed a profound diversity of nodes within a fundamental tumor suppressor network that are susceptible to perturbation leading to enhanced cell-autonomous anchorage-independent proliferative fitness. Tumor suppressor network fragility as a paradigm within this and other regulatory systems perturbed in cancer could, in large part, account for the heterogeneity of somatic mutations detected in tumors.

In-depth interviews were conducted with 12 adolescent cancer survivors. Constant comparative analysis was used to identify core themes from the data. Findings revealed that adolescent survivors might experience an identity paradox when making the transition to “survivor,” which can contribute to their sense of isolation and risk of health-detracting behaviors.

The radius of investigation can also be useful in identifying new well locations and planning, designing and optimizing hydraulic fractures in unconventional reservoirs. It has additional implications in estimating reserves and understanding stimulated reservoir volumes. There are many definitions of radius of investigation in the literature and Kuchuk (2009) summarized them recently. Although these definitions vary in detail, they all relate to the propagation of a pressure disturbance or impose thresholds on detectable pressure or rate changes. In this article we will focus on the definition proposed by Lee (1982). Lee defines the radius of investigation as the propagation distance of the “peak” pressure disturbance for an impulse source or sink. For simplified flow geometries and homogeneous reservoir conditions, the radius of investigation can be calculated analytically. However, such analytic solutions are severely limited for heterogeneous and fractured reservoirs, particularly for unconventional reservoirs with multistage hydraulic fractures.","http://onepetro.org/JPT/article-pdf/63/07/52/2207055/spe-0711-0052-jpt.pdf",""

High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) has been identified as a potential premalignant lesion marking an increased risk of prostate cancer and substantial evidence suggests that men with HGPIN are in need of prostate cancer prevention. In vitro, in vivo, epidemiologic, and clinical trial evidence that selenium supplementation protects against prostate cancer motivated the study we report here: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of selenium 200 (μg/d) as selenomethionine in men with HGPIN. The primary endpoint was progression of HGPIN to prostate cancer over a 3-year period. This National Cancer Institute Intergroup trial was coordinated by the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG). Of 619 enrolled patients, 423 randomized men with HGPIN (212 selenium and 211 placebo) were eligible (by central pathology review) and included in the primary analysis. Three-year cancer rates were 36.6% (placebo) versus 35.6% (selenium; P = 0.73, adjusted). The majority of patients who developed cancer on trial (70.8%, selenium and 75.5%, placebo) had a Gleason score of 6 or less than 6; there were no differences in Gleason scores between the two arms. Subset analyses included the finding of a nonsignificantly reduced prostate cancer risk (relative risk = 0.82; 95% CI: 0.40–1.69) in selenium versus placebo patients in the lowest quartile of baseline plasma selenium level (&lt;106 ng/mL). Overall, and in all other subsets defined by baseline blood selenium levels, selenium supplementation had no effect on prostate cancer risk. The 36% prostate cancer rate in men with HGPIN indicates the association of this lesion with an elevated prostate cancer risk. Future study in this setting should focus on selenium-deficient populations and selenium pharmacogenetics.

However, pathways responsible for downregulation of therapeutic receptors, as well as subsequent aggressiveness, remain unknown. In this study, we discovered that lactoferrin (Lf) efficiently downregulates levels of ER-α, PR, and HER-2 in a proteasome-dependent manner in breast cancer cells, and it accounts for the loss of responsiveness to ER- or HER-2–targeted therapies. Furthermore, we found that lactoferrin increases migration and invasiveness of both non-TNBC and TNBC cell lines. We discovered that lactoferrin directly stimulates the transcription of endothelin-1 (ET-1), a secreted proinvasive polypeptide that acts through a specific receptor, ET(A)R, leading to secretion of the bioactive ET-1 peptide. Interestingly, a therapeutic ET-1 receptor-antagonist blocked lactoferrin-dependent motility and invasiveness of breast cancer cells. The physiologic significance of this newly discovered Lf–ET-1 axis in the manifestation of TNBC phenotypes is revealed by elevated plasma and tissue lactoferrin and ET-1 levels in patients with TNBC compared with those in ER+ cases. These findings describe the first physiologically relevant polypeptide as a functional determinant in downregulating all three therapeutic receptors in breast cancer, which uses another secreted ET-1 system to confer invasiveness. Results presented in this article provide proof-of-principle evidence in support of the therapeutic effectiveness of ET-1 receptor antagonist to completely block the lactoferrin-induced motility and invasiveness of the TNBC as well as non-TNBC cells, and thus, open a remarkable opportunity to treat TNBC by targeting the Lf–ET-1 axis using an approved developmental drug.

Water flows vertically in the unsaturated zone of the hillslope, but hydrological saturation periodically causes lateral flow along interfaces of permeability contrast between the A–B and B–C soil horizons. Changes in soil water Mg concentration respond to hydrological changes and are ultimately controlled by the kinetics of clay mineral dissolution, but are buffered by the soil exchange capacity. Clay dissolution predominantly occurs within the A and B horizons, and Mg released from these zones of “low‐flow” diffuses or flows into the “high‐flow” zones at horizon interfaces. The Mg concentrations are low in these high‐flow zones because fresher (younger) water flows in through macropores. The amplitude of seasonal variations in water isotopes (data from 2008–2010) decreases in the following order: precipitation (δD: 286‰) >> soil water (δD: 86‰) > shallow groundwater (δD: 26‰), indicating water becomes progressively older along the flowpath. Fractures and preferential high‐flow paths make the watershed hydrologically responsive: the average time water stays in the shallow subsurface is inferred to be <2 yr. The stream water chemistry is affected by inputs of old groundwater that is relatively high in Mg concentration but relatively limited in range in δD, as well as by inputs from young soil water that is relatively low in Mg concentration with a wide range in δD. The relative contributions of these two sources to the stream change seasonally.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.2136%2Fvzj2010.0133",""

Our experiments of C4F8 (and CHF3 not shown) plasmas show that the film growth is dominantly ion-enhanced. This leads naturally to a mask undercut that increases in time. A more neutral flux dominant deposition step would result in reduced mask undercut.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.3579542/14448855/161502_1_online.pdf",""

These methods such as gas recycling, hydraulic fracturing and solvent injection have shown to restore the production on a temporary basis only. Altering the wettability of reservoir rock using fluoro-chemical treatments has proved to be a viable and permanent solution to this problem. The selection of these treatments from a large pool of potentially effective chemicals requires extensive laboratory testing which requires time and money.","http://onepetro.org/SPEOCC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/141419-MS/1693190/spe-141419-ms.pdf",""

The total C accumulated in fertilized forests without weed control was 20% (slash pine) and 40% (loblolly pine) greater than in the control forests at the end of rotation. Weed control increased pine C pools at 18 years, but by the end of rotation, weed control effectively resulted in no gain in ecosystem C. When the two treatments were combined, weed control slightly subtracted from the net C benefit produced by fertilization. This result occurred because of decreased forest floor and soil C in the weed control plots. Fertilization significantly increased stem, foliage, forest floor, and soil N pools, and N retention was 63% and 103% of the applied N in the slash and loblolly pine forests, respectively.

We compared ES and USEF patients' clinical behavior, treatment, outcome, and molecular marker expression. Furthermore, preclinical ES study models were developed to enable comprehensive benchside investigations. Patients and Methods.: A database of ES and USEF patients (n = 116) treated since 1992 was created. A clinically annotated ES–USEF tissue microarray (TMA) was assayed for tumor-related markers. Newly established human and commercially available ES cell lines were characterized and tested in vivo. Results.: ES and USEF patients presenting with localized disease exhibited 22% and 25% local recurrence rates, 35% and 19% nodal metastasis rates, and 41% and 53% distant metastasis rates (median follow-up, 54 months and 39 months, respectively).

Conclusions.: Enhanced knowledge of ES and USEF clinical behavior, marker expression, and molecular determinants, extended via experimental models, will hopefully accelerate development of urgently needed effective targeted therapies for ES and USEF.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1634/theoncologist.2010-0174",""

In support of the mechanism, BAPTA, a fast calcium chelator, accelerates the sensitization, whereas the slow chelator EGTA is ineffectual. Here, we show that the sensitization of TRPV3 also occurred independently of Ca2+. It was observed in both inside-out and outside-out membrane patches. BAPTA, but not EGTA, has a direct potentiation effect on channel activation. Analogues of BAPTA lacking Ca2+-buffering capability were similarly effective. The stimulation-induced sensitization and the potentiation by BAPTA are distinguishable in reversibility. We conclude that the sensitization of TRPV3 is intrinsic to the channel itself and occurs as a result of hysteresis of channel gating. BAPTA accelerates the sensitization process by potentiating the gating of the channel.","https://rupress.org/jgp/article-pdf/138/5/509/1735648/jgp_201110689.pdf",""

Large area hBN epitaxial layers (up to 2 in. in diameter) were synthesized by metal organic chemical vapor deposition. P-type conductivity control was attained by in situ Mg doping. Compared to Mg-doped wurtzite AlN, which possesses a comparable energy band gap (∼6 eV), dramatic reductions in Mg acceptor energy level and P-type resistivity (by about six to seven orders of magnitude) have been realized in hBN epilayers.

Most chemokines reversibly exist as monomers and dimers, but very little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms by which the monomer-dimer equilibrium modulates in vivo function. For the chemokine CXCL8, we recently showed in a mouse lung model that monomers and dimers are active and that the monomer-dimer equilibrium of the WT plays a crucial role in regulating neutrophil recruitment. In this study, we show that monomers and dimers are also active in the mouse peritoneum but that the role of monomer-dimer equilibrium is distinctly different between these tissues and that mutations in GAG-binding residues render CXCL8 less active in the peritoneum but more active in the lung. We propose that tissue-specific differences in chemokine gradient formation, resulting from tissue-specific differences in GAG interactions, are responsible for the observed differences in neutrophil recruitment. Our observation of differential roles played by the CXCL8 monomer-dimer equilibrium and GAG interactions in different tissues is novel and reveals an additional level of complexity of how chemokine dimerization regulates in vivo recruitment.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1189%2Fjlb.0511239",""

Fifty healthy individuals underwent right heart catheterization to measure pulmonary capillary wedge (PCWP) and right atrial pressure (RAP).

Beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) waveforms were recorded, and stroke volume (SV) was derived from the Modelflow method. After measurements at −30 mmHg lower body negative pressure (LBNP), which approximates the upright position, LBNP was released, and beat-to-beat measurements were performed for 15 heartbeats.

RAP increased faster than PCWP resulting in an acute decrease in LVTMP from the fourth beat. A corresponding drop in SV by 3% was observed with no change in pulse pressure. From the 7th to 15th beats, LVTMP and SV increased steadily, followed by a decreased HR due to the baroreflex. A decreased TMP, but not PCWP, caused a transient drop in SV with no changes in HR or pulse pressure during LBNP release. These results suggest that the pericardium constrains LV filling during LBNP release, enough to cause a small but significant drop of SV, even at low cardiac filling pressure in healthy humans.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpheart.01198.2010",""

The mobility increases with increasing channel length eventually saturating at a constant value for channel lengths of several micrometers. The length dependence is consistent with the transition from a ballistic to diffusive transport regime. The mobility as a function of channel width first increases and then decreases. The increase in mobility for very small channel widths is consistent with a reduction in edge scattering. The decrease in mobility for larger channel widths is observed to be strongly dependent on the oxide thickness suggesting that electrostatics associated with fringing fields is an important effect. This effect is further confirmed by a comparative analysis of the measured mobility of graphene devices with similar channel dimensions on oxides of different thicknesses. The observed electrical measurements are in excellent agreement with theoretical studies predicting the width dependence of conductivity and mobility. The mobility of CVD grown graphene is slightly lower than that of exfoliated graphene but shows similar trends with length and width. The mobility values reported in the literature are in agreement with the trend reported here.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.3592338/15082620/104511_1_online.pdf",""

Calorie restriction (CR) prevents obesity, suppresses carcinogenesis in many models, and reduces serum levels of IGF-1. In the present study, we examined the impact of CR on a model of inflammation-associated pancreatitis and pancreatic dysplasia, with a focus on the mechanistic contribution of systemic IGF-1. Administration of a 30% CR diet for 14 weeks decreased serum IGF-1 levels and hindered pancreatic ductal lesion formation and dysplastic severity, relative to a higher calorie control diet, in transgenic mice overexpressing COX-2 [bovine keratin-5 promoter (BK5.COX-2)]. These findings in CR mice correlated with reductions in Ki-67–positive cells, vascular luminal size, VEGF expression, and phosphorylation and total expression of downstream mediators of the IGF-1 pathway. Cell lines derived from BK5.COX-2 ductal lesions (JC101 cells) formed pancreatic tumors in wild-type FVB mice that were significantly reduced in size by a 14-week CR regimen, relative to the control diet. To further understand the impact of circulating levels of IGF-1 on tumor growth in this model, we orthotopically injected JC101 cells into liver-specific IGF-1–deficient (LID) mice. The approximate 65% reduction of serum IGF-1 levels in LID mice resulted in significantly decreased burden of JC101 tumors, despite modestly elevated levels of circulating insulin and leptin. These data show that CR prevents development of dysplasia and growth of pancreatic cancer through alterations in IGF-1, suggesting that modulation of this pathway with dietary and/or pharmacologic interventions is a promising pancreatic cancer prevention strategy.

Clinical trials of adjuvant systemic therapy for such patients have been limited. Patients and Methods: The SWOG (Southwest Oncology Group) S9921 study randomly assigned 983 men with high-risk features at prostatectomy to receive adjuvant therapy with androgen deprivation (ADT) alone or in combination with mitoxantrone chemotherapy. ADT consisted of goserelin and bicalutamide for 2 years. Results: Although the final primary treatment comparison results are not ready for publication, this article reports results in the ADT-alone control arm with a median follow-up of 4.4 years. For these 481 men, the estimated 5-year biochemical failure-free survival is 92.5% (95% CI, 90 to 95), and 5-year overall survival is 95.9% (95% CI, 93.9 to 97.9). Conclusion: The results of this trial, taken in context, make a compelling argument for counseling all high-risk patients with prostate cancer about adjuvant ADT. This article discusses the challenges in the design and implementation of clinical trials to take the next step forward in adjuvant therapy for prostate cancer because of the excellent survival achieved with currently available therapies and highlights the need for better molecular markers to personalize care.","https://ascopubs.org/doi/pdfdirect/10.1200/JCO.2010.32.2776",""

While skin surface cooling improves orthostatic tolerance, it remains unknown whether this could be an effective countermeasure to preserve orthostatic tolerance following HDBR. We therefore tested the hypothesis that skin surface cooling improves orthostatic tolerance after prolonged HDBR. Eight subjects (six men and two women) participated in the investigation. Orthostatic tolerance was determined using a progressive lower-body negative pressure (LBNP) tolerance test before HDBR during normothermic conditions and on day 16 or day 18 of 6° HDBR during normothermic and skin surface cooling conditions (randomized order post-HDBR). The thermal conditions were achieved by perfusing water (normothermia ∼34°C and skin surface cooling ∼12–15°C) through a tube-lined suit worn by each subject. Tolerance tests were performed after ∼30 min of the respective thermal stimulus. A cumulative stress index (CSI; mmHg LBNP·min) was determined for each LBNP protocol by summing the product of the applied negative pressure and the duration of LBNP at each stage. HDBR reduced normothermic orthostatic tolerance as indexed by a reduction in the CSI from 1,037 ± 96 mmHg·min to 574 ± 63 mmHg·min ( P < 0.05). After HDBR, skin surface cooling increased orthostatic tolerance (797 ± 77 mmHg·min) compared with normothermia ( P < 0.05). While the reduction in orthostatic tolerance following prolonged HDBR was not completely reversed by acute skin surface cooling, the identified improvements may serve as an important and effective countermeasure for individuals exposed to microgravity, as well as immobilized and bed-stricken individuals.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/japplphysiol.00233.2010",""

To probe the molecular mechanisms underlying hypoxia responses and tolerance, we performed a genome-wide screen to identify mutants with enhanced hypoxia tolerance in the model eukaryote, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Yeast provides an excellent model for genomic and proteomic studies of hypoxia. We identified five genes whose deletion significantly enhanced hypoxia tolerance. They are RAI1, NSR1, BUD21, RPL20A, and RSM22, all of which encode functions involved in ribosome biogenesis. Further analysis of the deletion mutants showed that they minimized hypoxia-induced changes in polyribosome profiles and protein synthesis. Strikingly, proteomic analysis by using the iTRAQ profiling technology showed that a substantially fewer number of proteins were changed in response to hypoxia in the deletion mutants, compared with the parent strain. Computational analysis of the iTRAQ data indicated that the activities of a group of regulators were regulated by hypoxia in the wild-type parent cells, but such regulation appeared to be diminished in the deletion strains. These results show that the deletion of one of the genes involved in ribosome biogenesis leads to the reversal of hypoxia-induced changes in gene expression and related regulators. They suggest that modifying ribosomal function is an effective mechanism to minimize hypoxia-induced specific protein changes and to confer hypoxia tolerance. These results may have broad implications in understanding hypoxia responses and tolerance in diverse eukaryotes ranging from yeast to humans.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/physiolgenomics.00232.2010",""

However, both warning systems postdate measures of the earliest indicator of impending heart failure: left ventricular (LV) volume. There are currently no proposed implanted technologies that can perform LV blood volume measurements in humans. We propose to solve this problem by incorporating an admittance measurement system onto currently deployed biventricular and automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator leads. This study will demonstrate that an admittance measurement system can detect LV blood conductance from the epicardial position, despite the current generating and sensing electrodes being in constant motion with the heart, and with dynamic removal of the myocardial component of the returning voltage signal. Specifically, in 11 pigs, it will be demonstrated that 1) a physiological LV blood conductance signal can be derived; 2) LV dilation in response to dose-response intravenous neosynephrine can be detected by blood conductance in a similar fashion to the standard of endocardial crystals when admittance is used, but not when only traditional conductance is used; 3) the physiological impact of acute left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion and resultant LV dilation can be detected by blood conductance, before the anticipated secondary rise in right ventricular systolic pressure; and 4) a pleural effusion simulated by placing saline outside the pericardium does not serve as a source of artifact for blood conductance measurements.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/japplphysiol.01047.2010",""

Among M2 monocyte subpopulations, M2b monocytes (IL-17–CCL1+CXCL13–) are predominantly present in the peripheral blood of severely burned patients. In the present study, the rise and fall of M2b monocytes were examined in severely burned patients treated with propranolol. Catecholamine is known as an inducer of M2 monocytes, and propranolol is a competitive blocker of catecholamine binding to β-adrenergic receptors. Twenty-two children with 30% or more TBSA burn were enrolled in the study. Propranolol at a dose of 4 mg/kg/day was administered to these patients by feeding-tube or mouth. Burn patient monocytes exhibited weak bactericidal activity. IL-12 was produced by propranolol-treated patient monocytes after stimulation with Staphylococcus aureus antigen, and the production of IL-10, CCL1, CCL17, or CXCL13 by these monocytes was not demonstrated. These results indicate that a predominance of M2b monocytes in severely burned patients is intervened by the propranolol treatment. The increased susceptibility, to be associated with the appearance of M2b monocytes, of severely burned patients to opportunistic pathogens might be controlled by propranolol.","https://academic.oup.com/jleukbio/article-pdf/89/5/797/49616012/jlb0797.pdf",""

METHODS:: All parents of 3- to 5-year-old children in full-time child care at 9 central Texas centers were invited to participate in the study. Foods packed by the parents for lunch were individually removed from the sack and immediately measured with noncontact temperature guns 1.5 hours before food was served to the children. Type of food and number of ice packs in the lunch sack were also recorded. Descriptive analyses were conducted by using SPSS 13.0 for Windows. RESULTS:: Lunches, with at least 1 perishable item in each, were assessed from 235 parent-child dyads. Approximately 39% (n = 276) of the 705 lunches analyzed had no ice packs, 45.1% (n = 318) had 1 ice pack, and 88.2% (n = 622) of lunches were at ambient temperatures. Only 1.6% (n = 22) of perishable items (n = 1361) were in the safe temperature zone. Even with multiple ice packs, the majority of lunch items (&gt;90%) were at unsafe temperatures. CONCLUSIONS:: These results provide initial data on how frequently sack lunches sent by parents of preschool-aged children are kept at unsafe temperatures. Education of parents and the public must be focused on methods of packing lunches that allow the food to remain in the safe temperature zone to prevent foodborne illness.","https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-pdf/128/3/519/844419/zpe00911000519.pdf",""

Person-to-person contacts drive human disease dynamics. People value such contacts and are willing to accept some disease risk to gain contact-related benefits. The cost–benefit trade-offs that shape contact behavior, and hence the course of epidemics, are often only implicitly incorporated in epidemiological models. This approach creates difficulty in parsing out the effects of adaptive behavior. We use an epidemiological–economic model of disease dynamics to explicitly model the trade-offs that drive person-to-person contact decisions. Results indicate that including adaptive human behavior significantly changes the predicted course of epidemics and that this inclusion has implications for parameter estimation and interpretation and for the development of social distancing policies.

In the lung, TTF-1 controls the expression of surfactant proteins that are essential for lung stability and lung host defense. In this study, we identified functionally important transcription factor binding sites in the TTF-1 proximal promoter and studied tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) regulation of TTF-1 expression. TNF-α, a proinflammatory cytokine, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and inhibits surfactant protein levels. Deletion analysis of TTF-1 5′-flanking DNA indicated that the TTF-1 proximal promoter retained high-level activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and mutational analysis experiments identified functional ZBP-89, Sp1, Sp3, and TTF-1 sites in the TTF-1 proximal promoter. TNF-α inhibited TTF-1 protein levels in H441 and primary alveolar type II cells. TNF-α inhibited TTF-1 gene transcription and promoter activity, indicating that transcriptional mechanisms play important roles in the inhibition of TTF-1 levels. TNF-α inhibited TTF-1 but not Sp1 or hepatocyte nuclear factor-3 DNA binding to TTF-1 promoter. Transactivation experiments in A549 cells indicated that TNF-α inhibited TTF-1 promoter activation by exogenous Sp1 and TTF-1 without altering their levels, suggesting inhibition of transcriptional activities of these proteins. TNF-α inhibition of TTF-1 expression was associated with increased threonine, but not serine, phosphorylation of Sp1. Because TTF-1 serves as a positive regulator for surfactant protein gene expression, TNF-α inhibition of TTF-1 expression could have important implications for the reduction of surfactant protein levels in diseases such as ARDS.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajplung.00090.2011",""

The choice-dependent task involved learning how each choice influenced future rewards for two options and making the best decisions based on that knowledge.

It is unknown whether auscultatory and finger BP measures accurately reflect intra-arterial BP during dynamic changes in cardiac output and peripheral resistance associated with the aforementioned conditions. The purpose of this investigation was to test the hypothesis that auscultatory BP measured at the brachial artery, and finger BP measured by the Penaz method, are valid measures of intra-arterial BP during a passive heat stress and a heat-stressed orthostatic challenge, via lower body negative pressure (LBNP). Absolute (specific aim 1) and the change in (specific aim 2) systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), and mean BPs (MBP) were compared at normothermia, after a core temperature increase of 1.47 ± 0.09°C, and during subsequent LBNP. Heat stress did not change auscultatory SBP (6 ± 11 mmHg; P = 0.16), but Penaz SBP (−22 ± 16 mmHg; P < 0.001) and intra-arterial SBP (−11 ± 13 mmHg P = 0.017) decreased. In contrast, DBP and MBP did not differ between methods throughout heat stress. Compared with BP before LBNP, the magnitude of the reduction in BP with all three methods was similar throughout LBNP ( P > 0.05). In conclusion, auscultatory SBP and Penaz SBP failed to track the decrease in intra-arterial SBP that occurred during the profound heat stress, while decreases in arterial BP during an orthostatic challenge are comparable between methodologies.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpregu.00247.2011",""

Structures in remote locations or with limited accessibility make the requirements for these systems unique and challenging. For locations where connection to the power grid is difficult or impossible, monitoring system life is severely limited by battery technology. Alternatively, an energy harvesting power supply can make the monitoring system independent of the grid while increasing capabilities and lifetime beyond what is possible with current battery technology. This paper discusses a design and development methodology for developing energy harvesting aspects of a health monitoring system. The system comprises a sensor module that monitors the health of the structure, an on-site processing module that analyzes the data, and a wireless communication module that transmits the data. The method is demonstrated by examples of energy harvesting systems for a bridge monitoring application, using solar, wind, and vibration energy harvesters to provide power to a wireless network, local data processors, and strain gauges. Theoretical feasibility of energy harvesting in these domains has been previously demonstrated. The examples described in this paper validate the feasibility previously calculated as well as illustrate shortcomings in the current technology that inhibit potential implementation. The examples also show areas where innovation is needed to continue to advance the technology of energy harvesting in this application on infrastructure.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/DETC2011-48359/2774492/325_1.pdf",""

In this retrospective study, the authors determined the utility of EBUS-TBNA biopsy in the evaluation of mediastinal lymphadenopathy at a high-volume cancer center. Materials and Methods:: The pathology database was searched for all patients who had undergone EBUS-TBNA biopsy of mediastinal lymph nodes over a one-year period. Cytologic diagnoses were correlated with clinical histories, subsequent resection, and clinical follow-up data. Results:: Of 928 lymph node samples, 226 (24%) were diagnosed as malignant, 4 (0.4%) were suspicious for malignancy, 9 (1%) were atypical, 640 (69%) were benign, and 47 (5%) were insufficient for evaluation. In 89 (9.6%) cases, the patients had surgical resection. There was one false positive, in which the primary tumor contained infiltrating lymphocytes, had been sampled. There were five false-negative cases, which resulted from sampling errors, including two with micrometastases. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value rates for EBUS-TBNA biopsy in the evaluation of mediastinal lymph nodes were 68.7% and 98.6% and 91.6% and 93.5%, respectively on a per lymph node basis. The overall clinical sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value rates after one year clinical/radiological and histologic follow-up were 97%, 99.3%, 96.7% and 99.4%, respectively. Conclusions:: EBUS-TBNA biopsy is a sensitive and specific method for evaluating mediastinal lymphadenopathy in patients with lung and other primary tumors.","https://cytojournal.com/endobronchial-ultrasound-guided-transbronchial-needle-aspiration-biopsy-is-useful-evaluating-mediastinal-lymphadenopathy-in-a-cancer-center/",""

Two different types (contoured and line-of-sight distances) of a total of nine distances were computed from 3D images of each participant. Each participant was photographed twice, first without fiducial points marked (referred to as unmarked image) and second with fiducial points marked prior to imaging (referred to as marked image). Stereophotogrammetry was compared to traditional direct anthropometry, in which measurements were taken with a tape measure on participants. Three statistical analyses were used to evaluate the agreement between stereophotogrammetry and direct anthropometry. Seven out of nine distances showed excellent agreement between stereophotogrammetry and direct anthropometry (both marked and unmarked images). In addition, stereophotogrammetry from the unmarked image was equivalent to that of the marked image (both line-of-sight and contoured distances). A lower level of agreement was observed for some measures because of difficulty in localizing more vaguely defined fiducial points, such as lowest visible point of breast mound, and inability of the imaging system in capturing areas obscured by the breast, such as the inframammary fold. Stereophotogrammetry from 3D images obtained from the 3dMD torso system is effective for quantifying breast morphology. Tools for surgical planning and evaluation based on stereophotogrammetry have the potential to improve breast surgery outcomes.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.4137/BCBCR.S6352",""

Deformation of the bubble surfaces is taken into account by including quadrupole and octupole perturbations in the spherical-harmonic expansion of the boundary conditions on the bubbles. Quadratic terms in the quadrupole and octupole amplitudes are retained, and surface tension and shear viscosity are included in a consistent manner. A set of eight coupled second-order ordinary differential equations is obtained. Simulation results, obtained by numerical integration of the model equations, exhibit qualitative agreement with experimental observations by predicting the formation of liquid jets.

Design: Case series with chart review. Setting: Academic tertiary referral center and private practice. Subjects and Methods: 404 patients underwent ossiculoplasty using either Ti or HA implants from June 1996 to September 2008. Patient data were collected retrospectively from the senior author’s electronic database of surgical cases. Results: The change in air–bone gap (ΔABG) (defined as the difference between the means of preoperative and postoperative ABG) was 9.9 dB for the HA group that received partial ossicular reconstruction prosthesis (PORP), 9.5 dB for the Ti PORP group, 12.3 dB for the Ti group that received total ossicular reconstruction prosthesis (TORP), and 10.0 dB for the HA TORP group. There was no statistically significant difference between the HA and Ti groups. There was no significant difference in hearing results between canal wall up (CWU) and canal wall down (CWD) cases in which mastoidectomy was performed. Four confounding factors (preoperative otorrhea, preoperative perforation, cholesteatoma, mastoidectomy performed) were analyzed using regression analysis. In the Ti PORP group, the presence of cholesteatoma was found to have a significant negative bias for hearing results. Conclusion: No statistically significant differences in hearing results were found between the HA and the Ti partial and total ossiculoplasty prostheses. No outcome difference was found between CWU versus CWD mastoidectomy groups for any type of implant used. A randomized, prospective study is necessary for a more definitive comparison of efficacy between HA and Ti OCR implants.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0194599811399738",""

This paper aims to offer a framework for modeling workers’ participation in and travel mileage allocated to non-work activities during various time periods of the day. Five time-of-day blocks are defined for workers on the basis of the period of the day in relation to the work schedule. Individuals can choose to pursue nonwork activities in one or multiple time blocks and travel miles to accomplish the activities. A multiple discrete-continuous extreme value modeling approach is used to model this phenomenon. A unique element of the paper is the addition of a latent choice set generation model as a first component in the model system. This choice set generation model can be used to determine the set of time-of-day periods that each individual will consider for the pursuit of nonwork activities, while recognizing that the consideration choice set is not explicitly observed (and is therefore latent) by the analyst. Thus, the model system presented in this paper is capable of modeling nonwork activity engagement and associated travel mileage by time-of-day period while incorporating varying choice sets across individuals. The two-component model system is applied to a survey sample drawn from the San Francisco area in California and shown to perform substantially better than a pure multiple discrete-continuous extreme value model that assumes a constant choice set across the sample.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/2254-15",""

We previously reported a potential role of tissue-derived IGF in lung tumor formation and progression. However, the role of IGF-binding protein (IGFBP)-3, a major IGFBP, on the activity of tissue-driven IGF in lung cancer development is largely unknown. Here, we show that IGF-I, but not IGF-II, protein levels in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were significantly higher than those in normal and hyperplastic bronchial epithelium. We found that IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels in NSCLC tissue specimens were significantly correlated with phosphorylated IGF-IR (pIGF-IR) expression. We investigated the impact of IGFBP-3 expression on the activity of tissue-driven IGF-I in lung cancer development using mice carrying lung-specific human IGF-I transgene (Tg), a germline-null mutation of IGFBP-3, or both. Compared with wild-type (BP3+/+) mice, mice carrying heterozygous (BP3+/−) or homozygous (BP3−/−) deletion of IGFBP-3 alleles exhibited decreases in circulating IGFBP-3 and IGF-I. Unexpectedly, IGFTg mice with 50% of physiological IGFBP-3 (BP3+/−; IGFTg) showed higher levels of pIGF-IR/IR and a greater degree of spontaneous or tobacco carcinogen [4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone]-induced lung tumor development and progression than did the IGFTg mice with normal (BP3+/+;IGFTg) or homozygous deletion of IGFBP-3 (BP3−/−; IGFTg). These data show that IGF-I is overexpressed in NSCLC, leading to activation of IGF-IR, and that IGFBP-3, depending on its expression level, either inhibits or potentiates IGF-I actions in lung carcinogenesis.","http://academic.oup.com/endo/article-pdf/152/6/2164/9036894/endo2164.pdf",""

In order to quantify the effect of pose, we introduce a new measure; the 3D pBRA (Percentage Breast Retraction Assessment) index, and validate its use against the 2D pBRA index. Our data suggests that the 3D pBRA index is linearly correlated with the 2D counterpart for both of the poses, and is independent of the localization of fiducial points within a tolerance limit of 7 mm. The quantitative assessment of 3D asymmetry was found to be invariant of subject pose. This study further corroborates the advantages of 3D stereophotogrammetry over 2D photography.

This paper describes the modeling and simulation of biological reactions associated with the injection of nitrate to inhibit reservoir souring.

However, despite the considerable uncertainty associated with forecasting shale gas production, these authors either do not quantify the reserves uncertainty in shale gas wells or fail to demonstrate that their probabilistic forecasts are well calibrated. Jochen and Spivey (1996) and Cheng et al.(2010) developed bootstrap methods that can generate probabilistic decline forecasts and quantify reserves uncertainty. Forecasts with the Modified Bootstrap Method (Cheng et al. 2010) provide good coverage of the true reserves. However, it is not time efficient because it requires hundreds of Newton iterations for each well. In this work, we introduce a Bayesian methodology for probabilistic decline curve analysis that quantifies reserves uncertainty reliably, quickly, and without modifying the historical production data. We analyzed 167 horizontal gas wells with more than 7 years of production in the Barnett shale to validate the methodology.","http://onepetro.org/SPEURCC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/147588-MS/1677790/spe-147588-ms.pdf",""

The study considers the two-dimensional plane and the surface of a sphere, both of which have been studied before, but here time is introduced to the problem. Such models have a finite characteristic length (roughly the separation at which the autocorrelation falls to 1/e) and a relaxation time scale. In particular, the characteristic length of a particular temporal Fourier component of the field increases to a finite value as the frequency of the particular component decreases. Some near-analytical formulas are provided for the results. A potential application is to the correlation structure of surface temperature fields and to the estimation of large area averages, depending on how the original datastream is filtered into a distribution of Fourier frequencies (e.g., moving average, low pass, or narrow band). The form of the governing equation is just that of the simple energy balance climate models, which have a long history in climate studies. The physical motivation provided by the derivation from a climate model provides some heuristic appeal to the approach and suggests extensions of the work to nonuniform cases.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jcli/article-pdf/24/22/5850/3981023/2011jcli4199_1.pdf",""

A broad array of mostly extracellular stimuli has been reported to activate NF-κB, to various degrees, in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. Because CLL cells harbor high levels of unphosphorylated STAT-3 (USTAT-3) and USTAT-3 was reported to activate NF-κB, we sought to determine whether USTAT-3 activates NF-κB in CLL. Using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), we studied peripheral blood low-density cells from 15 patients with CLL and found that CLL cell nuclear extracts from all the samples bound to an NF-κB DNA probe, suggesting that NF-κB is constitutively activated in CLL. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that STAT-3 bound NF-κB p65, and confocal microscopy studies detected USTAT-3/NF-κB complexes in the nuclei of CLL cells, thereby confirming these findings. Furthermore, infection of CLL cells with retroviral STAT-3-short hairpin RNA attenuated the binding of NF-κB to DNA, as assessed by EMSA, and downregulated mRNA levels of NF-κB–regulated genes, as assessed by quantitative PCR. Taken together, our data suggest that USTAT-3 binds to the NF-κB p50/p65 dimers and that the USTAT-3/NF-κB complexes bind to DNA and activate NF-κB–regulated genes in CLL cells.

To start with, the permeability field is parameterized using a novel grid-connectivity-based transformation basis that can be applied with any model geometry including unstructured and corner-point grids. The parameterization basis functions emerge from spectral decomposition of the grid-connectivity Laplacian and are related to the structural harmonics of the grid. To reconcile data with model resolution during history matching, we first use the coarsest scale basis functions to identify the large scale variability. Additional smaller-scale basis elements are then adaptively incorporated to successively refine the model to a level supported by data resolution. During refinement, the inclusion of more detailed basis functions into the parameterization is determined by generic modal frequency when the prior model is unavailable, or using prior information when available. In the final step of the workflow a streamline-based inversion is performed to locally adjust the reservoir model at grid-cell resolution along coarse scale preferential flow paths defined during the previous step using the parameterization.","http://onepetro.org/spersc/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/141764-MS/1694392/spe-141764-ms.pdf",""

The structural parameters examined in this research include channel plate dimensions and heat transfer coefficients. The membrane properties studied include membrane vapor transfer properties described in the Arrhenius’ equation.

Objective.: To compare the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate of patients treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) versus dose-intense FAC plus G-CSF in the neoadjuvant setting and to compare the delivered dose intensity, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) times, and toxicity between treatment arms in patients with breast cancer. Methods.: Patients were randomized to receive preoperative FAC (5-FU, 500 mg/m2; doxorubicin, 50 mg/m2; cyclophosphamide, 500 mg/m2) every 21 days for four cycles or dose-intense FAC (5-FU, 600 mg/m2; doxorubicin, 60 mg/m2; cyclophosphamide, 1,000 mg/m2) plus G-CSF every 18 days for four cycles. Results.: Two hundred two patients were randomly assigned. The median follow-up was 7.5 years. Patients randomized to FAC plus G-CSF had a higher pCR rate as well as clinical complete response rate; however, these differences were not statistically different from those with the FAC arm. Patients in the FAC + G-CSF arm had a higher delivered dose intensity of doxorubicin in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings than those in the standard FAC arm. DFS and OS times were not significantly different between the two groups. However, the OS and DFS rates were significantly higher for patients who achieved a pCR than for those who did not. Thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia, and infection rates were higher in the FAC + G-CSF arm. Conclusions.: A higher delivered dose intensity of doxorubicin with the FAC + G-CSF regimen did not result in a statistically significant higher pCR rate.

Treatment with ARRY-520 arrests cells in mitosis with subsequent onset of apoptosis due to degradation of survival signals during mitotic arrest. While immunomodulators [IMiDs] and proteasome inhibitors have improved outcomes in MM, patients with MM that is refractory to both bortezomib (BTZ) and thalidomide (THAL) or lenalidomide (LEN) have a poor prognosis with median survival of 9 months. Since ARRY-520 is a novel agent with a unique mechanism of action (MOA) relative to current standard-of-care (SOC) agents, it might be expected to show activity in patients refractory to other drugs. Preclinically, ARRY-520 showed activity in BTZ-refractory models, suggesting prior treatments may not predict patient response to ARRY-520. Methods:: This Phase 2 study was designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and biological effects of 1.5 mg/m2/day ARRY-520 administered intravenously on Days 1 and 2 every 2 weeks with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support. Eligible patients had relapsed or refractory MM with ≥ 2 prior lines of therapy (including both BTZ and an IMiD), unless refusing or ineligible for this therapy. Results:: Thirty-two patients have been treated, with a median age of 65 years (range 51–82) and a median of 5 prior regimens (n = 31; range 2–20). Twenty-eight patients received prior BTZ, 28 patients prior LEN, 17 patients prior THAL and 25 patients had an autologous stem cell transplant. One patient has been lost to follow-up. Conclusions:: ARRY-520 is a novel agent with a differentiated MOA relative to other myeloma drugs. ARRY-520 shows promising evidence of single-agent clinical activity and an acceptable safety profile in heavily pretreated patients with MM. Notably, ARRY-520 has demonstrated activity in patients refractory to both LEN and BTZ, a population with limited treatment options. An expansion cohort is planned in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ARRY-520 in combination with dexamethasone in patients who are refractory to their last myeloma treatment and refractory to prior LEN, BTZ and dexamethasone.

In this study, we discuss the possibility to augment the detection of prostate cancer using a dual-modality optical approach, which can be coupled with the current needle biopsy setup. Two techniques are light reflectance spectroscopy (LRS) that uses a broadband light source and a CCD array spectrometer, and auto-fluorescence lifetime measurement (AFLM) that uses a custom-designed, time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) system. Both LRS and AFLM were employed sequentially in this study to measure cancer tissue along with control tissue on a rat prostate tumor model. At an excitation wavelength of 447 nm, we investigated auto-fluorescence decay curves at the emission wavelengths of 532, 562, 632 and 684 nm for in vivo and ex vivo AFLM. These results show that auto-fluorescence lifetimes at all measured emission wavelengths differ between control and cancerous tissues with 100% specificity and sensitivity. Moreover, absolute values of hemoglobin derivatives and scattering coefficient were quantified using in vivo LRS. This part of study also demonstrates that light scattering and absorption are significantly different between the control and cancerous tissue. Overall, the study demonstrates that both LRS and AFLM may provide several intrinsic biomarkers for in vivo detection of prostate cancer.","https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S179354581100154X",""

A broad array of mostly extracellular stimuli has been reported to activate NF-κB, to various degrees, in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. Because CLL cells harbor high levels of unphosphorylated STAT-3 (USTAT-3) and USTAT-3 was reported to activate NF-κB, we sought to determine whether USTAT-3 activates NF-κB in CLL. Using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), we studied peripheral blood low-density cells from 15 patients with CLL and found that CLL cell nuclear extracts from all the samples bound to an NF-κB DNA probe, suggesting that NF-κB is constitutively activated in CLL. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that STAT-3 bound NF-κB p65, and confocal microscopy studies detected USTAT-3/NF-κB complexes in the nuclei of CLL cells, thereby confirming these findings. Furthermore, infection of CLL cells with retroviral STAT-3-short hairpin RNA attenuated the binding of NF-κB to DNA, as assessed by EMSA, and downregulated mRNA levels of NF-κB–regulated genes, as assessed by quantitative PCR. Taken together, our data suggest that USTAT-3 binds to the NF-κB p50/p65 dimers and that the USTAT-3/NF-κB complexes bind to DNA and activate NF-κB–regulated genes in CLL cells.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 522 Mexican American subjects participated in this study. Each subject received a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) after a 10- to 12-h overnight fast. Insulin sensitivity was assessed with the Matsuda index. Insulin secretory rate was quantitated from deconvolution of the plasma C-peptide concentration. β-Cell function was assessed with the insulin secretion/insulin resistance (IS/IR) (disposition) index and was related to the level of HbA1c. RESULTS: At HbA1c levels &lt;5.5%, both the Matsuda index of insulin sensitivity and IS/IR index were constant. However, as the HbA1c increased &gt;5.5%, there was a precipitous decrease in both the Matsuda index and the IS/IR index. Subjects with HbA1c = 6.0–6.4% had a 44 and 74% decrease in the Matsuda index and the IS/IR index, respectively, compared with subjects with HbA1c &lt;5.5% (P &lt; 0.01 for both indices). Subjects with normal glucose tolerance and HbA1c &lt;5.7% had β-cell function comparable to that of subjects with normal glucose tolerance with HbA1c = 5.7–6.4%. However, subjects with impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance had a marked decrease in β-cell function independent of their HbA1c level. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study demonstrate that in Mexican Americans, as HbA1c increases &gt;6.0%, both insulin sensitivity and β-cell function decrease markedly. Performing an OGTT is pivotal for accurate identification of subjects with impaired β-cell function.","https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/34/4/1006/608261/1006.pdf",""

For each method, the underlying theory of the interpretation, and one or more field examples are presented. The most fundamental well property that can often be obtained from a temperature profile is the well's inflow profile - the locations and relative rates of inflow along the well. Simple analytical methods for interpreting the flow profiles of vertical oil producing wells are presented along with examples of this interpretation.","http://onepetro.org/SPEATCE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/147448-MS/1661332/spe-147448-ms.pdf",""

Methods.: We retrospectively analyzed the records of 316 women who presented to MD Anderson Cancer Center in 1989–2008 with newly diagnosed IBC without distant metastases. Most patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, mastectomy, and postmastectomy radiation. Patients were grouped according to receptor status: ER+ (ER+/PR+ and HER-2−; n = 105), ER+HER-2+ (ER+/PR+ and HER-2+; n = 37), HER-2+ (ER−/PR− and HER-2+; n = 83), or triple-negative (TN) (ER−PR−HER-2−; n = 91).

OS and LRR rates were worse for TN patients than for any other subgroup (p &lt; .0001–.03). Conclusions.: TN disease is associated with worse OS, DR, and LRR outcomes in IBC patients, indicating the need for developing new locoregional and systemic treatment strategies for patients with this aggressive subtype.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1634/theoncologist.2011-0196",""

Marketing Sci. 27(3) 324–333] found that, in the refrigerated orange juice category, a model with cross-brand pass-through was selected 68% of the time. However, Lenk [Lenk, P. J. 2009. Simulation pseudo-bias correction to the harmonic mean estimator of integrated likelihoods. J. Comput. Graph. Statist. 18(1) 941–960] has demonstrated that the infinite variance harmonic mean estimator often exhibits simulation pseudo-bias in favor of more complex models. We replicate the results of Dubé and Gupta in the refrigerated orange juice category and then show that any of three more stable finite variance estimators select the model with cross-brand pass-through less than 1% of the time. Relaxing the assumption that model errors are distributed normally eliminates all instances in which the cross-brand pass-through model is selected. In 10 additional categories, the harmonic-mean-estimated Bayes factor selects the model with cross-brand pass-through 69% of the time, whereas a finite variance estimator of the Bayes factor selects the model with cross-brand pass-through only 5% of the time. Applying arguments in McAlister [McAlister, L. 2007. Cross-brand pass-through: Fact or artifact? Marketing Sci. 26(6) 876–898], these 5% of cases can be attributed to capitalization on chance.

Sulfur has a large impact on contact resistivity for silicon with low initial doping concentration (&lt;∼1017 cm−3), but little impact for silicon with high initial doping density (&gt;∼1017 cm−3).

We previously found that the term “palliative care” was perceived by oncology professionals as a barrier to early patient referral. We aimed to determine whether a service name change to supportive care was associated with earlier referrals. Patients and Methods.: Records of 4,701 consecutive patients with a first palliative care consultation before (January 2006 to August 2007) and after (January 2008 to August 2009) the name change were analyzed, including demographics and dates of first registration to hospital, advanced cancer diagnosis, palliative care consultation, and death. One-sample proportions tests, median tests, χ2 tests, and log-rank tests were used to identify group differences. Results.: The median age was 59 years, 50% were male, and 90% had solid tumors. After the name change, we found: (a) a 41% greater number of palliative care consultations (1,950 versus 2,751 patients; p &lt; .001), mainly as a result of a rise in inpatient referrals (733 versus 1,451 patients; p &lt; .001), and (b) in the outpatient setting, a shorter duration from hospital registration to palliative care consultation (median, 9.2 months versus 13.2 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; p &lt; .001) and from advanced cancer diagnosis to palliative care consultation (5.2 months versus 6.9 months; HR, 0.82; p &lt; .001), and a longer overall survival duration from palliative care consultation (median 6.2 months versus 4.7 months; HR, 1.21; p &lt; .001). Conclusion.: The name change to supportive care was associated with more inpatient referrals and earlier referrals in the outpatient setting. The outpatient setting facilitates earlier access to supportive/palliative care and should be established in more centers.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1634/theoncologist.2010-0161",""

To measure mechanical properties of the medium, dynamics of a laser-induced cavitation microbubble in viscoelastic medium under acoustic radiation force was investigated. An objective lens with a 1.13 numerical aperture and an 8.0 mm working distance was designed to focus a 532 nm wavelength nanosecond pulsed laser beam and to create a microbubble at the desired location. A 3.5 MHz ultrasound transducer was used to generate acoustic radiation force to excite a laser-induced microbubble. Motion of the microbubble was tracked using a 25 MHz imaging transducer. Agreement between a theoretical model of bubble motion in a viscoelastic medium and experimental measurements was demonstrated. Young’s modulii reconstructed using the laser-induced microbubble approach were compared with those measured using a direct uniaxial method over the range from 0.8 to 13 kPa. The results indicate good agreement between methods.

However, little is known about the mechanism and control of de novo telomere formation (DNTF). DNTF can be instigated by the insertion of a telomere repeat array (TRA) into the host genome, which seeds the formation of a new telomere, resulting in chromosome truncation. Such events are rare and concentrated at chromosome ends. Here, we introduce tetraploid Arabidopsis thaliana as a robust genetic model for DNTF. Transformation of a 2.6-kb TRA into tetraploid plants resulted in a DNTF efficiency of 56%, fivefold higher than in diploid plants and 50-fold higher than in human cells. DNTF events were recovered across the entire genome, indicating that genetic redundancy facilitates recovery of DNTF events. Although TRAs as short as 100 bp seeded new telomeres, these tracts were unstable unless they were extended above a 1-kb size threshold. Unexpectedly, DNTF efficiency increased in plants lacking telomerase, and DNTF rates were lower in plants null for Ku70 or Lig4, components of the nonhomologous end-joining repair pathway. We conclude that multiple competing pathways modulate DNTF, and that tetraploid Arabidopsis will be a powerful model for elucidating the molecular details of these processes.","http://academic.oup.com/plcell/article-pdf/23/6/2263/36936081/plcell_v23_6_2263.pdf",""

We examined this issue in rat GnRH neurons with biocytin filling in live hypothalamic slices from infant males, as adult littermates and in gonad-intact males, castrated males, and in males with one of three levels of testosterone (T) treatment. Somatic area and total dendritic length were significantly greater in infant males than in adults. Moreover, total numbers of dendrite branches were greater in infant males as compared with adults. The number of higher order branches and the lengths of higher order branches were also greater in infant males than in adults. Most interestingly, in adults a single dendrite arose from the somata, consistently at 180° from the axon. In contrast, prepubertal animals had an average of 2.2 ± 0.2 primary dendrites arising from somata (range, one to seven primary dendrites). Angles relative to the axon at which dendrites in prepubertal males emanated from GnRH somata were highly variable. Castration at 25 d of age and castration at 25 d of age with one of three levels of T treatment did not influence morphological parameters when GnRH neurons were examined between 40 d and 48 d of age.

These guidelines, implemented since July 2007, encourage the reuse of cash by (i) penalizing a DI for the practice of cross shipping, the near-simultaneous deposit of used cash to—and withdrawal of fit cash from—the Fed; and (ii) offering a custodial inventory program that enables a DI to transfer fit cash to the Fed's books, but physically hold it within the DI's secured facility. The effective management of the inventory of cash under these new guidelines is both a challenging and important issue for DIs. We introduce two new multiperiod models—designed specifically to capture the operations of a medium-size DI—that emerge from the DI's objective to minimize the total cost incurred in managing the inventory of cash over a finite planning horizon. The Basic Model (BM) captures the DI's mode of operations if it chooses not to locally reuse cash and, instead, incur the cross-shipping penalty. Using two important structural properties, we provide a polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm for BM. The Reuse Model (RM) represents the DI's actions when it locally recirculates cash. We first prove the hardness of RM and then develop an integer programming formulation. A comprehensive test bed—based on our interaction with a leading secure-logistics provider—helps us to develop several useful insights into the relative impacts of the DI-specific parameters and the Fed's cross-shipping fee on the effective management of cash. In particular, we show that the Value of Local Reuse for a DI, measured as the percentage cost saving between the optimal solutions of BM and RM, is substantial, and we analyze the forces that influence the volume of cross shipping. We also develop a rolling-horizon procedure to adapt the optimal solutions of BM and RM for obtaining near-optimal real-time solutions in the presence of a modest amount of uncertainty. Finally, we provide a comparative analysis of a DI's decisions under the Fed's mechanism and those under a socially optimal mechanism.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/msom.1110.0336",""

The precision with which the prototype helps a client assess his requirements depends on (a) the type of prototype provided by the vendor and (b) the client's feedback effort. The vendor can provide either a neutral or nonneutral prototype: The nonneutral prototype influences the client towards one particular set of requirements that may not be the true requirement, and the neutral prototype allows the client to assess his true requirements. This leads to the vendor's moral hazard problem. The client chooses to exert either the high or low feedback effort after the vendor provides the prototype. Because the effort is unobservable to the vendor, it can lead to the client exerting the low feedback effort: the client's commitment problem. In this paper we develop and discuss the role of the contract payment to provide the vendor with incentives to supply the neutral prototype, as well as for the client to commit to the high feedback effort. In this setting, we also examine the “anchoring” effect, wherein even a high-feedback effort can influence the client more toward a particular set of requirements with the nonneutral prototype. Our results highlight the interplay among the feedback effort, anchoring, and vendor payments.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/isre.1090.0248",""

Two different ionic liquid solutions were prepared with 6 wt% of bagasse cellulose and 6 wt% of wood cellulose. The solutions were extruded with a dry-jet and wet-spinning method using water as a coagulation bath. A thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) was used to measure the thermal properties of these regenerated fibers. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was used to determine the thermal mechanical property of the regenerated cellulose fibers and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) was used to measure the degree of crystallinity, as well as the degree of crystal orientation for those experimental fibers. To evaluate the quantity of ionic liquid residue in the regenerated fibers, the instrumental methods of FT-IR and mass spectrometry were applied to test the residues of BMIMCl in the regenerated fibers. Research results indicated increases in the degree of crystallinity and storage modulus under a higher fiber drawing speed. Both regenerated bagasse film and regenerated wood film had similar thermal properties. However, the regenerated bagasse fibers showed a higher degree of crystallinity, and higher tenacity than the regenerated wood fibers obtained under the same condition.

We hypothesized women would have an attenuated vasomotor sympathetic response to static exercise, which would be further reduced during the high sex hormone [midluteal (ML)] vs. the low hormone phase [early follicular (EF)]. We measured heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) in 11 women and 10 men during a cold pressor test (CPT) and static handgrip to fatigue with 2 min of postexercise circulatory arrest (PECA). HR increased during handgrip, reached its peak at fatigue, and was comparable between sexes. BP increased during handgrip and PECA where men had larger increases from baseline. Mean ± SD MSNA burst frequency (BF) during handgrip and PECA was lower in women (EF, P < 0.05), as was ΔMSNA-BF smaller (main effect, both P < 0.01).

The purpose of this meta-analysis was to determine the effectiveness of immune-enhancing enteral nutrition as compared with standard enteral nutrition, with respect to mortality and change in oxygenation status, in patients with acute lung injury (ALI)/ARDS. Methods: A systematic review was conducted of randomized controlled trials comparing immune-enhancing enteral nutrition with standard enteral nutrition in adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients with ALI/ARDS. Data were combined in a meta-analysis with STATA SE version 9.2 (StataCorp) using a random effects model. Results: Three studies fulfilled inclusion criteria, totaling 411 patients. These studies demonstrated a statistically significant relative risk (RR) for in-hospital mortality, favoring patients who received immune-enhancing enteral nutrition (RR, 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42-0.79). With respect to change in oxygenation status, a statistically significant standardized mean difference (SMD) was observed at day 4 (SMD, 1.97; 95% CI, 0.27-3.67), favoring the immune-enhancing enteral nutrition group. At study day 7, the SMD did not reach statistical significance (SMD, 1.71; 95% CI, −0.13 to 3.56). Conclusions: Oxygenation and mortality benefits of immune-enhancing enteral nutrition in adult ICU patients with ALI/ARDS have been shown in individual trials and meta-analyses. Subsequent clinical trials and meta-analyses are required to fully elucidate the role of immune-enhancing enteral nutrition in this patient population.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1310/hpj4601-33",""

To address this, investigators have used a variety of tumor models in which MSCs are added exogenously to determine their impact on tumor development. Interestingly, many studies have reported contradicting results, with some investigators finding that MSCs promote tumor growth and others reporting that MSCs inhibit tumor growth. Many mechanisms have been reported to account for these observations, such as chemokine signaling, modulation of apoptosis, vascular support, and immune modulation. In this review, we analyzed the differences in the methodology of the studies reported and found that the timing of MSC introduction into tumors may be a critical element. Understanding the conditions in which MSCs enhance tumor growth and metastasis is crucial, both to safely develop MSCs as a therapeutic tool and to advance our understanding of the role of tumor stroma in carcinogenesis.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/stem.559",""

Spent acid needs to be fully mobilized and recovered in order to enhance gas production. Wettability of the rocks and capillary forces are the main reason behind fluid trapping in carbonate formations. These forces can be weakened by decreasing surface tension and increasing contact angle. Additives that are injected along with the acid can have an impact on changing the surface tension, contact angle and possibly the wettability of the rocks. Previously, separate studies were conducted on the effect of acid additives on contact angle and surface tension. However, there is still a need to investigate the overall impact of acid additives on these two parameters and wettability on the trapping of spent acid in the carbonate rocks.","http://onepetro.org/SPEEURO/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/142948-MS/1697597/spe-142948-ms.pdf",""

The intrinsic gap states are mainly originated from Ga dangling bonds, partial Ga-oxidation, and As−As dimers in the reconstructed interface structures. Si passivation interlayer can introduce two types of Si local bonding configuration of Si interstitial or substitutional defects (SiHf). SiHf–passivated interfaces are found to be energetically stable and can suppress the interfacial flat bandgap state stemming from partial Ga-oxidation into the valence band of bulk GaAs. Furthermore, gap states near the conduction bandedge are partially reduced. With the increase of Si concentration at the interface, the charge state of interfacial Ga decreases from +1.26 to between +0.73 and +0.80, and this change shows a Ga oxidation state transformation from Ga2O3 (+1.7) to Ga2O (+0.52) states. The metastable Si interstitials also eliminate Ga2O3-oxidation state and creates Ga2O-like Ga charge state at the interface. However, the gap states near the conduction bandedge cannot be passivated by substitutional (SiHf) nor by interstitial (Sii) silicon. The detailed nature of the gap states examined in this modeling study would facilitate further development of interface passivation and the optimization of Si-passivation layers.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.3554689/15069296/063704_1_online.pdf",""
