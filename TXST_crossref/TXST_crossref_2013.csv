The proposed model is driven by a simplified pulse-step neuronal control signal and makes use of linear simplifications to account for the unique characteristics of the eye globe and the extraocular muscles responsible for horizontal and vertical eye movement. The linear nature of the model sacrifices some anatomical accuracy for computational speed and analytic tractability, and may be implemented as two one-dimensional models for parallel signal simulation. Practical applications of the model might include improved noise reduction and signal recovery facilities for eye tracking systems, additional metrics from which to determine user effort during usability testing, and enhanced security in biometric identification systems. The results indicate that the model is capable of produce oblique saccades with properties resembling those of normal human saccades and is capable of deriving muscle constants that are viable as biometric indicators. Therefore, we conclude that sacrifice in the anatomical accuracy of the model produces negligible effects on the accuracy of saccadic simulation on a 2D plane and may provide a usable model for applications in computer science, human-computer interaction, and related fields.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2536764.2536774",""

Mean caloric intake exceeded DRI recommendations by 50% and 16% among infants 4–6 and 6–12 mo, respectively. Usual intake of zinc exceeded the UL in all age groups. Usual intake of vitamin E was less than the RDA in 85% of toddlers 12–24 mo. Usual intake of calcium was less than the RDA in 100% of toddlers 12–24 mo.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a high-intensity wildfire around pond edges on red imported fire ant captures in the Lost Pines ecoregion of Texas, which provides habitat for most of the remaining endangered Houston toads Bufo houstonensis. The red imported fire ant is a known predator of Houston toads, and thus there is interest in understanding the potential and realized impacts of this species on Houston toad survivorship. Our results suggest the wildfire did not directly impact captures-per-unit-effort, but it had indirect positive impacts through reductions in canopy cover due to overstory tree mortality. The results of this study indicate that both area occupied by red imported fire ants and site-specific red imported fire ant densities could increase dramatically in the Lost Pines as a result of the wildfire and subsequent human-based recovery efforts.","https://meridian.allenpress.com/jfwm/article-pdf/4/1/129/2925109/012013-jfwm-004.pdf",""

Differences in diet quality of selected forage have been noted in size-dimorphic ungulates. However, on an intraspecific basis, data demonstrating a body size influence on diet quality are lacking. We examined diet quality across a range of body masses (14–76 kg) in white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus (n  =  108) in a 2,628-ha enclosure at Kerr Wildlife Management Area, Kerr County, Texas, USA. The quality of the diet consumed was determined by crude protein, acid detergent fiber, and neutral detergent fiber content of digesta in the rumen–reticulum. Results indicated that in relation to body mass, the ratio of crude protein to acid detergent fiber was greater for smaller bodied white-tailed deer. By consuming a diet higher in crude protein than did large bodied individuals, small-bodied individuals should meet their high mass-specific metabolic demands more efficiently. Furthermore, selective foraging by different-sized individuals might also reduce intraspecific competition. Information presented herein is relevant to wildlife managers in that by increasing available high-quality forage, small-bodied individuals will more efficiently meet their metabolic demands, which could have ramifications on recruitment within that population.","https://meridian.allenpress.com/jfwm/article-pdf/4/1/53/2925393/092012-jfwm-085.pdf",""

Objective: To assess the number of respiratory therapists who are aware of the organ donor referral criteria and their attitude toward organ donation before and after an organ procurement organization provided an educational course. Design: A retrospective analysis of surveys following an educational course. Setting: Hospital respiratory therapy departments within the Texas Organ Sharing Alliance northern region. Participants: Respiratory therapists who attended the educational course. Main Outcome Measure(s): Measured outcomes were respiratory therapists' attitude scores before and after the organ procurement organization provided the educational course, the number of organ donor cases experienced during the respiratory therapists' careers, the unit(s) of the hospital in which the respiratory therapists worked, and the respiratory therapists' awareness of the organ donor referral criteria before the organ procurement organization provided the educational course. Results: Seventy-seven respiratory therapists were surveyed. Sixty-two respiratory therapists identified themselves as working in a critical care setting and 58% stated they were unaware of the donor referral criteria. Seventeen respiratory therapists reported their attitude toward organ donation improved with no perception decline. Using the Wilcoxon signed rank test for statistical analysis, the mean attitude score after the education course was significantly different at an alpha level of 0.05 ( P < .01) than the mean attitude score before the course.

Analysis indicated that the two teachers enacted the practice in distinct ways based on their experiences and personal characteristics. Findings further suggested that, reminiscent of research on ability groups conducted mainly in the 1970s and 1980s, instruction and materials in both classrooms were qualitatively different between lower groups and higher groups.

Concomitant ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic (AF) behavior is demonstrated in single crystal BiFeO3 (BFO) films grown on 20 nm SrTiO3 (STO) virtual substrates on Si(100) using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). STO thin films are grown in an oxide MBE chamber by co-deposition of Sr, Ti, and molecular O2. Careful control of the O2 during nucleation produced commensurate growth of STO on Si. The sequence of the steps allows for the suppression of an amorphous SiO2 layer. This STO(20 nm)/Si structure was used as a virtual substrate for MBE deposition of BFO on Si without breaking vacuum. BFO was deposited using Fe and O2 plasma with an overpressure of Bi flux, the growth rate was controlled by the incoming Fe flux. The reflection high energy electron diffraction image shows a 2-D growth front with a 6-fold surface reconstruction under optimized O2 pressure of 5 × 10−8 mbar. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirms the high crystallinity of the films and shows sharp, atomically flat interfaces. The selected area diffraction pattern (SADP) reveals that BFO grows in a distorted rhombohedral crystal structure. X-ray diffraction does not show formation of second phases and is consistent with the TEM and SADP results. The BFO films show AF behavior with a Neel temperature that exceeds 350 K, as expected (TN = 673 K) and with a residual ferromagnetic behavior that decreases with film thickness and is consistent with the G-type AF due to the canted spins. The saturation magnetization per unit volume for a 40 nm thick film was 180 emu/cm3 at an in-plane magnetic field of 8 kOe. The ferroelectric behavior of the films was verified using piezoresponse force microscopy.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.4796150/7909494/17d919_1_online.pdf",""

In spite of intensive efforts, there has been thus far, no report of proven application. The object of this research is to understand the reason for this lack of success and to find ways to overcome this limitation. Reported herein is the synthesis of our research in ceramic processing of this material and its characterization, particularly with the objective of identifying potential applications. Experimental results have shown that CCTO's permittivity and loss tangent, the two most essential dielectric parameters of fundamental importance for the efficiency of a capacitor device, are intrinsically coupled. They increase or decrease in tandem. Therefore, efforts to simultaneously retain the high permittivity while minimizing the loss tangent of CCTO might not succeed unless an entirely non-typical approach is taken for processing this material. Based on the experimental results and their analysis, it has been identified that it is possible to produce CCTO bulk ceramics with conventional processes having properties that can be exploited for fabricating an efficient energy storage device (EDS). We have additionally identified that CCTO can be used for the development of efficient solid state capacitors of Class II type comparable to the widely used barium titanate (BT) capacitors. Based on high temperature studies of the resistivity and the Seebeck coefficient it is found that CCTO is a wide bandgap n-type semiconductor material which could be used for high temperature electronics. The temperature dependence of the linear thermal expansion of CCTO shows the presence of possible phase changes at 220 and 770 °C the origin of which remains unexplained.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/adv/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.4812709/12848367/062126_1_online.pdf",""

A simple method was developed to estimate fractional snow cover using freely available Landsat and data derived from DEMs, commercial and free software, as well as fuzzy classification and recursive partitioning. The authors attempted to develop a cost effective technique for estimating fractional snow cover for resource and recreation managers confined by limited budgets and resources.

METHODS: Cases of tracheoesophageal fistula and/or esophageal atresia were selected from the Texas Birth Defects Registry, and live births from Texas birth certificate data. All were delivered in 1999 through 2009. Data on infant and maternal characteristics were taken from the vital record. Four approaches were compared: a cohort design using Poisson regression (PR) and three case–control analyses using logistic regression (LR) with 10 controls per case (LR10), four controls per case (LR4), or affected controls having other birth defects. Analyses were conducted for all 11 years and for just 1 year (2009). RESULTS: Using all 11 years, there were 869 cases of tracheoesophageal fistula and/or esophageal atresia, and results for PR, LR10, and LR4 were similar. Results using only 2009 were more divergent: PR yielded more statistically significant global tests (type III analyses) and narrower 95% confidence intervals, followed closely by LR10. For both time periods, results using affected controls were different from those using PR and LR. CONCLUSION: For these descriptive epidemiologic analyses, PR yielded the most precise estimates. However, LR provided similar estimates, and using 10 controls per case yielded precision almost as good as PR.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fbdra.23167",""

Methods: A pilot study was conducted to examine the implementation, use, and sustainability of the Diosk in 5 settings (eg, clinics, community centers, and pharmacies) serving low-income, low-literacy populations. Both quantitative and qualitative data from embedded computerized usage tracking, user surveys, and key stakeholder interviews were collected and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: There were more than 5300 uses of the Diosk in the different sites during the 11-month study. The majority of users were female, between the ages of 36 and 64 years, and Latino, and they identified themselves as having or being at risk for type 2 diabetes. Several challenges were faced in maintaining the Diosk during the study, such as organizational capacity to host wireless Internet and establishing “office champions” responsible for overseeing the Diosk. At the end of the study, 3 of the 5 sites committed to sustaining the Diosk on their own. Conclusions: This pilot study testing the feasibility and acceptability of the Diosk demonstrated that a Diosk can be implemented, used, and sustained in a population with high rates of diabetes and limited prior use of disease management programs.

HT is a naturally occurring double metal hydroxide that can be synthesized as a nanomaterial consisting of a brucite structure with isomorphous substitution of aluminum ions. These positively charged nanoparticles exhibit plate-like morphology with very high aspect ratios. Biomolecules such as nucleic acids and proteins form strong associations with HT because they can associate with the positively charged layers. The binding of nucleic acids with HT and other nanomaterials is currently being investigated for potential use in gene therapy; however, the binding of specific nucleic acid forms, such as single- and double-stranded DNA, has been little explored. In addition, the effects of charge density and particle size on DNA adsorption has not been studied. In this paper, the binding of different forms of DNA to a series of HTs prepared at different temperatures and with different anion exchange capacities has been investigated. Experiments demonstrated that HTs synthesized at higher temperatures associate with both single- and double-stranded oligomers and circular plasmid DNA more tightly than HTs synthesized at room temperature, likely due to the hydrothermal conditions promoting larger particle sizes. HT with an anion exchange capacity of 300 meq/100 g demonstrated the highest binding of DNA, likely due to the closer match of charge densities between the HT and DNA. The details of the interaction of various forms of DNA with HT as a function of charge density, particle size, and concentration are discussed.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/bip/article-pdf/doi/10.1186/1559-4106-8-8/13768657/8_1_online.pdf",""

Previous rating instruments were created using either top‐down or bottom‐up approaches. Top‐down approaches, which essentially adapt instruments originally designed for use with another species, can unfortunately lead to the inclusion of traits irrelevant to chimpanzees or fail to include all relevant aspects of chimpanzee personality. Conversely, because bottom‐up approaches derive traits specifically for chimpanzees, their unique items may impede comparisons with findings in other studies and other species. To address the limitations of each approach, we developed a new personality rating scale using a combined top‐down/bottom‐up design. Seventeen raters rated 99 chimpanzees on the new 41‐item scale, with all but one item being rated reliably. Principal components analysis, using both varimax and direct oblimin rotations, identified six broad factors. Strong evidence was found for five of the factors (Reactivity/Undependability, Dominance, Openness, Extraversion, and Agreeableness). A sixth factor (Methodical) was offered provisionally until more data are collected. We validated the factors against behavioral data collected independently on the chimpanzees. The five factors demonstrated good evidence for convergent and predictive validity, thereby underscoring the robustness of the factors. Our combined top‐down/bottom‐up approach provides the most extensive data to date to support the universal existence of these five personality factors in chimpanzees. This framework, which facilitates cross‐species comparisons, can also play a vital role in understanding the evolution of personality and can assist with husbandry and welfare efforts. Am. J.

To investigate this issue, we obtained a database cataloging every teacher who taught science in Texas public schools from 2003 to 2008, indicating the school where they taught during each of those years, the subjects they taught, and their route to certification. This allowed us to track not only teachers entering and leaving the public school system, but also migration between schools within the system.

Despite being primarily associated with thin cirrus, the corresponding regime (WS4) has heating maxima in the lower and midtroposphere due to the presence of underlying clouds. Regime-averaged Q2 profiles showed similar transitions with strong drying observed for deep convection and low-level moistening for marine boundary layer clouds. The derived profiles were generally similar over land and ocean with the notable exception of the fair-weather cumulus regime (WS8). Additional midlevel moistening was identified for several weather states over land, suggesting enhanced detrainment and more frequent congestus clouds compared to oceanic domains.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jcli/article-pdf/26/18/7097/4030575/jcli-d-12-00673_1.pdf",""

Specifically, this study examined educator beliefs related to culturally, linguistically, and economically diverse students and families along with participants’ knowledge of culture and its application in practice. Research Design: Data were collected through a qualitative instrument administered to 111 teachers and educational leaders in two school districts in Texas and Michigan. Participants provided written responses to scenarios depicting culture clashes that commonly occur in schools. Data were analyzed using a constructivist grounded theory resulting in a continuum of cultural responsiveness. Findings: Results reveal the majority of participants appear to have a general awareness of culture, but also hold a number of deficit beliefs about diverse students and their families. In describing how they apply cultural knowledge in practice, participants tended to address visible aspects of culture, overlooking less obvious aspects. The majority of participants used deficit thinking in explanations for the clashes and viewed the clashes as problems warranting a technical solution. Little consideration was given to the social aspects of schooling such as identity, culture, language, and relationships, which are at the heart of culturally responsive teaching, learning, and leading. Implications: More than 30 years of school reform efforts have failed to address inequitable educational outcomes. The results of this study suggest the ineffectiveness of reform efforts may be due in part to educators’ deficit beliefs and lack of cultural knowledge, two areas preparation and professional development programs must better address.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0013161X13488595",""

The three patterns were described as follows: (a) a methodical reading of most messages, and composing of responses occurring as the reader/writer thinks of it; (b) a coordination of reading, thinking, and writing, with careful revisiting of messages already read and deliberate crafting of responses; and (c) a complex orchestration of processes, with several reading resources consulted in addition to the conversation’s unfolding messages as well as composing processes that were interleaved with thinking and reading.

The optimal salinity and optimal solubilization ratios that correspond to ultralow IFT have recently been shown, in some cases, to be a strong function of the methane mole fraction in the oil at reservoir pressure. We incorporate a recently developed methodology to determine the optimal salinity and solubilization ratio at reservoir pressure into a chemical-flooding simulator (UTCHEM). The proposed method determines the optimal conditions on the basis of density estimates by use of a cubic equation of state (EOS) and measured phase-behavior data at atmospheric pressure. The microemulsion phase-behavior (Winsor I, II, and III) are adjusted on the basis of this predicted optimal salinity and solubilization ratio in the simulator. Parameters for the surfactant phase-behavior equation are modified to account for these changes, and the trend in the equivalent alkane carbon number (EACN) is automatically adjusted for pressure and methane content in each simulation gridblock. We use phase-behavior data from several potential SP floods to demonstrate the new implementation. The implementation of the new phase-behavior model into a chemical-flooding simulator allows for a better design of SP floods and more-accurate estimations of oil recovery. The new approach could also be used to handle free gas that may form in the reservoir; however, the SP-flood simulation when free gas is present is not the focus of this paper. We show that not accounting for the phase-behavior changes that occur when methane is present at reservoir pressure can greatly affect the oil recovery of SP floods. Improper design of an SP flood can lead to production of more oil as a microemulsion phase than as an oil bank. This paper describes the procedure to implement the effect of pressure and solution gas on microemulsion phase behavior in a chemical-flooding simulator, which requires the phase-behavior data measured at atmospheric pressure.","https://onepetro.org/SJ/article-pdf/18/03/428/3411667/spe-147473-pa.pdf",""

Method: In a 1-gate design, 167 children received comprehensive language assessments in English and Spanish during their first-grade year. The reference standard was identification by a team of expert bilingual speech-language pathologists. Receiver operating curve (ROC) analyses were used to identify the optimal prediction model for SLI. Results: The original, English EpiSLI criteria (Tomblin, Records, & Zhang, 1996) yielded a sensitivity of .95 and a specificity of .45 (LR+ = 1.73, LR− = 0.11, and AUC = .79) for our bilinguals. Revised cutoff scores yielded a sensitivity of .86 and a specificity of .68 (LR+ = 2.67, LR− = 0.21, and AUC = .77). An optimal prediction model yielded a sensitivity of .81 and a specificity of .81 (LR+ = 4.37, LR− = 0.23 and AUC = .85).

Aims: This study was designed to determine whether bilingual children with and without PLI present similar gains from kindergarten to first grade in the macro‐ and microstructure of stories told in Spanish and English. Methods & Procedures: In this longitudinal study, 21 bilingual children identified with PLI were each matched to a bilingual typically developing (TD) peer on age, sex, non‐verbal IQ and language exposure. During their kindergarten and first‐grade years, children retold stories from wordless picture books in Spanish (L1) and English (L2). Outcomes & Results: Overall, TD children outperformed those with PLI on measures of macro‐ and microstructure at both time points. For the macrostructure measure, the TD group made significantly larger improvements in both languages from kindergarten to first grade than the PLI group. For microstructure, the TD children made more gains on their Spanish retells than their English retells. However, the PLI children's microstructure scores did not differ from kindergarten to first grade in either language. We found that macrostructure scores in Spanish at kindergarten predicted macrostructure scores in English at first grade when English experience was held constant. However, this same relationship across languages was not evident in microstructure. Conclusions & Implications: TD and PLI children differed in the development of narrative macro‐ and microstructure between kindergarten and first grade. The TD bilinguals transferred conceptually dependent narrative skills easily, but then had to learn independently the nuances of each language to be successful using literate language. Because most children with PLI need more exposure to establish strong connections between their L1 and L2, they had more difficulty transferring their knowledge of literate language forms from one language to another.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2F1460-6984.12044",""

Instead parents are influenced by their social networks, broadly defined as the people and sources they go to for information, direction, and advice. This study used social network analysis to formally examine parents’ social networks (people networks and source networks) related to their vaccination decision-making. In addition to providing descriptions of typical networks of parents who conform to the recommended vaccination schedule (conformers) and those who do not (nonconformers), this study also quantified the effect of network variables on parents’ vaccination choices. METHODS:: This study took place in King County, Washington. Participation was limited to US-born, first-time parents with children aged ≤18 months. Data were collected via an online survey. Logistic regression was used to analyze the resulting data. RESULTS:: One hundred twenty-six conformers and 70 nonconformers completed the survey. Although people networks were reported by 95% of parents in both groups, nonconformers were significantly more likely to report source networks (100% vs 80%, P &lt; .001). Model comparisons of parent, people, and source network characteristics indicated that people network variables were better predictors of parents’ vaccination choices than parents’ own characteristics or the characteristics of their source networks. In fact, the variable most predictive of parents’ vaccination decisions was the percent of parents’ people networks recommending nonconformity. CONCLUSIONS:: These results strongly suggest that social networks, and particularly parents’ people networks, play an important role in parents’ vaccination decision-making.","https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-pdf/131/5/e1397/1090445/peds_2012-2452.pdf",""

Results: We find that the parental education level of adolescents is not as predictive for many minority children of immigrants compared to white children of native‐born parents for registration. Additionally, the academic rigor of the courses taken in high school has a greater positive estimated effect on the likelihood of registration and party identification for Latino children of immigrants compared to white third‐plus‐generation young adults.

Our primary objective was to compare the relative influence of geography, land cover and host species on the local abundance of cowbirds.

Cowbird abundance increased with host species richness but did not change in any significant way with non‐host passerine richness or abundance of host species.

We use a mixed-methods approach to explore the importance of gender in shaping processes around depression within marriage. We approach this in two ways: First, using quantitative longitudinal analysis of 2,601 couples from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), we address whether depressive symptoms in one spouse shape the other spouse’s depressive symptoms and whether men or women are more influential in this process. We find that a wife’s depressive symptoms influence her husband’s future depressive symptoms, but a husband’s depressive symptoms do not influence his wife’s future symptoms. Second, we conduct a qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews with 29 couples wherein one or both spouses experienced depression to provide additional insight into how gender impacts depression and reactions to depression within marriage.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) was injected into coarse-grained fluvial deposits of the Cretaceous lower Tuscaloosa formation, forming a gentle anticline at depths of 3300 m. CO2 injection started in July 2008, increasing to 23 wells (as of May 2011), with total injection rates greater than 1 million tons/yr. Focused monitoring programs of the deep subsurface and near surface have been implemented in different study areas. Here we present results of the near-surface monitoring program over a 3-year period, including shallow groundwater monitoring and soil-gas monitoring. A general methodology of detecting CO2 leakage into shallow groundwater chemistry is proposed. A set of geochemical indicator parameters was identified on the basis of the characterization of groundwater geochemistry, and these were further tested and validated using numerical modeling approaches, laboratory experiments, and field experiments. For soil-gas monitoring, a site (P-site) containing a plugged and abandoned well, a nearby open pit, and an engineered pad (representing a typical industrial near-surface environment for soil-gas monitoring) was selected for detailed study. The site was heavily instrumented with various sensors for measuring soil-gas concentrations at different depths, soil-water content, matric potential, and weather information. Three monitoring technologies were assessed: soil CO2 concentration measurements, CO2 flux measurements on the land surface, and multiple soil-gas component measurements. Results indicate that soil-gas-component measurements provide reliable information for gas-leakage detection. Methodologies of near-surface monitoring developed in this study can be used to improve CO2-leakage monitoring at other CO2 sequestration projects. This early field project was funded by the US Department of Energy, National Energy Technology Laboratory, as part of the Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships (RCSP) program. SECARB is led by the Southern States Energy Board (SSEB).","http://onepetro.org/SJ/article-pdf/18/03/486/2127372/spe-163075-pa.pdf",""

The formation of an aqueous phase in contact with hydrocarbon phases is inevitable in almost all recovery processes, because of the permanent presence of water in the reservoirs either as injection fluid or as initial formation water. As the number of phases increases, flash calculations become more difficult and time-consuming. A possible approach to reduce the computational time of the phase-equilibrium calculations is to use reduced methods. This paper presents a general strategy to model the phase behavior of CO2/ hydrocarbon/water systems in which four equilibrium phases occur by use of a reduced-flash approach. The speedup obtained by a reduced-flash algorithm compared with the conventional-flash approach is demonstrated for a different number of components and phases. The results show a significant speedup in the Jacobian-matrix construction and in Newton-Raphson (NR) iterations by use of the reduced method when four phases are present. The computational advantage of the reduced method increases rapidly with the number of phases and components. The developed four-phase reduced-flash algorithm is used to investigate the effect of introducing water on the phase behavior of two west Texas oil/CO2 mixtures. The results show changes in the phase splits and saturation pressures by adding water to these CO2/hydrocarbon systems.","http://onepetro.org/SJ/article-pdf/18/05/943/2098861/spe-154218-pa.pdf",""

We implemented compositional-space adaptive tabulation (CSAT), the most promising tie-simplex-based method, in UTCOMP, the University of Texas' in-house IMPEC compositional reservoir simulator, to investigate its computational efficiency compared with the phase-behavior algorithm in UTCOMP. The results show that applying CSAT only to skip stability analysis does improve computational time, but only when a significant portion of the gridblocks are in the single-phase region and no other technique for avoiding stability analysis is used. However, in most cases, there is little or no computational advantage to use of CSAT when the simple option in UTCOMP is used where stability analysis is skipped for blocks surrounded by single-phase regions. We explore in detail the performance of CSAT, which depends significantly on the specific gas flood modeled, and the number of tie-lines generated during adaptive tabulation. The results shed light on applicability of CSAT in the IMPEC-type compositional reservoir simulators and show that the advantages of CSAT in this type of simulator are not as great as are reported in the literature for fully implicit or adaptive implicit formulations.","http://onepetro.org/SJ/article-pdf/19/02/327/2100222/spe-163676-pa.pdf",""

Findings revealed that consumption of maternity dress during pregnancy both complicated and supported participants’ embodied experiences as liminal, pregnant selves and their transition to motherhood. Three overarching themes were identified and reflect the ways in which participants’ consumption practices were tightly bound with their identities, which, in turn, represented a repertoire of possible selves that often diverged from the participants’ current identities. Specifically, the three emergent themes included: (1) maternity dress consumption representing disruption in the ‘Woman I Am Most of the Time,’ (2) maternity dress consumption to affirm one’s new identity as ‘Pregnant/Expectant Mother,’ and (3) maternity dress consumption to maintain continuity in the ‘Woman I Am Most of the Time.’ Findings also underscored that consumption during liminality is complex, both inciting and relieving ambivalence during role transition.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1469540513480161",""

Experiments show a direct correlation between apparent activation energy and flame speed suggesting that flame speed is directly influenced by chemical kinetics. Toward this end, the first principle simulations resolve key exothermic surface and intermediate chemistries contributing toward the kinetics that promote high flame speeds. Linking molecular level exothermicity to macroscopic experimental investigations provides insight into the unique role of the alumina oxide shell passivating aluminum particles. In the case of Al reacting with I2O5, the alumina shell promotes exothermic surface chemistries that reduce activation energy and increase flame speed. This finding is in contrast to Al reaction with metal oxides that show the alumina shell does not participate exothermically in the reaction.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.4818167/15464916/074701_1_online.pdf",""

The solubility predictions are then, quite different than those without reactions. Accurate solubility estimates in the presence of such reactions are integral towards developing an effective acid gas disposal strategy for continuous production from these fields. Also, the modeling of CO2 injection in oil reservoirs entails complex interplay of flow, geochemical reactions and hydrocarbon phase behavior. The geochemical reactions affect the component mole numbers, which can change the number of hydrocarbon phases and/or affect the distribution of components in them. In this research, we propose the Gibbs free energy minimization algorithm that integrates geochemical reactions and phase behavior to find equilibrium compositions for these two applications. We use this algorithm to find equilibrium compositions for not just pure phase equilibrium (without reactions) but also phase and chemical equilibrium (with reactions). While the number and composition of the hydrocarbon phases may vary; we assume all the geochemical reactions are at equilibrium. In the first application, we use this algorithm to estimate solubility of acid gases (CO2 and/or H2S) in pure water as well as CO2 solubility in high salinity brine. The algorithm predicts the solubility for binary systems of CO2- H2O and H2S-H2O at high pressures and at temperatures upto 50°C. The use of Pitzer's activity coefficient model for aqueous phase components also helps predict the solubility of CO2 in high salinity brine. In the second application for hydrocarbons, we investigate the impact of geochemical reactions on the phase distribution of CH4-CO2-H2O mixture. We observe that the geochemical reactions do not change the equilibrium phase mole fractions at 50°C in the pressure range 0.1–20 MPa.","http://onepetro.org/SPEATCE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/166448-MS/1535738/spe-166448-ms.pdf",""

Here, we derived a family of goal functions that explicitly defined infinite possible redundancies between distance ( D) and time ( T) for unidirectional reaching. All [ T, D] combinations satisfying any specific goal function defined a goal-equivalent manifold (GEM). We tested how humans learned two such functions, D/T = c (constant speed) and D·T = c, that were very different but could both be achieved by neurophysiologically and biomechanically similar reaching movements. Subjects were never explicitly shown either relationship, but only instructed to minimize their errors. Subjects exhibited significant learning and consolidation of learning for both tasks. Initial error magnitudes were higher, but learning rates were faster, for the D· T task than for the D/ T task. Learning the D/ T task first facilitated subsequent learning of the D· T task. Conversely, learning the D· T task first interfered with subsequent learning of the D/ T task. Analyses of trial-to-trial dynamics demonstrated that subjects actively corrected deviations perpendicular to each GEM faster than deviations along each GEM to the same degree for both tasks, despite exhibiting significantly greater variance ratios for the D/ T task. Variance measures alone failed to capture critical features of trial-to-trial control. Humans actively exploited these abstract task redundancies, even though they did not have to.

The focus of this assessment is to analyze the long-lasting and broad application of his 1881 work, The Formation of Vegetable Mould, Through the Action of Worms, with Observations on their Habits. In particular, this assessment identifies and elaborates on underlying lessons for today’s geomorphologists. The underlying lessons presented here are three-fold: (1) be multidisciplinary, (2) assess the trivial, and (3) be impactful. First, we review the context of geomorphology in his essay on worms. Then, we address each of the three underlying lessons. We discuss how geomorphologists have adopted these lessons, and what geomorphology can continue to learn from Darwin (1881). In doing so, we analyze the wide influence Darwin’s Worms has had on the scientific community, with an emphasis on geomorphic implications. Our analysis shows that over 900 publications refer to Darwin (1881). In addition, these publications were derived from a variety of disciplines including, but not limited to, anthropology, biogeography, botany, geology, paleontology, philosophy, psychology, scientific travel writing, taxonomy, and zoology. At first glance, it may appear trivial to assess the amount of earth moved by worms, yet this is how Darwin spent his final years. His efforts were not in vain, but rather found that worms play an essential role in soil health, and his work continues to gain recognition and inspire geomorphologists.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0309133313481789",""

The most reliable methods to calculate the MMP are based on slim-tube experiments, 1-D slim-tube simulations, mixing cell calculations, and the analytical methods known as the method of characteristics (MOC). The calculation of MMP using MOC is the fastest method because it relies solely on finding the key tie lines in the displacement path. The MOC method for MMP estimation in its current form assumes that the composition path is a series of shocks from one key tie line to the next. For some oils, however, these key tie lines do not control miscibility and the MMP calculated using the key tie line approach can be significantly in error. The error can be as high as 5,000 psia for heavier oils or CO2 displacements at low temperature where three-phase hydrocarbon regions can exist (L1-L2-V). At higher pressures, the two- or three-phase region can split (or bifurcate) into two separate two-phase regions (L1-L2 and L1-V regions). Thus, for the MMP calculation from MOC to be correct we must calculate the entire composition path for this complex phase behavior, instead of relying on the shock assumption from one key tie line to the next.","http://onepetro.org/SPEATCE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/166487-MS/1537015/spe-166487-ms.pdf",""

One of the main challenges is to model flow to a horizontal well from a complex network of hydraulic and natural fractures. Many unconventional reservoirs comprise well-developed natural fracture networks with multiple orientations and complex hydraulic fracture patterns based on microseismic data. Conventional dual porosity and dual permeability models are not adequate for modeling these complex networks of natural and hydraulic fractures. Also, it is neither practical nor advantageous to model a large number of pre-existing fractures with a discrete fracture model. Therefore, an appropriate approach to model production from low-permeability reservoirs is to perform discrete fracture modeling for hydraulic fractures and employ a dual continuum approach for numerous natural fractures.","http://onepetro.org/spersc/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/163647-MS/1562126/spe-163647-ms.pdf",""

In this paper, we show in what extent thermal stresses induced by temperature difference between fracturing fluid and formation fluid could provide the driving force to open a portion of these small cemented natural fractures laying on the surface of hydraulic fractures. Moreover, through combination of stress analysis and empirical fracture distribution models obtained from outcrops, we calculate the increase of total reservoir/fractures contact surface under the condition of microfractures activation. Our thermoelasticity analysis reveals the effect of the pump rate and temperature of the fracturing fluid on the number of activated microfractures. The results show that the volume of the micro-fractures varies depending on the length of the microfracture, rock properties and time. At the end, through an example, we show that activation of only a small portion of these microfractures can increase the total formation contact surface considerably and consequently initial production. Reservoir pressure changes due to production might partially close or re -open these micro-cracks during production. Hence, the role of these microfractures is mainly restricted to the early life of the reservoirs.","http://onepetro.org/SPEHFTC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/163872-MS/1574348/spe-163872-ms.pdf",""

We examine how passenger profiling impacts airport security operations when the profiler is vulnerable to gaming by attackers. We consider the no-profiling setup and two profiling setups. In the no-profiling setup, all passengers are sent through a screening device, and those that raise an alarm are physically inspected. In the first profiling setup, all classified attackers are physically inspected and classified normal passengers are sent through a screening device, and those that raise an alarm are physically inspected. In the second profiling setup, every passenger, regardless of the profiler's classification, is sent through a screening device and those that raise an alarm are inspected, but the screening devices are configured differently for classified attackers and classified normal passengers. We find that, regardless of the profiling setup, the optimal profiling setup performs at least as good as the no-profiling setup on key performance measures such as total expected security cost, inspection rate of normal passengers, and attacker detection rate even when the profiler is vulnerable to attackers' gaming. The benefit from profiling increases if the profiler becomes less vulnerable.

Understanding ATs' beliefs toward the recommended concussion practice guidelines is the first step in identifying interventions that could increase compliance. The theory of planned behavior (TPB) allows us to measure ATs' beliefs toward the recommended concussion practice guidelines. Objective:: To examine the influence of ATs' beliefs toward the current recommended concussion guidelines on concussion-management practice through an application of the TPB. Design:: Cross-sectional study. Setting:: A Web link with a survey was e-mailed to 1000 randomly selected members of the National Athletic Trainers' Association (NATA). Patients or Other Participants:: A total of 221 certified ATs working in secondary school/clinic, high school, and college/university settings. Main Outcome Measure(s):: A 66-item survey reflecting the current recommended concussion guidelines of the NATA and International Conference on Concussion in Sport was created to measure beliefs using the TPB constructs attitude toward the behavior (BA), subjective norms (SN), perceived behavioral control (PBC), and behavioral intention (BI) of ATs. We used a linear multiple regression to determine if the TPB constructs BA, SN, and PBC predicted BI and if PBC and BI predicted behavior according to the TPB model. Results:: We found that BA, SN, and PBC predicted BI (R = 0.683, R2 = 0.466, F3,202 = 58.78, P &lt; .001). The BA (t202 = 5.53, P &lt; .001) and PBC (t202 = 9.64, P &lt; .001) contributed to the model, whereas SN (t202 = −0.84, P = .402) did not. The PBC and BI predicted behavior (R = 0.661, R2 = 0.437, F2,203 = 78.902, P &lt; .001). Conclusions:: In this sample, the TPB constructs predicted BI and behavior of ATs' compliance with recommended concussion-management guidelines. The BA and PBC were the most influential constructs, indicating that those with positive attitudes toward concussion-management recommendations are more likely to implement them, and ATs are less likely to implement them when they do not believe they have the power to do so. We theorize that interventions targeting ATs' attitudes and control perceptions will lead to improved compliance.","http://meridian.allenpress.com/jat/article-pdf/48/5/636/1609327/1062-6050-48_3_10.pdf",""

The investigators test the proposed methodology by its application to distributions in pitch interval of the peak word-pitch (collectively called the discourse gamut) that occur in simulated and actual spontaneous emotive narratives obtained from 17 middle-aged African-American adults. The analysis, in rigorous tests, not only faithfully reproduced simulated distributions imbedded in realistic time series that drift and include pitch breaks, but the protocol also reveals that the empirical distributions exhibit a common hidden structure when normalized to a slowly varying mode (called the gamut root) of their respective probability density functions.

Three-dimensional gravity models obtained by inverting residual gravity anomalies and 2D resistivity models obtained by inverting the transverse electric and transverse magnetic magnetotelluric modes show several common features. Our models show that a low-resistivity zone above a higher resistivity zone correlates with a low-density region located 1–4 km beneath the volcano. These zones may be related to a high temperature gradient or hydrothermally altered, fractured rocks. Additionally, a low-resistivity ([Formula: see text]) and a low-density region located approximately 4–6 km below the volcano may be related to molten material that is the source of heat for the geothermal system. The low-resistivity ([Formula: see text]) regions that correlated with a denser ([Formula: see text]) region within the caldera are bounded by high-resistivity ([Formula: see text]), high-density ([Formula: see text]) volcanic units implying that the dense and electrically resistive volcanic material is relatively cool and lacks significant fluid content that can lower resistivity. At shallow depths, 0.5–1.5 km below the caldera, a low-resistivity and low-to-moderate density region is interpreted as a zone with high fracture density that consists of clay minerals resulting from hydrothermal alteration. These results agree well with the results from previous seismic studies on the depth of the suggested molten rocks.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/geo2011-0419.1",""

Methods: A modified version of the Standardized Nordic Questionnaire was administered to assess MSS prevalence among 452 US large‐herd parlor workers. Worker demographics and MSS prevalences were assessed, and differences based on parlor configuration (i.e., herringbone, parallel, rotary) were computed. Results: Three‐fourths (76.4%) of parlor workers reported work‐related MSS in at least one body part. Highest prevalences were reported in the upper extremity (55%). Herringbone workers reported a higher prevalence of MSS in the wrist/hand, and rotary workers reported higher prevalences of MSS in the neck, upper back, and shoulders. Conclusions: Our findings draw attention to higher work‐related MSS in the upper extremity among dairy parlor workers. As the trend toward larger herd sizes on US dairy farms continues, the need for further health and safety research will increase. Am. J. Ind.

Two Se sources were used: an effusion cell loaded with 5N source material that produced a predominantly Se6 beam and a cracker loaded with 6N material that could produce a predominantly Se2 beam. The background electron concentration in as-grown samples was significantly reduced by switching to the Se cracker source, going from 1017–1018 cm−3 to 3–5 × 1016 cm−3 at 12 K. The concentration remained low even when the cracking zone temperature was lowered to produce a predominantly Se6 beam, which strongly suggests that a major source of donor defects is impurities from the Se source material rather than Se species. Secondary ion mass spectroscopy was performed. Likely donors such as F, Br, and Cl were detected at the ZnTe interface while C, O, and Si were found at the interface and in the top 1.5 μm from the surface in all samples measured. The electron concentration for all samples increased when annealed in a Cd or Hg overpressure and decreased when annealed under Se. This suggests the presence of native defects such as vacancies and interstitials in addition to impurities. Overall, by switching to higher purity Se material and then annealing under Se overpressures, the background electron concentration was reduced by an order of magnitude, with the lowest value achieved being 9.4 × 1015 cm−3 at 12 K.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-pdf/doi/10.1116/1.4798651/15918782/03c124_1_online.pdf",""

As a result of Study 1, an exploratory measure was developed and validated for perceived risk that was specifically associated with the consumption of environmentally sustainable apparel. This also took into account the multidimensional nature of perceived risk. As a result of Study 2, a structural model was developed and tested, illustrating the effects that each dimension of perceived risk had on attitudes and behavioral intentions. These studies resulted in the identification of four primary risks, including financial, performance, psychological, and social risks, that keep young consumers from deciding to purchase environmentally sustainable apparel. The results demonstrated that the significance and effect size of the perceived risks were different for the four dimensions. Also, the results indicated that attitudes can act as a mediator between perceived risks and behavioral intentions. These results should help practitioners to become more effective in persuading young consumers to make better choices to minimize the environmental impact of their apparel consumption. The results could also be used to encourage the cultivation and development of apparel products that are sustainable.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Ffcsr.12013",""

Large-scale credit aggregation can only be achieved by the use of modern banks. However, rural consumers may resist the use of banks as objects of nonlocal origin. The authors rely on the classic theory of demand aggregation advantage to critically analyze the public policy framework underpinning rural banking for the attainment of inclusive economic development goals of bottom-of-the-pyramid countries. An empirical test of the framework in Ghana's rural banking programs shows that demand aggregation advantage predicts consumer satisfaction with the inclusive lending practices of banking institutions among existing clients but not new clients. The study suggests that the public policy framework for promoting compliance with inclusive lending goals of rural banking programs in Ghana does not adequately consider rural consumers’ interpretation of demand aggregation activities.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1509/jppm.12.052",""

Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate a clear racial/ethnic hierarchy as well as group-level variations in opportunity relative to industrial concentration, segregation, and discrimination. Assimilative attributes and generational status mattered, yet certain inequalities were more firmly entrenched. Most pronounced, as seen in our qualitative analyses, were processes of social closure, discrimination, and related exclusionary constraints—constraints encountered and eventually alleviated, to some degree, for new white ethnics but not for African Americans. We conclude by discussing the theoretical and empirical utility of considering the embedded nature of assimilation within broader contexts of racial/ethnic closure in labor market opportunities and also relative to historical and contemporary eras.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0003122413501071",""

Respondents were presented with a series of paired hypothetical fishing trip scenarios for catfish and were asked to choose the trips that they most preferred. Trip scenarios varied by the relative number of catfish that were caught and harvested, relative size of catfish that were caught, water body type, level of site development, and distance traveled (i.e., representing travel costs). A conditional logit model was fitted to analyze angler preferences by determining the influence of trip attributes on angler choice. Model results indicated that anglers’ choice of fishing trips was most influenced by distance traveled, followed by the catch‐related aspects of the trip, with catfish size having a greater influence than the numbers of catfish caught or harvested. We then conducted a latent class analysis of catfish anglers, which involved the use of cluster analysis to assign anglers to five groups based on their catch‐related attitude scores, and we reran the stated choice model for each cluster. Clusters ranged from harvest‐oriented anglers to size‐oriented anglers that were focused on catching large trophy fish. Results from these models can assist fisheries managers in setting management goals and objectives that best meet the needs of their clientele.","https://afspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02755947.2013.822443",""

Thus, it has been assumed that they often experience intense stress. A markedly different possibility, however, is suggested by Attraction-Selection-Attrition (ASA) theory. This perspective suggests that persons who are attracted by, selected into, and persist in entrepreneurship may be relatively high in the capacity to tolerate or effectively manage stress. In contrast, persons who are relatively low in this capacity tend to exit from entrepreneurship either voluntarily or involuntarily. As a result, founding entrepreneurs as a group are predicted to experience low rather than high levels of stress while running new ventures. Results supported this reasoning: Founding entrepreneurs reported lower levels of stress when compared to participants in a large national survey of perceived stress. Additional findings indicate that entrepreneurs’ relatively low levels of stress derive, at least in part, from high levels of psychological capital (a combination of self-efficacy, optimism, hope, and resilience). Psychological capital was negatively related to stress, and stress, in turn, was negatively related to entrepreneurs’ subjective well-being. Furthermore, and also consistent with ASA theory, the stress-reducing effects of psychological capital were stronger for older than younger entrepreneurs.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0149206313495411",""

To do so, a sample of twin pairs from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) was analyzed using quantitative genetic analyses. The analyses revealed three key findings. First, genetic factors account for about 50% of the variance in measures of social support. Second, the covariance between social support and self-control is largely due to a common genetic pathway. Third, even after holding genetic influences constant, social support has a significant effect on levels of self-control.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0093854813504918",""

We grow Al-doped SrTiO3 films directly on Si(100) and show from electron energy loss spectra that the bandgap is increased by approximately 0.3 eV over undoped SrTiO3. This bandgap increase is confirmed by spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements on identical films grown on LaAlO3 substrates, which show a 0.3 eV blue shift in the steep increase of the absorption edge. Current vs. voltage measurements show a reduction in leakage current by six orders of magnitude at a field of 1 MV/cm. We use density functional theory to explain how Al replacing Ti modifies the conduction band edge density of states resulting in the experimentally observed increase in the bandgap.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.4824023/13194322/142906_1_online.pdf",""

These herbicides were applied either alone or in combination. Smellmelon control was greater than 90% with all 7 DAC treatments while preemergence (PRE) treatments of flumioxazin plus paraquat controlled 87 to 97% in one of two years. No peanut injury was noted following either herbicide applied preemergence; however, early-season injury (stunting and leaf chlorosis/necrosis) was evident with flumioxazin and paraquat alone or in combination when applied 7 DAC. Early-season injury in south Texas from the 7 DAC applications of flumioxazin and paraquat varied from 9 to 63% with flumioxazin alone, 18 to 65% with paraquat alone, and 33 to 83% with combinations of the two herbicides. Injury in the Texas High Plains was never more than 40% with either herbicide alone or in combination. Mid-season injury in south Texas was at least 13% with any combination that included flumioxazin at 0.11 kg/ha while injury in the Texas High Plains varied from 12 to 25%.

As a result, the scope of supply chain related operations have increasingly cut across organizational boundaries. To understand and capture such cross‐organizational activities, researchers have broadened the focus of their studies and included multiple stakeholders in their analysis (e.g., integration, sustainability, and buyer‐supplier relationships). However, multi‐stakeholder research has also increased the complexity and effort required to conduct studies across organizational boundaries. Unfortunately, many studies that use multi‐stakeholder constructs fail to fully address their multi‐sided nature during both construct conceptualization and data collection. Several studies suggest that neglecting the multi‐sided nature of certain constructs can affect the research validity and reliability and may invalidate research inferences and results, although such concerns have not been empirically demonstrated. The current study addresses this gap by performing a series of tests using data from 105 matched pairs of buyers and their suppliers to illustrate key methodological considerations for conducting multi‐stakeholder research. This study also offers practical guidance regarding assumptions routinely made in single rater research and proposes when single rater data may be appropriate for multi‐stakeholder research.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2012.01371.x",""

The development of more reliable PD assessments and the implementation of four major longitudinal studies on PD stability have provided critical data with which to evaluate the stability of PD features. Results from these and other studies reveal significant complexity in the interpretation of PD stability because of several issues that can impact stability estimates. Such estimates will vary as a function of the type of constructs being assessed, the type of stability being considered, the modality and reliability of the assessments being used, and the impacts of sampling. In this article, longitudinal research on PD stability is reviewed in the context of these issues. It is concluded that no single answer can be given to the question, “How stable are PDs?” and that future research and classification need to consider carefully and account for the complexity of this question.","https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-050212-185637",""

Little is known about racial/ethnic differences in timing of death during childhood. Our intent was to investigate racial/ethnic differences in mortality for CHDs during specific time periods in childhood. METHODS: Texas Birth Defect Registry data were used for a retrospective cohort study with 30,015 singleton infants with a CHD, born January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2007, to non‐Hispanic (NH) white, NH‐black, or Hispanic women. Texas Birth Defect Registry data were linked to Texas death records to ascertain death. Kaplan–Meier survival probabilities and multivariable Cox‐proportional hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: NH‐blacks and Hispanics with specific CHDs had increased mortality during the postneonatal period and early childhood. NH‐blacks had increased postneonatal mortality compared with NH‐whites for transposition of the great arteries (HR = 2.4; 95% CI, 1.5–4.0), pulmonary valve atresia without ventricular septal defect (HR = 4.1; 95% CI, 1.7–9.7), Ebstein's anomaly (HR = 8.6; 95 CI, 1.2–61.1), hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HR = 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2–3.7), coarctation of the aorta (HR = 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2–3.5), ventricular septal defect (HR = 2.1; 95% CI, 1.6−2.8), and atrial septal defect (HR = 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1−1.8). Hispanics had increased postneonatal mortality risk for tetralogy of Fallot (HR = 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1–3.5). Racial/ethnic increases in mortality risk were also observed during infancy and childhood. CONCLUSION: Racial/ethnic differences in mortality were most notably observed during the postneonatal period and early childhood.

We consider a firm’s costs and benefits of local and nonlocal rival isomorphism and assert that a firm can signal its quality, which affects financial performance of the equity offering.

This study looks at a circumstance in which quasi-stationary convection forms perpendicular to, and above the cold-pool behind strong bow echoes. The authors refer to this phenomenon as a “bow and arrow” because on radar imagery the two convective lines resemble an archer’s bow and arrow. The “arrow” can produce heavy rainfall and severe weather, extending over hundreds of kilometers. These events are challenging to forecast because they require an accurate forecast of earlier convection and the effects of that convection on the environment. In this study, basic characteristics of 14 events are documented, and observations of 4 events are presented to identify common environmental conditions prior to the development of the back-building convection. Simulations of three cases using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) are analyzed in an attempt to understand the mechanisms responsible for initiating and maintaining the convective line. In each case, strong southwesterly flow (inducing warm air advection and gradual isentropic lifting), in addition to directional and speed convergence into the convective arrow appear to contribute to initiation of convection. The linear orientation of the arrow may be associated with a combination of increased wind speeds and horizontal shear in the arrow region. When these ingredients are combined with thermodynamic instability, there appears to be a greater possibility of formation and maintenance of a convective arrow behind a bow echo.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/mwr/article-pdf/141/5/1648/4288926/mwr-d-12-00172_1.pdf",""

METHODS: A literature survey was performed by electronic database search. The survey covered the period from January 1966 to December 2008 and used Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). Articles were initially selected based on their titles and abstracts; the full articles were then retrieved. The inclusion criteria included growing subjects between 8 to 15 years of age, Class II malocclusion treatment with high-pull headgear, and a control group with Class II malocclusion. References from selected articles were hand-searched for additional publications. Selected studies were evaluated methodologically. RESULTS: Four articles were selected; none were randomized controlled trials. All of the articles clearly formulated their objectives and used appropriate measures. The studies showed that high-pull headgear treatment improves skeletal and dental relationship, distal displacement of the maxilla, vertical eruption control and upper molars distalization. One of the studies showed a slight clockwise rotation of the palatal plane; the others showed no significant treatment effect. The mandible was not affected by the treatment. CONCLUSION: While there is still a lack of strong evidence demonstrating the effects of high-pull headgear with a splint, other studies indicate that the AP relations improve due to distalization of the maxilla and upper molars, with little or no treatment effects in the mandible.

These fracturing treatments are often mapped by use of hypocenters of induced microseismic events. In some cases, the microseismic mapping shows asymmetry of the induced-fracture geometry with respect to the injection well. In addition, the conventional theories predict fracture propagation along a path normal to the least compressive in-situ stresses, whereas in some cases the microseismic data suggest fracture propagation parallel to the minimum compressive stress. In this paper, we present an extended-finite-element-method (XFEM) model that can simulate asymmetric fracture-wing development as well as diversion of the fracture path along natural fractures. Simulation results demonstrate the sensitivity of the fracture-pattern geometry to differential stress and natural-fracture orientation with respect to the in-situ maximum compressive stress. We examine the properties of sealed natural fractures that are common in formations such as the Barnett shale and show that they may still serve as weak paths for hydraulic-fracture beginning and/or diversion. The presented model predicts faster fracture propagation in formations where natural fractures are favorably aligned with the tectonic stresses.","http://onepetro.org/SJ/article-pdf/19/01/161/2101457/spe-167608-pa.pdf",""

This catchment is developed entirely on the Fe‐rich, Silurian Rose Hill gray shale. Hillslopes exhibit a topographic asymmetry: The north‐facing hillslope has an average slope gradient of ~20°, slightly steeper than the south‐facing hillslope (~15°). The regolith samples display significant U‐series disequilibrium resulting from shale weathering. Based on the U‐series data, the rates of regolith production on the two ridgetops are indistinguishable (40 ± 22 versus 45 ± 12 m/Ma). However, when downslope positions are compared, the regolith profiles on the south‐facing hillslope are characterized by faster regolith production rates (50 ± 15 to 52 ± 15 m/Ma) and shorter durations of chemical weathering (12 ± 3 to 16 ± 5 ka) than those on the north‐facing hillslope (17 ± 14 to 18 ± 13 m/Ma and 39 ± 20 to 43 ± 20 ka). The south‐facing hillslope is also characterized by faster chemical weathering rates inferred from major element chemistry, despite lower extents of chemical depletion. These results are consistent with the influence of aspect on regolith formation at Shale Hills; we hypothesize that aspect affects such variables as temperature, moisture content, and evapotranspiration in the regolith zone, causing faster chemical weathering and regolith formation rates on the south‐facing side of the catchment. The difference in microclimate between these two hillslopes is inferred to have been especially significant during the periglacial period that occurred at Shale Hills at least ~15 ka before present. At that time, the erosion rates may also have been different from those observed today, perhaps denuding the south‐facing hillslope of regolith but not quite stripping the north‐facing hillslope. An analysis of hillslope evolution and response timescales with a linear mass transport model shows that the current landscape at Shale Hills is not in geomorphologic steady state (i.e., so‐called dynamic equilibrium) but rather is likely still responding to the climate shift from the Holocene periglacial to the modern, temperate conditions.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fjgrf.20037",""

Similarly, natural Ad36 infection is cross-sectionally associated with greater adiposity and better glycemic control in humans. This study compared longitudinal observations in indices of adiposity (BMI and body fat percentage) and glycemic control (fasting glucose and insulin) in Ad36-infected versus uninfected adults. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Baseline sera from Hispanic men and women (n = 1,400) were screened post hoc for the presence of Ad36-specific antibodies. Indices of adiposity and glycemic control at baseline and at ∼10 years past the baseline were compared between seropositive and seronegative subjects, with adjustment for age and sex. In addition to age and sex, indices of glycemic control were adjusted for baseline BMI and were analyzed only for nondiabetic subjects. RESULTS: Seropositive subjects (14.5%) had greater adiposity at baseline, compared with seronegative subjects. Longitudinally, seropositive subjects showed greater adiposity indices but lower fasting insulin levels. Subgroup analyses revealed that Ad36-seropositivity was associated with better baseline glycemic control and lower fasting insulin levels over time in the normal-weight group (BMI ≤25 kg/m2) and longitudinally, with greater adiposity in the overweight (BMI 25–30 kg/m2) and obese (BMI &gt;30 kg/m2) men. Statistically, the differences between seropositive and seronegative individuals were modest in light of the multiple tests performed. CONCLUSIONS: This study strengthens the plausibility that in humans, Ad36 increases adiposity and attenuates deterioration of glycemic control. Panoptically, the study raises the possibility that certain infections may modulate obesity or diabetes risk. A comprehensive understanding of these under-recognized factors is needed to effectively combat such metabolic disorders.","https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/36/3/701/613940/701.pdf",""

Revisiting the alliance–conflict relationship, we allow the type of issue at stake to vary in order to determine whether this deterrent effect holds even when the most salient of issues are under contention. Specifically, we introduce indicators for whether the two states are competing over territorial issues, a high-salience stake that is particularly conflict-prone. Using a number of different indicators for territorial competition and examining several different time periods, analyses suggest that targeted defensive alliances do indeed have a deterrent effect against named adversaries, even when the most salient of issues are at stake.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0738894213503440",""

We consider whether two characteristics that are particularly relevant to the audit environment, prior organizational response and power distance, affect willingness to report. Data collected from 106 senior-level auditors suggest auditors are more likely to report on their peers than on their superiors, but they are more likely to report superiors when prior organizational response is strong than when it is weak. Additionally, men appear to be relatively less sensitive to variations in power distance or prior organization response than women. Moral intensity of the case is significantly related to reporting likelihood, and power distance moderates this effect such that those who perceive this scenario to be of lower moral intensity are much more influenced by power distance than are those who perceive it to be of high moral intensity. These results contribute to the existing literature on accounting ethics, as well as inform public accounting governance policies.","https://publications.aaahq.org/bria/article-pdf/25/2/21/54294/bria-50415.pdf",""

Less attention has been given to the problem of how new organizations attract collective attention. Although related to legitimation, the problem of attracting attention is distinct, as attention and evaluation are distinct cognitive processes. In this study, we examine the allocation of collective attention to new organizations in a system of relationships, within which new organizations seek to attract attention through their sensegiving activities; the information properties of their sensegiving activities affect the level of attention they receive from different types of media; and media attention, in turn, increases their perceived value potential in the eyes of venture capital investors (VCs). We examine these relationships in a sample of 398 information-technology start-ups that have obtained different levels of venture capital funding. Our results show that new organizations that engage in more intense and diverse sensegiving activities attract higher levels of industry media attention and that these effects are enhanced by the human capital of their founders and leaders. Diverse sensegiving activities are also associated with higher levels of attention from the general media, but only the attention of specialized industry media is positively associated with the level of VC funding obtained. These findings extend current research on information intermediation and institutional legitimation by demonstrating that media attention early in the life of new organizations affects how they are valued by a well-informed expert audience, such as VCs. They also contribute to entrepreneurship research on the effects of new organizations’ strategies on their ability to secure resources and to research on VC funding decisions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/orsc.1120.0759",""

Using a within-CEO empirical design, we find that retiring CEOs are more likely to issue forecasts of future earnings, and that they issue such forecasts more frequently in their terminal year relative to other years during their tenure with the firm. Further, retiring CEOs' terminal-year forecasts of future earnings are more likely to convey good news and are more optimistically biased relative to pre-terminal years. Opportunistic terminal-year forecasting behavior is: (1) more pronounced in the presence of higher CEO equity incentives and when discretionary expenditures are cut in the terminal year, and (2) less pronounced in the presence of stronger monitoring mechanisms, such as higher institutional ownership. Collectively, our results provide evidence on a potential implication of the CEO horizon problem that has not been investigated previously.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article-pdf/88/6/1909/24672/accr-50526.pdf",""

A risk indicator is a particular state of affairs that has potential predictive power about the likelihood of a risk occurring during the course of a project. This study was completed by examining eleven projects that were conducted within one division of a large engineering design firm. Projects were divided into groups according to the number of activities associated with each project, and interviews were conducted with employees, who worked in a variety of positions. A comparative analysis of risk indicators was then completed to identify potential “watch” areas and provide a basis for risk mitigation planning.

In a DISN, a large volume of data gets generated, which is first stored in the network and is later collected for further analysis when the next uploading opportunity arises. The key concern in DISNs is to be able to redistribute the data from data-generating nodes into the network under limited storage and energy constraints at the sensor nodes. We formulate the data redistribution problem where the objective is to minimize the total energy consumption during this process while guaranteeing full utilization of the distributed storage capacity in the DISNs. We show that the problem is APX-hard for arbitrary data sizes; therefore, a polynomial time approximation algorithm is unlikely. For unit data sizes, we show that the problem is equivalent to the minimum cost flow problem, which can be solved optimally. However, the optimal solution's centralized nature makes it unsuitable for large-scale distributed sensor networks. Thus, we design a distributed algorithm for the data redistribution problem which performs very close to the optimal, and compare its performance with various intuitive heuristics. The distributed algorithm relies on potential function-based computations, incurs limited message and computational overhead at both the sensor nodes and data generator nodes, and is easily implementable in a distributed manner. We analytically study the convergence and performance of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its near-optimal performance and scalability under various network scenarios. In addition, we implement the distributed algorithm in TinyOS, evaluate it using TOSSIM simulator, and show that it outperforms EnviroStore, the only existing scheme for data redistribution in sensor networks, in both solution quality and message overhead. Finally, we extend the proposed algorithm to avoid disproportionate energy consumption at different sensor nodes without compromising the solution quality.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2422966.2422968",""

Our results indicate that administrative and fiscal decentralization improve perceptions of accountability, while political decentralization does not.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fajps.12043",""

Thus, detecting GXE where G is a rare haplotype variant (rHTV) is a pressing problem. Haplotype analysis is usually the natural second step to follow up on a genomic region that is implicated to be associated through single nucleotide variants (SNV) analysis. Further, rHTV can tag associated rare SNV and provide greater power to detect them than popular collapsing methods. Recently we proposed Logistic Bayesian LASSO (LBL) for detecting rHTV association with case–control data. LBL shrinks the unassociated (especially common) haplotypes toward zero so that an associated rHTV can be identified with greater power. Here, we incorporate environmental factors and their interactions with haplotypes in LBL. As LBL is based on retrospective likelihood, this extension is not trivial. We model the joint distribution of haplotypes and covariates given the case–control status. We apply the approach (LBL‐GXE) to the Michigan, Mayo, AREDS, Pennsylvania Cohort Study on Age‐related Macular Degeneration (AMD). LBL‐GXE detects interaction of a specific rHTV in CFH gene with smoking. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in the AMD literature that an interaction of smoking with a specific (rather than pooled) rHTV has been implicated. We also carry out simulations and find that LBL‐GXE has reasonably good powers for detecting interactions with rHTV while keeping the type I error rates well controlled. Thus, we conclude that LBL‐GXE is a useful tool for uncovering missing heritability.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fgepi.21773",""

Potential conflicts of interest inherent in paid-for research challenge this recommendation. We evaluate whether paid-for research provides value to investors or merely reflects hype. Analyses of one- and two-year-ahead paid-for earnings forecasts fail to identify significant bias. Using a portfolio approach, favorable (unfavorable) paid-for recommendations yield positive (negative) stock returns at release, with upward (downward) drift over the following year. Regressing future stock returns on recommendations and valuation estimates using paid-for analysts' forecasts yields similar results. Further, results fail to indicate significant differences in paid-for and matched sell-side research. Overall, our evidence suggests that paid-for research provides relevant information for the buy-and-hold investor that is comparable to that of matched sell-side research, providing empirical support for the SEC Advisory Committee recommendation.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article-pdf/89/3/903/84744/accr-50681.pdf",""

The authors propose a forward-looking and profit-oriented metric to evaluate and demonstrate the effects of training type and incentive type on a salesperson's future value. Using a latent class modeling approach, they identify two distinct segments in the sales force that exhibit different responses to varying levels of training and incentives. This suggests that a one-size-fits-all approach to sales force management may be suboptimal. Finally, the authors also evaluate the magnitude of the proposed effects in the short run as well as the long run and show that the magnitudes of the effects could vary depending on the time horizon being considered.

We further hypothesize and test for the moderating roles of social media activity and customer characteristics on the link between social media participation and the intensity of customer-firm relationship. Importantly, we also quantify the impact of social media participation on customer profitability. We assemble a novel data set that combines customers' social media participation data with individual customer level transaction data. To account for endogeneity that could arise because of customer self-selection, we utilize the propensity score matching technique in combination with difference in differences analysis. Our results suggest that customer participation in a firm's social media efforts leads to an increase in the frequency of customer visits. We find that this participation effect is greater when there are high levels of activity in the social media site and for customers who exhibit a strong patronage with the firm, buy premium products, and exhibit lower levels of buying focus and deal sensitivity. We find that the above set of results holds for customer profitability as well. We discuss theoretical implications of our results and offer prescriptions for managers on how to engage customers via social media.

In an effort to understand these and many other consequential issues, social scientists invest substantial resources to collect large quantities of data, much of which are not fully explored. This chapter proffers the argument that privacy protection and responsible use are not the only ethical considerations related to data mining social data. Given (1) the substantial resources allocated and (2) the leverage these “big data” give on such weighty issues, this chapter suggests social scientists are ethically obligated to conduct comprehensive analysis of their data. Data mining techniques provide pertinent tools that are valuable for identifying attributes in large data sets that may be useful for addressing important issues in the social sciences. By using these comprehensive analytical processes, a researcher may discover a set of attributes that is useful for making behavioral predictions, validating social science theories, and creating rules for understanding behavior in social domains. Taken together, these attributes and values often present previously unknown knowledge that may have important applied and theoretical consequences for a domain, social scientific or otherwise.

Specifically, we claim that highly market-concentrated private banks have interests and the capacity to lobby elected politicians to liberalize capital account transactions. We then argue that politicians in particularistic democracies will respond to such lobbying pressure by dismantling capital controls as they have political incentives to cater to the interests of powerful bankers.

Method. A prospective, quasi-experimental, repeated-measure design tested pre- and post-A1C and diabetes knowledge using the SKILLD scale. The sample consisted of 71 in the intervention group and 64 controls. Results. Most participants were female, marginally acculturated, and, on average, 60 years of age. Both groups were similar in baseline diabetes knowledge score (median 6 out of 10), and higher literacy was significantly related to increased baseline knowledge. The intervention group significantly improved at follow-up compared with the controls: Participants in the intervention with low baseline knowledge scores had a mean follow-up score of 5.6; those with a high baseline score had a mean score of 7.6. The intervention cohort scored significantly better in knowing why to see an eye doctor, what are normal fasting blood glucose and A1C, and understanding long-term diabetes complications. Increased knowledge of a normal fasting blood glucose level had a significant effect on follow-up A1C in the intervention group. Conclusion. The intervention favorably affects diabetes knowledge, and the SKILLD scale has utility with low-literate Hispanic/Latinos. The significant impact on A1C by diabetes knowledge gain shows that the empowerment-based diabetes self-management education was successful for this ethnic population.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1524839912474006",""

Consequently, a wide range of topographic measurement methods have evolved. Despite the range of available methods, the production of high resolution, high quality digital elevation models (DEMs) requires a significant investment in personnel time, hardware and/or software. However, image‐based methods such as digital photogrammetry have been decreasing in costs. Developed for the purpose of rapid, inexpensive and easy three‐dimensional surveys of buildings or small objects, the ‘structure from motion’ photogrammetric approach (SfM) is an image‐based method which could deliver a methodological leap if transferred to geomorphic applications, requires little training and is extremely inexpensive. Using an online SfM program, we created high‐resolution digital elevation models of a river environment from ordinary photographs produced from a workflow that takes advantage of free and open source software. This process reconstructs real world scenes from SfM algorithms based on the derived positions of the photographs in three‐dimensional space. The basic product of the SfM process is a point cloud of identifiable features present in the input photographs. This point cloud can be georeferenced from a small number of ground control points collected in the field or from measurements of camera positions at the time of image acquisition. The georeferenced point cloud can then be used to create a variety of digital elevation products. We examine the applicability of SfM in the Pedernales River in Texas (USA), where several hundred images taken from a hand‐held helikite are used to produce DEMs of the fluvial topographic environment. This test shows that SfM and low‐altitude platforms can produce point clouds with point densities comparable with airborne LiDAR, with horizontal and vertical precision in the centimeter range, and with very low capital and labor costs and low expertise levels.

The expected utility approach underlying portfolio advice based on financial economics assumes that a household has some level of risk aversion that determines its utility from different wealth or consumption levels. Therefore, a household's risk aversion or its inverse—risk tolerance—is a key factor in determining the optimal portfolio for a household. Risk tolerance measures that offer choices without context as to how potential consumption would change do not provide estimates that measure the concept of risk aversion assumed in standard expected utility analyses of portfolio choices. Behavioral finance approaches, including prospect theory, may better explain household investment choices, but a consensus does not exist in regard to how to incorporate these approaches into rigorous portfolio recommendations. Risk capacity, based on human wealth and the investment horizon, is also crucial in determining optimal portfolio advice. This chapter provides a discussion of methods for estimating risk tolerance and the limitations of alternative measures.","https://academic.oup.com/book/chapter-pdf/45016360/book_3188_section_144097437.ag.pdf",""

We examined which characteristics at baseline predicted the development of T2DM versus maintenance of IGT or conversion to normal glucose tolerance. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 228 subjects at high risk with IGT who received treatment with placebo in ACT NOW and who underwent baseline anthropometric measures and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at baseline and after a mean follow-up of 2.4 years. RESULTS: In a univariate analysis, 45 of 228 (19.7%) IGT individuals developed diabetes. After adjusting for age, sex, and center, increased fasting plasma glucose, 2-h plasma glucose, ∆G0–120 during OGTT, HbA1c, adipocyte insulin resistance index, ln fasting plasma insulin, and ln ∆I0–120, as well as family history of diabetes and presence of metabolic syndrome, were associated with increased risk of diabetes. At baseline, higher insulin secretion (ln [∆I0–120/∆G0–120]) during the OGTT was associated with decreased risk of diabetes. Higher β-cell function (insulin secretion/insulin resistance or disposition index; ln [∆I0–120/∆G0–120 × Matsuda index of insulin sensitivity]; odds ratio 0.11; P &lt; 0.0001) was the variable most closely associated with reduced risk of diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: In a stepwise multiple-variable analysis, only HbA1c and β-cell function (ln insulin secretion/insulin resistance index) predicted the development of diabetes (r = 0.49; P &lt; 0.0001).","https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/36/11/3607/614215/3607.pdf",""

However, is this necessarily the case? In fact, we argue and show that presidents are able to manipulate the foreign policy agenda and make tactical choices regarding when to emphasize foreign policy issues in order to advance their policy preferences. We argue that presidents’ weekly radio addresses to the nation represent one such expression of presidential agenda-setting that scholars have largely neglected. It is our contention that presidents use these speeches to direct or redirect domestic attention away from some issues and toward others. We model the president’s foreign policy agenda, as expressed in the choice of issues selected for the weekly radio addresses, as a function of the president’s policy preferences regarding the US domestic political environment and the international environment and other key factors.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2233865913478247",""

In particular, the interwell relaxation or Rabi oscillations, resulting, respectively, from the multi- or single-mode interaction, can produce effective crossovers, leading to electromagnetically induced interference in microwave driven qubits. The environment is modeled by a multimode thermal bath, generating the interwell relaxation. Relaxation induced interference, independent of the tunnel coupling, provides deeper understanding to the interaction between the qubits and their environment. It also supplies a useful tool to characterize the relaxation strength as well as the characteristic frequency of the bath. In addition, we demonstrate the relaxation can generate population inversion in a strongly driving two-level system. On the other hand, different from Rabi oscillations, Rabi-oscillation-induced interference involves more complicated and modulated photon exchange thus offers an alternative means to manipulate the qubit, with more controllable parameters including the strength and position of the tunnel coupling. It also provides a testing ground for exploring nonlinear quantum phenomena and quantum state manipulation in qubits either with or without crossover structure.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/ltp/article-pdf/39/6/503/15647584/503_1_online.pdf",""

Countless studies have shown that urban African American and Latino students are systematically denied educational resources in comparison to their white counterparts, resulting in persistent achievement disparities. Though this research is thorough in many regards, it consistently lacks the voices of the Latino and African American students themselves. This omission not only silences those most affected by educational inequalities, it also denies the research community valuable insights. Purpose: This article discusses an analysis of a youth participatory action research (YPAR) program, the Council of Youth Research, in which urban youth of color research educational conditions. We address the following research questions: 1. How do the Council youth appropriate traditional tools of research? How do they adapt and transform these tools to serve their purposes? 2. What methodological insights can adult educational researchers draw from the study of an intervention project that seeks to center the voice and perspectives of youth? 3. How does YPAR as it is practiced by Council youth challenge what is considered as legitimate and transformative research? Research Design: To address our research questions, we conducted ethnographic research on the Council during the summer of 2010 and the 2010-2011 school year. Findings: We demonstrate how the students in the Council appropriated traditional research methods for critical uses and employed creative approaches to conveying research findings. We focus on the students’ use of participant observation, database analysis, and interviews, and describe the multimodal avenues through which the students conveyed findings. Conclusion: Our study points to alternatives to traditional research that take advantage of urban students’ positionality and insights. We argue that the perspective of youth of color, especially in working-class, urban areas, is integral to our understanding of problems in urban schools as well as approaches to transforming inequitable learning conditions and structures. Until we make the power of research accessible to young people and other marginalized communities, educational research will be limited in its scope and impact.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/016146811311501005",""

Further, in this study the authors also examined whether the language of instruction affected English, Spanish, and conceptual vocabulary differentially. Method: The authors randomly assigned 202 preschool DLLs with language impairment to 1 of 4 conditions: bilingual vocabulary, English-only vocabulary, bilingual mathematics, or English-only mathematics. Fifty-four DLLs with typical development received no intervention. The vocabulary intervention consisted of a 12-week small-group dialogic reading and hands-on vocabulary instruction of 45 words. Postintervention group differences and linear growth rates were examined in conceptual, English, and Spanish receptive and expressive vocabulary for the 45 treatment words. Results: Results indicate that the bilingual vocabulary intervention facilitated receptive and expressive Spanish and conceptual vocabulary gains in DLLs with language impairment compared with the English vocabulary intervention, mathematics intervention, and no-intervention groups. The English-only vocabulary intervention differed significantly from the mathematics condition and no-intervention groups on all measures but did not differ from the bilingual vocabulary intervention. Vocabulary growth rates postintervention slowed considerably. Results support the idea that bilingual interventions support native- and second-language vocabulary development. Conclusion: English-only intervention supports only English.

We combine explanations based on tournament theory and equity theory to develop a model wherein pay dispersion has opposing effects on a firm’s short-term performance and their trend in performance over time. We also show that ownership is a key antecedent of pay dispersion. Specifically, transient institutional investors (who have short time horizons and equity stakes in a wide variety of firms) positively influence pay dispersion whereas dedicated institutional investors (who have longer investment time horizons and equity stakes in fewer firms) negatively influence pay dispersion. We discuss the wide-ranging implications of these findings for scholars, managers, and policy makers alike.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0149206313503015",""

There is also growing interest by those outside the university community to use these metrics to evaluate faculty and broader academic performance. Purpose (Hypothesis): This study seeks to understand if and how course and instructor characteristics affect SETs and thereby to improve the usefulness of these metrics. This article aims to statistically examine the relationship between course and instructor characteristics and SETs. Design/Method: SETs from a large engineering college at a major public university were evaluated over a seven‐semester period that covered 3938 courses taught by 549 unique engineering instructors. Course and instructor demographic data were statistically evaluated for their effects on SETs. Results: Course characteristics such as class size, course level, and whether a course was an elective or required had statistically significant effects on SETs. Instructor characteristics of gender and academic rank affected SETs and average course grades, respectively. Average course grades were positively correlated with SETs. Conclusions: Data analysis showed that course characteristics, faculty demographics, and average course grades had statistically significant effects on SETs; however, in some cases the effect sizes of these variables were small. Administrators and senior faculty members should be cognizant of these relevant factors and their effects when assigning faculty to certain courses and evaluating their teaching effectiveness using SETs.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fjee.20013",""

Therefore, our goal was to conduct a case‐control study examining the association between estimated maternal residential exposure to benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylene (BTEX) and the risk of oral clefts among offspring. METHODS: Data on 6045 nonsyndromic isolated oral cleft cases (3915 cleft lip with or without cleft palate [CL ± P] and 2130 nonsyndromic isolated cleft palate [CP] cases) delivered between 1999 and 2008 were obtained from the Texas Birth Defects Registry. The control group was a sample of unaffected live births, frequency matched to cases on year of birth. Census tract‐level estimates of annual average exposures were obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2005 Hazardous Air Pollutant Exposure Model (HAPEM5) for each pollutant and assigned to each subject based on maternal residence during pregnancy. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between estimated maternal exposure to each pollutant (BTEX) separately and the risk of oral clefts in offspring. RESULTS: High estimated maternal exposure to benzene was not associated with oral clefts, compared with low estimated exposure (CL ± P adjusted OR = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.81 − 1.12; CP adjusted OR = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.67 − 1.09).

Given the complexity of planning and environmental reviews associated with planning a high-speed intercity passenger rail corridor, a systematic approach for high-level screening of various alternative routings for proposed high-speed rail corridors is desirable. In this context, a multicriteria decision-making framework was proposed to assist planners of high-speed rail with the preliminary screening and ranking of potential high-speed rail corridors. The proposed framework was applied to the question of ranking 13 alternative routings for connecting the South Central and Gulf Coast federally designated highspeed rail corridors located in Texas. Attributes that were incorporated into the decision framework include population, travel demand, capital costs, land use and environmental impacts, and engineering suitability. Although the developed framework cannot be used to replace the environmental review process and formal alternatives analysis completely, it can be used by planners as a tool for preliminary screening or ranking of proposed high-speed rail corridors for detailed analysis.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/2374-04",""

Moreover, scanning SHG images of APB-rich layers reveal microstructure lacking in APB-free layers. We attribute these findings to the sign reversal of the second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility χijk(2) between neighbouring anti-phase domains within the incident laser spot.

Using the twin and full-sibling subsample from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), behavioral genetic methodology is used to examine whether delinquent peer affiliation and delinquency in adolescence covary as the result of common genetic factors. Results indicate that delinquent peer association and delinquency are moderately influenced by additive genetic factors, and that common genes are in fact influencing the covariance between the two outcomes.

Low self‐control, in particular, represents a trait thought to directly increase the risk of victimization. At the same time, different lines of evidence suggest that genetic factors account for portions of the variance in both self‐control and victimization. These findings leave open the possibility that the two traits might covary because of previously unmeasured genetic factors. The current analysis seeks to test this possibility. Additionally, we examine whether the covariation between self‐control and victimization persists once genetic effects are held constant.

The relationship between spirituality and delinquency was completely mediated by social developmental factors as no direct association was identified between spirituality and delinquency.

Detailed discussions are devoted to the etch mechanisms of low-k materials and their degradation during the plasma processing. The problem of k-value degradation (plasma damage) is a key issue for the integration, and it is becoming more difficult and challenging as the dielectric constant of low-k materials scales down. Results obtained with new experimental methods, like the small gap technique and multi-beams systems with separated sources of ions, vacuum ultraviolet light, and radicals, are discussed in detail. The methods allowing reduction of plasma damage and restoration of dielectric properties of damaged low-k materials are also discussed.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.4765297/14638119/041101_1_online.pdf",""

Focus was placed on the ISCCP cloud regimes containing the majority of upper level clouds in the tropics, i.e., mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), deep cumulonimbus with cirrus, mixed shallow and deep convection, and thin cirrus. At upper levels, these regimes have average maximum cloud occurrences ranging from 30% to 55% near 12 km with variations depending on the location and cloud regime.

Data Sources: PubMed database of the National Library of Medicine. Review Methods: Three subpanels with co‐chairs comprising experts in the virology, bacteriology, and immunology of otitis media were formed. Each of the panels reviewed the literature in their respective fields and wrote draft reviews. The reviews were shared with all panel members, and a second draft was created. The entire panel met at the 10th International Symposium on Recent Advances in Otitis Media in June 2011 and discussed the review and refined the content further. A final draft was created, circulated, and approved by the panel. Conclusion: Excellent progress has been made in the past 4 years in advancing an understanding of the microbiology and immunology of otitis media. Advances include laboratory‐based basic studies, cell‐based assays, work in animal models, and clinical studies. Implications for Practice: The advances of the past 4 years formed the basis of a series of short‐term and long‐term research goals in an effort to guide the field. Accomplishing these goals will provide opportunities for the development of novel interventions, including new ways to better treat and prevent otitis media.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0194599812459636",""

From the principle of detailed balance, it is shown quantitatively that mirror solar cells have greater voltage and power conversion efficiency than their substrate counterparts. Next, the radiative recombination coefficient and maximum radiative lifetime of GaAs mirror and substrate solar cells are calculated and compared to the nonradiative Auger and Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) lifetimes. Mirror solar cells have greater radiative lifetime than their substrate variants. Auger lifetime exceeds radiative lifetime for both substrate and mirror cells while SRH lifetime may be less or greater than radiative lifetime depending on trap concentration and capture cross section. Finally, the change in free energy of the photogenerated carriers is analyzed in a comparison between InP, GaAs, CdTe, and Ga0.5In0.5P mirror and substrate solar cells in order to characterize the relationship between solar photon quality and free energy management in solar cells with differing bandgaps. Wider bandgap visible threshold Ga0.5In0.5P solar cells make better use of the available change in free energy of the photogenerated charge carriers, even when normalized to the bandgap energy, than narrower bandgap near-IR threshold InP, GaAs, and CdTe solar cells.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.4829459/15125241/174507_1_online.pdf",""

Supersized products may be attractive to consumers from the standpoint of the unit pricing because ordering a larger size of the same product results in a per-unit savings and offers consumers the opportunity to meet their value-based financial goals. In this article, the authors show that such pricing strategies not only lead to greater purchase and consumption but do so by affecting important consumer goals in unrelated domains—namely, by decreasing the importance placed on health goals. Although supersized pricing can have a powerful effect on purchase behavior, providing health cues can prevent the decreased focus on health. In addition, supersized pricing can be used to increase size choice of healthy foods. The authors discuss the study's contributions to theory, particularly for understanding decisions regarding the pursuit of multiple goals and, more specifically, those that lie at the intersection of health and finance. In addition, the results suggest both marketing and public policy implications, including those for the obesity epidemic and frequent use of supersized pricing strategies for unhealthy foods.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1509/jm.11.0261",""

To solve the preceding problems, in this article, we propose a novel geometric coding algorithm, to encode the spatial context among local features for large-scale partial-duplicate Web image retrieval. Our geometric coding consists of geometric square coding and geometric fan coding, which describe the spatial relationships of SIFT features into three geo-maps for global verification to remove geometrically inconsistent SIFT matches. Our approach is not only computationally efficient, but also effective in detecting partial-duplicate images with rotation, scale changes, partial-occlusion, and background clutter.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2422956.2422960",""

Of restaurant patrons seeing the logo, 74.6% selected PV items. The environmental assessment indicated a variety of marketing techniques in both settings and frequency of marketing techniques across all sites were observed. Greater frequency of the PV logo and supporting information was observed in the institutional settings. Lastly, restaurant stakeholders indicated a need for more information of the PV program.

This is the second paper in a series of papers on testing individual skill level differences in engineers and engineering students. In the first paper, we reported on the theoretical and empirical basis for divergent thinking test, as well as, on test formulation, data collection, norming studies, and statistical validation of that test. This paper focuses similarly on the efforts related to the visual thinking and spatial reasoning in engineering context. We have decomposed visual thinking into six categories: visual comprehension including perceptual speed, visual memory (that is, the visual memory system), visual synthesis mental image manipulation/transformation, spatial reasoning, and graphical expression/elaboration. We discuss the theoretical basis of a comprehensive test for engineers, test composition, trial runs, and computation of reliability measures. The alpha version was given to a small set of subjects to determine clarity of the questions and gauge difficulty level. The beta version was used for norming and test validation from over 500 samples that included engineering students and a smaller number of practicing engineers. Construct validation was achieved through basing the construction of our instrument off other well-known measures of visual thinking, while content validity was assured through thoroughly sampling the domain of visual thinking and including a variety of items both pertinent and specific to the engineering design process. The factor analysis reveals that there are possibly two eigenvalues above 1.0, an indication that it is a stable and accurate instrument. We emphasize that these tests are not just dependent on native abilities, but on education and experience; design skills are teachable and learnable.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/mechanicaldesign/article-pdf/doi/10.1115/1.4024228/6222486/md_135_7_071004.pdf",""

However, lipid droplets occur in essentially all plant cell types, many of which may not require oleosin-mediated stabilization. The proteins associated with the surface of nonseed lipid droplets, which are likely to influence the formation, stability, and turnover of this compartment, remain to be elucidated. Here, we have combined lipidomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic studies of avocado (Persea americana) mesocarp to identify two new lipid droplet-associated proteins, which we named LDAP1 and LDAP2. These proteins are highly similar to each other and also to the small rubber particle proteins that accumulate in rubber-producing plants. An Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) homolog to LDAP1 and LDAP2, At3g05500, was localized to the surface of lipid droplets after transient expression in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) cells that were induced to accumulate triacylglycerols. We propose that small rubber particle protein-like proteins are involved in the general process of binding and perhaps the stabilization of lipid-rich particles in the cytosol of plant cells and that the avocado and Arabidopsis protein members reveal a new aspect of the cellular machinery that is involved in the packaging of triacylglycerols in plant tissues.","http://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-pdf/162/4/1926/37170507/plphys_v162_4_1926.pdf",""

Going beyond the second order perturbation expansion, we find a time dependent stationary population evolution as well as unsymmetrical microwave driven Landau–Zener transitions, resulting from the nonresonant terms which are neglected in rotating-wave approximation. For the low-frequency driving, the qubit population at equilibrium is a periodical function of time, owing to the contribution of the nonresonant terms. In order to obtain the average population, it is found that the average approximation based on the perturbation approach can be applied to the low-frequency region. For the extremely low frequency which is much smaller than the decoherence rate, we develop noncoherence approximation by dividing the evolution into discrete time steps during which the coherence is lost totally. These approximations present comprehensive analytical descriptions of LZS interference in most of parameter space of frequency and decoherence rate, agreeing well with those of the numerical simulations and providing a simple but integrated understanding to system dynamics. The application of our models to microwave cooling can obtain the minimal frequency to realize effective microwave cooling.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/ltp/article-pdf/39/8/665/13714181/665_1_online.pdf",""

However, chemotherapy resistance develops rapidly in relapsed and/or refractory aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHL). Development of novel target drugs and regimens may help address these clinical issues. Our phase I/II clinical trial confirms that lenalidomide plus rituximab (LR) is well tolerated and effective for patients with relapsed and/or refractory B-cell NHL. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the data from our clinical trials of LR in aggressive NHL patients [Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular grade 3 lymphoma (FLG3) and transformed large cell lymphoma (TL)](Wang et al., Lancet Oncol 13:716-23, 2012; Wang et al., Leukemia 2013 Apr 2) and provided further details and longer follow-up on the efficacy and safety of novel combination of LR followed by SCT. Patients enrolled in our clinical trials received oral lenalidomide 20 mg once daily on days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle and 375mg/m2 of intravenous rituximab once a week for four weeks only during cycle one, beginning on day 1. Patients were treated with LR until disease progression, SCT, or withdrawal due to toxicity. Overall survival (OS) was defined as time from study entry to the date of death or until the last survival date if still alive. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as time from study entry to the date of disease progression or death. Results: From March 31, 2006 to December 15, 2010, twenty-two patients were enrolled in our study and underwent SCT after receiving LR combination. Patients received either allogeneic (n=16) or autologous (n=6) SCT following the study treatment. The median age of the patients was 59.5 years (range, 46-74), and 18 of them were male. The median time from diagnosis to initiation of LR therapy was 25.5 months (range, 3-99.4). The median number of previous treatment regimens was two (range, 1-4). Five (23%) patients received SCT before enrolling in our study. All patients had received previous rituximab-containing treatments. Histologies were: MCL (n=12), DLBCL (n=5), FLG3 (n=1) and TL (n=4). Of the sixteen patients who proceeded to allogeneic SCT, two were given myeloablative conditioning regimens, the remaining fourteen were given the reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens. The preparative regimens were FCR(fludarabine + cyclophosphamide + rituximab) in 2 patients, FCR plus alemtuzumab in 2, or plus alemtuzumab and low dose TBI(total body irradiation) in 3, or plus Ibritumomab Tiuxetan(zevalin) in 3, fludarabine+bendamustine/ rituximab in 2, fludarabine+ busulfan in 1 and others in 3. All of the six patients who proceeded to auto-SCT were given R-BEAM( rituximab, BCNU, etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan) regimen. Eleven patients underwent SCT from a matched unrelated donor and five from a matched sibling donor. The median time from best response date of LR regimen to SCT date was 4 months (range 1-14). Conclusions: The results suggest that the novel combination of LR is an effective and safe regimen, and may offer a bridge to SCT in patients with relapsed and/or refractory aggressive B-cell NHL.

X-ray diffraction measurements coupled with Rietveld refinement indicate that the CFMO materials crystallize in the inverse cubic spinel phase. Temperature (T = 300 K and 10 K) dependent magnetization (M(H)) measurements indicate the long range ferromagnetic ordering in CoFe2−xMnxO4 (x = 0.00–0.15) ferrites. The cubic anisotropy constant (K1(T)) and saturation magnetization (Ms(T)) were derived by using the “law of approach” to saturation that describes the field dependence of M(H) for magnetic fields much higher than the coercive field (Hc). Saturation magnetization (Ms), obtained from the model, decreases with increasing temperature. For CoFe2O4, Ms decreases from 3.63 μB per formula unit (f.u.) to 3.47 μB/f.u. with increasing temperature from 10 to 300 K. CFMO (0.00–0.15) exhibit the similar trend while the magnitude of Ms is dependent on Mn-concentration. Ms-T functional relationship obeys the Bloch's law.

The interleukin-10 knockout mouse is a genetic model of this progression. We report that knockout mice fed 5% black raspberries (BRB) had significantly less colonic ulceration as compared with knockout mice that consumed the control diet. Dysfunction of the Wnt signaling pathway is a key event in ulcerative colitis–associated colon carcinogenesis. Therefore, we investigated the effects of BRBs on the Wnt pathway and found that the BRB-fed knockout mice exhibited a significantly lower level of β-catenin nuclear translocation. We followed-up this observation by evaluating the effect of BRBs on selected Wnt pathway antagonists. The mRNA expression levels of wif1, sox17, and qki were diminished in the knockout mice, whereas they were expressed at normal levels in knockout mice that were fed BRBs. The lower mRNA expression of these genes in the colon from the knockout mice correlated with hypermethylation of their promoter regions; BRBs decreased their promoter methylation and increased mRNA expression of these genes. This hypomethylation was associated with elevated protein expression of key proteins/enzymes that augment methylation, for example, dnmt3b, hdac1, hdac2, and mbd2 in the knockout mice; in addition, BRBs decreased the protein expression of these proteins/enzymes. The knockout mouse model recapitulates what occurs in human ulcerative colitis. Promoter methylation of CDH1 and SFRP1 was significantly higher in human ulcerative colitis tissues compared with their adjacent normal tissues. In conclusion, our results suggest that BRBs inhibit colonic ulceration and, ultimately, colon cancer partly through inhibiting aberrant epigenetic events that dysregulate Wnt signaling.

Of the several techniques developed, precompaction mellowing has the potential to be effective in stabilizing sulfate-bearing soils. Yet this method needs experimental evaluation. In the current study, an attempt was made to assess the stabilization effectiveness of precompaction mellowing on high-sulfate soils. For this task, six natural expansive soils from Texas, with sulfate contents varying from 200 to 44,000 ppm, were collected. Soils with low-sulfate contents were spiked with additional sulfates to make them high-sulfate soils. Basic classification and chemical tests were performed to establish the clay mineralogy of the soils. Three mellowing periods (0, 3, and 7 days) were studied. The test soils were treated with lime and allowed to mellow for the specified periods. Following the mellowing, the samples were subjected to three-dimensional tests for volumetric swell, shrinkage, and unconfined compressive strength (UCS). To study the consumptions of alumina and silica during sulfate–soil–lime reactions, reactive alumina and silica measurements were also attempted. The authors observed that shrinkage was of no concern in treated soils because the shrinkage invariably reduced with lime treatment. In four of the six soils, precompaction mellowing reduced sulfate-induced swell to a level below the natural expansive swelling. The UCS strengths of treated soils decreased slightly with mellowing. Reasons for the anomaly in UCS strengths and ineffectiveness of precompaction mellowing in two soils were explained.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/2363-11",""

Hence, we need to understand engineering students' awareness, conceptions, and, particularly, their prior knowledge and what shaped it. Purpose: This study proposed to examine the impact of their home location on engineering students' environmental awareness and resistance to change. Design/Method: We administered two environmental surveys to students in a first‐year undergraduate engineering program. First, a macrolevel analysis focused on differences between students from different U.S. regions and international students. Then, to examine differences hypothesized in our environmental awareness model at the zip code‐level (students' household location, i.e., location from which they applied to college), we focused on first‐year engineering students with Indiana zip codes ( Results: Significant differences appeared in environmental awareness and knowledge according to students' household location (U.S. regions and international). As a result, we created a predictive model of the students' environmental knowledge, awareness, attitudes, and resistance to change using a GIS location‐based model. Conclusions: This study extends the existing literature and provides a starting point for further exploring these relationships with engineering students. Since engineering programs provide different experiences to students, this study cautiously supports the idea that student household location has an impact and should be considered a viable variable. Further work is necessary to study the impact of location‐based class projects on the students' awareness and knowledge about sustainability and environmental issues.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jee.20028",""

A better approach to assess the effectiveness of these monetary transfers is by comparing this method to alternative policies—like the traditional monetary injections through the financial intermediaries. A limited participation model calibrated to the U.S. economy is used to show that the higher the proportion of the monetary injection channeled through the consumers—instead of banks—leads to a less vigorous recovery of output but softens the detrimental effect on the utility of the representative household from the inherent inflationary pressure.

Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures. SE is an emergency condition associated with continuous seizures lasting more than 30 min. It causes significant mortality and morbidity. SE can cause devastating damage to the brain leading to cognitive impairment and increased risk of epilepsy. Benzodiazepines are the first-line drugs for the treatment of SE, however, many people exhibit partial or complete resistance due to a breakdown of GABA inhibition. Therefore, new drugs with neuroprotective effects against the SE-induced neuronal injury and degeneration are desirable. Animal models are used to study the pathophysiology of SE and for the discovery of newer anticonvulsants. In SE paradigms, seizures are induced in rodents by chemical agents or by electrical stimulation of brain structures. Electrical stimulation includes perforant path and self-sustaining stimulation models. Pharmacological models include kainic acid, pilocarpine, flurothyl, organophosphates and other convulsants that induce SE in rodents. Neuronal injury occurs within the initial SE episode, and animals exhibit cognitive dysfunction and spontaneous seizures several weeks after this precipitating event. Current SE models have potential applications but have some limitations. In general, the experimental SE model should be analogous to the human seizure state and it should share very similar neuropathological mechanisms. The pilocarpine and diisopropylfluorophosphate models are associated with prolonged, diazepam-insensitive seizures and neurodegeneration and therefore represent paradigms of refractory SE. Novel mechanism-based or clinically relevant models are essential to identify new therapies for SE and neuroprotective interventions.","https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/14/9/18284/pdf",""

As Ts increases from 550 to 700 °C, the morphology changes from granular to smooth film and finally to rough film. X-ray diffraction shows the presence of VO2 along with additional weak features related to the presence of non-stoichiometric phases. Electrical measurements show the phase transition to change from abrupt to gradual as both the below- and above-transition resistivities vary with Ts. The transition and hysteresis dependences observed in electrical resistivity are similarly observed in infrared transmission. Terahertz transmission measurements show that high conductivity above the phase transition is more important in achieving high modulation depth than obtaining high resistivity below the transition. We attribute changes in the electrical and optical properties to the formation of V and O vacancies, which result in diverse valence states from the ideal V4+ of VO2. Low Ts produces material with V5+ states resulting in higher resistivity in both the insulating and metallic phases. Alternatively, high Ts introduces material with V3+ states leading to lower resistivity in the insulating phase but slightly higher resistivity in the metallic phase.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.4821846/15116979/113509_1_online.pdf",""

In this study, we used the transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor (TRPV1) receptor agonist, capsaicin, as an intranasal challenge while comparing the changes in blood flow with optical rhinometry between subjects with NAIR and healthy controls (HCs). Methods: Six HCs and 6 NAIR subjects were challenged intranasally with saline solution followed by increasing concentrations of capsaicin (0.005 mM, 0.05 mM, and 0.5 mM) at 15‐minute intervals. We recorded maximum optical density (OD) and numeric analog scores (NAS) for nasal congestion, nasal irritation, rhinorrhea, and sneezing for each subject after each challenge. Correlations between NAS and maximum OD were calculated. Results: Maximum OD increased with increasing concentrations of intranasal capsaicin in NAIR subjects. There were significant differences in maximum OD obtained for 0.05 mM and 0.5 mM capsaicin between NAIR subjects and HCs. Significant differences were found in the NAS for nasal irritation at 0.005 mM, 0.05 mM, and 0.5 mM, and nasal congestion at 0.5 mM.

This article sets out to provide a descriptive portrait of intermittency and in so doing aims to understand and explain intermittency within and between individuals, how it varies with age over the life course, and how it covaries with the seriousness of offending. Longer intermittency is characteristic of offenders with earlier onset as well as those who offend less frequently, whereas high-frequency/early-onset offenders have less intermittency. Findings suggest that intermittent gaps between offenses relate to offense seriousness. As offenders age, the gaps between offenses increase. Each of these effects is disaggregated among chronic and nonchronic (recidivist) offenders to demonstrate the intermittent patterns of different criminal careers. Implications for theoretical and empirical research on intermittency are highlighted.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0011128712466382",""

The fluidic substrate was fabricated using a single-step, double-sided hot embossing in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) with sampling zone microchannels on the bottom side and microlenses on the top. Shallow sampling zone microchannels (5 μm deep and 100 μm wide) were made to improve sampling efficiency and microlenses were adopted to collect the fluorescent radiation from the sampling zone microchannels. A cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) embedded waveguide in PMMA along with an integrated coupling prism was fabricated using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stencils and melted COC (40% w/v in toluene) on the cover plate. The COC waveguide with a COC integrated coupling prism will be used for evanescent excitation of fluorescent samples in the sampling zone microchannels. The fluidic substrate was bonded with the cover plate using thermal fusion bonding based on a pressure-assisted boiling point control system. This approach allowed for sealing of shallow microchannels without observable sagging of the cover plate, which was confirmed by leakage testing with fluorescent dyes. The completed SMD module will be tested for characterization of the optical performances such as signal-to-noise ratio and sampling efficiency and it will provide the capability for rapid screening of stroke at low cost.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2013-65524/4234013/v010t11a006-imece2013-65524.pdf",""

The answer to this question has important implications for our understanding of why many small proteins fold with two state kinetics. When the equilibration within the unfolded state U is much faster than the folding, the folding kinetics will be two state even if there are many folding pathways with different barriers. Yet the mean first passage times (MFPTs) between different regions of the unfolded state can be much longer than the folding time. This seems to imply that the equilibration within U is much slower than the folding. In this communication we resolve this paradox. We present a formula for estimating the time to equilibrate the unfolded state of a protein. We also present a formula for the MFPT to any state within U, which is proportional to the average lifetime of that state divided by the state population. This relation is valid when the equilibration within U is very fast as compared with folding as it often is for small proteins. To illustrate the concepts, we apply the formulas to estimate the time to equilibrate the unfolded state of Trp‐cage and MFPTs within the unfolded state based on a Markov State Model using an ultra‐long 208 microsecond trajectory of the miniprotein to parameterize the model. The time to equilibrate the unfolded state of Trp‐cage is ∼100 ns while the typical MFPTs within U are tens of microseconds or longer.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fpro.2335",""

Our goal was to identify and quantify emission sources within the largest industrial facility in Texas City most likely responsible for measured concentrations of benzene, an important VOC and hazardous air pollutant. The Houston Advanced Research Center inverse air quality model has been used to infer benzene emission rates from all potential source locations that could account for the benzene concentrations measured by the mobile lab in the vicinity of the facility. A Positive Matrix Factorization receptor model was also applied to the concentrations measured by the mobile lab, the results of which strongly supported the source attribution specified by the inverse model. The two independent source apportionment techniques both implicated flare, storage tank, and ultraformer units in the facility as significant contributors to emission plumes of elevated benzene concentrations observed by the mobile lab. The emissions of some of the flare and tank units were found to be greater than reported in emission inventories by about an order of magnitude.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fjgrd.50586",""

We identified miR-23b and miR-27b as miRNAs that are highly upregulated in human breast cancer. We found that engineered knockdown of miR-23b and miR-27b substantially repressed breast cancer growth. Nischarin (NISCH) expression was augmented by knockdown of miR-23b as well as miR-27b. Notably, these miRNAs and Nischarin were inversely expressed in human breast cancers, underscoring their biologic relevance. We showed the clinical relevance of the expression of these miRNAs and showed that high expression of miR-23b and miR-27b correlates with poor outcome in breast cancer. Moreover, intraperitoneally delivered anti-miR-27b restored Nischarin expression and decreased tumor burden in a mouse xenograft model of human mammary tumor. Also, we report for the first time that HER2/neu (ERBB2), EGF, and TNF-α promote miR-23b/27b expression through the AKT/NF-κB signaling cascade. Nischarin was found to regulate miR-27b/23b expression through a feedback loop mechanism by suppressing NF-κB phosphorylation.

The fabrication technique described herein is highly adaptable and allows for fine control over the resulting nerve guide architecture in terms of channel number, channel diameter, porosity, and mechanical properties. Biomimetic multichanneled CUPE guides were fabricated with various channel numbers and displayed an ultimate peak stress of 1.38 ± 0.22 MPa with a corresponding elongation at break of 122.76 ± 42.17%, which were comparable to that of native nerve tissue.

In this paper, we formalize the interaction effect of IT by focusing on one core function, namely, research and development (R&D). We hypothesize that investments in IT can interact with and complement a firm's R&D investments, enhancing the firm's shareholder value creation potential. We test this by hypothesis by estimating the interaction impact of IT and R&D investments on Tobin's q, a forward-looking measure of firm performance using a recent multiyear, firm-level, archival data set. Our results suggest that the interaction effect of R&D and IT on Tobin's q is positive and significant after controlling for other firm- and industry-specific effects. Our findings provide rigorous empirical support for recent anecdotal evidence in the managerial literature with respect to the manner in which IT is enabling R&D-intensive innovation processes.

This paper explores how the spring snow depth relates to subsequent precipitation in central Canada using ground observations, reanalysis datasets, and offline land surface model estimates. After removal of low-frequency ocean influences, April snow depth is found to correlate negatively with early warm-season (May–June) precipitation across a large portion of the study area. A chain of mechanisms is hypothesized to account for this observed negative relation: 1) a snow depth anomaly leads to a soil moisture anomaly, 2) the subsequent soil moisture anomaly affects ground turbulent fluxes, and 3) the atmospheric vertical structure allows dry soil to promote local convection. A detailed analysis supports this chain of mechanisms for those portions of the domain manifesting a statistically significant negative snow–precipitation correlation. For a portion of the study area, large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns also affect the early warm-season rainfall, indicating that the snow–precipitation feedback may depend on large-scale atmospheric dynamical features. This analysis suggests that spring snow conditions can contribute to warm-season precipitation predictability on a subseasonal to seasonal scale, but that the strength of such predictability varies geographically as it depends on the interplay of hydroclimatological conditions across multiple spatial scales.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jhm/article-pdf/14/3/787/4117288/jhm-d-12-029_1.pdf",""

Haphazard sampling is a nonstatistical technique used by auditors to simulate random sampling when testing the error status of accounting populations. Our study compared the properties of haphazard samples selected from control listings with the properties of random samples. We hypothesized that haphazard samples differ from random samples because the haphazard selection process is influenced by: (1) auditor behaviors intended to minimize sample selection effort and to ensure a diversified sample composition, and (2) variations in the appearance of control listing entries. Results from three experiments confirmed multiple differences between haphazard samples and random samples, and suggest that haphazard sampling may not be a reliable substitute for random sampling. In the absence of effective remediation procedures, continued use of haphazard sampling may expose auditors to additional audit, legal, and regulatory risk.","https://publications.aaahq.org/cia/article-pdf/7/2/P16/56600/ciia-50568.pdf",""

They argue that the net effect of transparent packaging on food consumption is moderated by food characteristics (e.g., unit size, appearance). For small, visually attractive foods, the monitoring effect is low, so the salience effect dominates, and people eat more from a transparent package than from an opaque package. For large foods, the monitoring effect dominates the salience effect, decreasing consumption. For vegetables, which are primarily consumed for their health benefits, consumption monitoring is not activated, so the salience effect dominates, which ironically decreases consumption.

Mig-6, mainly known as a negative regulator of the EGF receptor, is an important mediator of progesterone signaling in the uterus, where it mediates tumor suppression by modulating endometrial stromal–epithelial communications. In this study, we investigated the function of Mig-6 in the uterine epithelium using a tissue-specific gene knockout strategy, in which floxed Mig-6 (Mig-6f/f) mice were crossed to Wnt7a-Cre mice (Wnt7acre+Mig-6f/f). Wnt7acre+Mig-6f/f mice developed endometrial hyperplasia and estrogen-dependent endometrial cancer, exhibiting increased proliferation in epithelial cells as well as apoptosis in subepithelial stromal cells. We documented increased expression of NOTCH1 and BIRC3 in epithelial cells of Wnt7acre+Mig-6f/f mice and decreased expression of the progesterone receptor (PR) in stromal cells. Progesterone therapy controls endometrial growth and prevents endometrial cancer, but the effectiveness of progesterone as a treatment for women with endometrial cancer is less clear. We noted that the hyperplasic phenotype of Wnt7acre+Mig-6f/f mice was prevented by progesterone treatment, whereas this treatment had no effect in PRcre/+Mig-6f/f mice where Mig-6 was deleted in both the epithelial and stromal compartments of the uterus. In contrast, activation of progesterone signaling in the stroma regulated proliferation and apoptosis in the epithelium via suppression of ERα signaling. In summary, our results establish that epithelial Mig-6 functions as a critical tumor suppressor that mediates the ability of progesterone to prevent the development of endometrial cancer.

In both 2D and 3D, at total surface areas < 50%, internal temperature is weakly sensitive to continental configuration. Mantle heat flux values show mild variations with changing configuration. In 3D, at total continental area > 50%, the dependence of mantle heat loss on continental configuration becomes stronger. Mantle temperature continues to increase with total continental area but now varies by 5%–7% with changing configurations. When distributed, continents can cause flow patterns to become locked. This leads to significant variations in mantle temperature below continental and oceanic regions. This differs from the expectation that supercontinents would preferentially lead to large lateral variations in mantle temperatures and suggests that insulation‐induced thermal anomalies could exist below continents today if they have remained fixed relative to mantle flow (e.g., Africa).","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/grl.50547",""

The primary focus of this paper is to evaluate the feasibility of using radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology as a means of gathering, verifying, and storing information for linear assets. The study investigates confluence factors that affect the performance of RFID. The factors investigated include driving speed and tag location on signposts, delineators, and guardrails.

Direct Hg analyzers, which use thermal decomposition and atomic absorption spectrometry, have recently gained popularity for determining organic Hg after procedural solvent extraction from some environmental media, although quantitative recovery from lipid‐rich materials, such as fish liver, has been problematic. The authors developed a new method by which organic Hg in fish liver and muscle is estimated by the difference between direct measurements of inorganic Hg in an acid extract and total Hg in whole tissue. The method was validated by analysis of a certified reference material (DOLT‐4 dogfish liver) and naturally contaminated fish tissues with comparison to an established Hg speciation method (gas chromatography cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry). Recovery of organic Hg from DOLT‐4, estimated by difference, averaged 99 ± 5% of the mean certified value for methylmercury. In most liver samples and all muscle samples, estimates of organic Hg from the proposed method were indiscernible from direct speciation measurements of methylmercury (99% ± 6%). Estimation of organic Hg by the difference between total Hg and inorganic Hg was less accurate in liver samples with a high percentage of inorganic Hg (90%). This was because of the increased uncertainty that results from estimating a third value (i.e., organic Hg) by using the difference between two large concentrations (inorganic and total Hg). The proposed method is a useful tool for examining the speciation of Hg in fish muscle and liver, and by extension, potentially other tissues and environmental media.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fetc.2184",""

The new methodology characterizes aging-switching activity and aging-supply voltage relationships that are applicable for minimizing power consumption and task execution efficiency in order to achieve low bit energy ratio (BER). In addition, a new dynamic management algorithm (DMA) is proposed to alleviate device degradation and to extend system lifespan. In contrast to traditional workload balancing schemes in which cores are regarded as homogeneous, the new algorithm ranks cores as “highly competitive,” “less competitive,” and “not competitive” according to their various competitiveness. Core competitiveness is evaluated based upon their reliability, temperature, and timing requirements. Consequently, “competitive” cores will take charge of the majority of the tasks at relatively high voltage/frequency without violating power and timing budgets, while “not competitive” cores will have light workloads to ensure their reliability. The new approach combines intrinsic device characteristics (aging-switching activity and aging-supply voltage curves) into an integrated framework to achieve high reliability and low energy level with graceful degradation of system performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method has achieved up to 20% power reduction, with about 4% performance degradation (in terms of accomplished workload and system throughput), compared with traditional workload balancing methods.

To improve this understanding, we conducted expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping in the Tsu-1 (Tsushima, Japan) × Kas-1 (Kashmir, India) recombinant inbred line population of Arabidopsis thaliana across soil drying treatments. We then used genome resequencing data to evaluate whether genomic features (promoter polymorphism, recombination rate, gene length, and gene density) are associated with genes responding to the environment (E) or with genes with genetic variation (G) in gene expression in the form of eQTLs. We identified thousands of genes that responded to soil drying and hundreds of main-effect eQTLs. However, we identified very few statistically significant eQTLs that interacted with the soil drying treatment (GxE eQTL). Analysis of genome resequencing data revealed associations of several genomic features with G and E genes. In general, E genes had lower promoter diversity and local recombination rates. By contrast, genes with eQTLs (G) had significantly greater promoter diversity and were located in genomic regions with higher recombination. These results suggest that genomic architecture may play an important a role in the evolution of gene expression.","http://academic.oup.com/plcell/article-pdf/25/9/3266/36953884/plcell_v25_9_3266.pdf",""

The sheathless nature of the interface minimizes dead volume which is particularly important for ultrafast CE because of the small diameters of the capillaries. METHODS: The separation voltage across the capillary was set to produce an electric field of ≥1000 V/cm to provide an analysis time of approximately 1 min. For the analysis of peptides and protein digests, a background electrolyte containing 0.1% cationic polymer (polybrene or Poly‐E) in 0.1% acetic acid in water was used to prevent analyte–wall interaction. RESULTS: Uniquely, the porous tip of the capillary is adjustable. This allows the porous tip to be pulled inside the sheath liquid for sample stacking during injection, or sample focusing in isoelectric focusing (IEF), or, alternatively, pushed outside of the sheath liquid for electrospray ionization (ESI). The adjustable interface preserves electrical conductivity during electrokinetic injection with reverse electro‐osmotic flow. Therefore, pre‐concentration of analytes at the capillary inlet is achieved without the need to disassemble the interface, improving the throughput. CONCLUSIONS: As a proof of concept, the application of UFCE‐MS was demonstrated by the analysis of a peptide mixture and a protein digest in ~1 min.

HTLV-1 viral genome-encoded oncoprotein, Tax, plays a pivotal role for promoting viral replication and initiating malignant transformation of CD4+ T lymphocytes. Tax deregulates various oncogenic signaling pathways including IκB kinase (IKK)/NF-κB, STAT3 and PI3K/Akt for aberrant proliferation of infected T cells. Tax activates IKK complex in the cytoplasm, resulting in persistent activation of NF-κB, a transcriptional factor that plays key roles in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation and cancer. The IKK complex can be activated by divergent upstream kinases that connect it to signals from cell surface receptors such as T cell receptor (TCR). Upon T cell activation, IKKs are recruited to the plasma membrane lipid raft microdomains where they become catalytically active. Lipid raft microdomains are detergent-resistant membrane structure enriched with cholesterol and sphingolipids and serve as crucial signal transduction platforms. Distinct from TCR activation, Tax bypasses upstream kinases to directly target IKKγ, thereby recruiting the IKK complex to the lipid raft microdomains for activation. The IKK complex has been implicated to play an important role in starvation- or rapamycin-induced autophagy, though the underlying mechanism is not yet determined. Autophagy is a catabolic process that involves degradation of unnecessary or dysfunctional cellular proteins and organelles through lysosomal machinery. In response to metabolic stress, autophagy process generates energy for the need of metabolically stressed cells, and hence, the primary function of autophagy is pro-survival. The autophagic process is regulated by a variety of oncogenic signaling pathways. Given the evidence that HTLV-1 mediates oncogenic activation, it is conceivable that HTLV-1 may deregulate autophagy for its own benefits in viral oncogenesis. We here report that Tax is the causative factor for induction of autophagy in HTLV-1-transformed T cells and Tax-immortalized CD4 memory T cells. Tax deregulates autophagy by activating the IκB kinase complex, which subsequently recruits the autophagy molecule complex containing Bif-1, Beclin 1 and PI3KC3 to the lipid raft microdomains. By connecting the IkB kinase complex to the autophagy molecule complex, Tax facilitates assembly of LC3+ autophagosomes. Expression of the lipid raft targeted Bif-1 or Beclin1 is sufficient to form LC3+ autophagosomes, indicating that Tax recruitment of the autophagic molecules to lipid rafts is the main strategy to deregulate autophagy. Further, depletion of Beclin 1, the key mediator of autophagy pathway, results in growth arrest of the leukemic cells. Together, our data suggest an essential role of Tax-mediated autophagy in promoting survival and malignant transformation of virally infected T cells.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/73/8_Supplement/1067/586595/Abstract-1067-HTLV-1-Tax-deregulates-autophagy-in",""

In particular, we find that CTP is a result of a sufficiently narrow monopole mode interacting with multipolar (including dipolar) modes. The screening arising from charge transfer induces a blueshift of the hybridized bonding dimer modes and decreases the electric field in the junction.

Two symptom clusters have been identified for this population. Little is known about the risk factors of these symptom clusters. METHODS: Subjects comprised 684 patients who were treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in a phase 3 randomized clinical trial. This trial compared standard fractionation radiotherapy to accelerated fractionation radiotherapy. Symptom clusters were evaluated at the end of the first and the second cycle of chemotherapy, and 3 months after the start of radiotherapy. Mixed‐effect modeling was used to observe risk factors for symptom clusters. RESULTS: Race and education were independent predictors for the head and neck cluster, whereas sex and history of tobacco use were independent predictors for the gastrointestinal cluster. Primary cancer site was only significant for the head and neck cluster when other factors were not controlled: patients with oropharyngeal cancer had more severe symptoms in the head and neck clusters than did patients with laryngeal cancer.

We demonstrate that whether a firm benefits from its power depends on the expected demand model but not on demand shock model. A firm benefits from its power only for linear but not for constant elasticity expected demand. The impact of power structure on supply chain efficiency depends on the models of both expected demand and demand shock. With additive shock, supply chain efficiency is highest (lowest) when neither firm dominates for linear (constant elasticity) expected demand. With multiplicative shock, the supply chain efficiency is highest with a power retailer (manufacturer) for linear (constant elasticity) expected demand. The manufacturer always benefits from a reduction in demand uncertainty. However, the retailer loses (benefits) from demand uncertainty reduction for linear (constant elasticity) expected demand. With a power retailer, the retail price is always on the higher end for linear expected demand, and the customer service level is the lowest for constant elasticity expected demand. Consequently, consumers do not necessarily benefit from a power retailer.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/poms.12002",""

Based on an international sample of firms from 40 countries, we observe evidence consistent with classification shifting in both strong and weak investor protection countries using four separate measures of investor protection. We then explore the potential monitoring role of financial analysts in mitigating classification shifting. We provide evidence that higher financial analyst following mitigates classification shifting, primarily in weak investor protection countries. Overall, our results provide evidence of classification shifting in a broad international setting and evidence of financial analysts' influence in reducing this form of earnings management.","https://publications.aaahq.org/jiar/article-pdf/12/2/27/74762/jiar-50439.pdf",""

We sought to determine whether TTA is associated with outcomes of FN. Procedure: A single‐center, retrospective cohort study was conducted of 1,628 FN admissions from 653 patients from 2001 to 2009. Outcome variables included (1) an adverse event (AE) composite of in‐hospital mortality, pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission within 24 hours of presentation, and/or fluid resuscitation ≥40 ml/kg within 24 hours of presentation and (2) length of stay (LOS). TTA was measured as a continuous variable and in 60‐minute intervals. Mixed regression models were constructed to evaluate associations of TTA with the outcome variables after adjusting for relevant covariates including cancer diagnosis, degree of myelosuppression, and presence of bacteremia. Results: The composite AE outcome occurred in 11.1% of admissions including 0.7% in‐hospital mortality, 4.7% PICU admission, and 10.1% fluid resuscitation. In univariate analysis, TTA was associated with the composite AE outcome (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.29, 95% CI 1.02–1.64) but not LOS. In multivariate analysis, after adjustment for relevant covariates, 60‐minute TTA intervals were associated with the composite AE outcome (61–120 minutes vs. ≤60 minutes, OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.01–3.26). Unexpectedly, admission from the emergency department (ED) was also independently associated with the composite AE outcome (ED vs. clinic, OR 3.15, 95% CI 1.95–5.09). Conclusions: TTA and presentation to the ED are independently associated with poor outcomes of FN.

Flow fields in the stable boundary layer, for instance, have characteristics such as enhanced wind speed and directional shear; these effects can influence loads on utility‐scale wind turbines. To investigate these influences, we use large‐eddy simulation (LES) to generate an extensive database of high‐resolution ( ∼ 10 m), four‐dimensional turbulent flow fields. Key atmospheric conditions (e.g., geostrophic wind) and surface conditions (e.g., aerodynamic roughness length) are systematically varied to generate a diverse range of physically realizable atmospheric stabilities. We show that turbine‐scale variables (e.g., hub height wind speed, standard deviation of the longitudinal wind speed, wind speed shear, wind directional shear and Richardson number) are strongly interrelated. Thus, we strongly advocate that these variables should not be prescribed as independent degrees of freedom in any synthetic turbulent inflow generator but rather that any turbulence generation procedure should be able to bring about realistic sets of such physically realizable sets of turbine‐scale flow variables. We demonstrate the utility of our LES‐generated database in estimation of loads on a 5‐MW wind turbine model. More importantly, we identify specific turbine‐scale flow variables that are responsible for large turbine loads—e.g., wind speed shear is found to have a greater influence on out‐of‐plane blade bending moments for the turbine studied compared with its influence on other loads such as the tower‐top yaw moment and the fore‐aft tower base moment.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fwe.1580",""

While thermal recovery is usually considered the most effective method for lowering viscosity, for some reservoirs introducing heat with commonly implemented thermal methods is not recommended. For these types of reservoirs, electromagnetic heating is the recommended solution. Electromagnetic heating targets part of the reservoir instead of heating the bulk of the reservoir, which means that the targeted area can be heated up more effectively and with lower heat losses than with other thermal methods. Electromagnetic heating is still relatively new and is not widely used as an alternate or addition to traditional thermal recovery methods. However, studies are being conducted and new technologies proposed that could help increase its use. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the recovery of heavy oil and bitumen reservoirs by electromagnetic heating through the review of existing laboratory studies and field trials.","http://downloads.hindawi.com/archive/2013/476519.pdf",""

Results: Results from a series of simultaneous mediational models indicated that the relations between risk factors and current suicidal ideation were partially mediated by total RFL (and Coping Beliefs and Self‐Evaluation subscales). Further, total RFL (and the Coping Beliefs subscale) fully mediated the relation between hopelessness and past‐year suicide attempt, and partially mediated the depressive symptoms‐suicide attempt relation.

Applying this model, the current study examined proximal and distal variables associated with positive and negative affect in oldest-old adults, investigating age differences. Methods.: Data from 306 octogenarians and centenarians who participated in Phase III of the Georgia Centenarian Study were used. Proximal variables included physical functioning, cognitive functioning, self-rated health, number of chronic conditions, social resources, and perceived economic status; distal variables included education, social productive activities, management of personal assets, and other learning experiences. Analysis of variance and block-wise regression analyses were conducted. Results.: Octogenarians showed significantly higher levels of positive emotion than centenarians. Cognitive functioning was significantly associated with positive affect, and number of health problems was significantly associated with negative affect after controlling for gender, ethnicity, residence, and marital status. Furthermore, four significant interaction effects suggested that positive affect significantly depended on the levels of cognitive and physical functioning among centenarians, whereas positive affect was dependent on the levels of physical health problems and learning experiences among octogenarians. Conclusion.: Findings of this study addressed the importance of current and past experiences and resources in subjective well-being among oldest-old adults as a life-long process.

Methods: A ventral median celiotomy was used to access the left or right kidney. To facilitate surgical exposure, the small intestine was reflected towards the diaphragm using laparotomy sponges and the ascending colon was exteriorized and in some cases evacuated. The peritoneum over the affected kidney was incised and blunt dissection used to free the kidney from the retroperitoneal fat, then the renal artery, vein, and ureter were isolated and ligated. Abdominal lavage with sterile saline solution was performed before abdominal closure. Results: Four horses, 1 donkey, and 1 mule had unilateral nephrectomy to treat verminous nephritis (1), idiopathic hematuria (1), and ectopic ureter (4).

The primary objectives of this article are to highlight the challenges in the estimation of the model components, to compare two approximations to the logistic regression function, linear and exponential, and to discuss their advantages and limitations. The linear approximation is computationally efficient whereas the exponential approximation applies for rare events functional data. Our methods are inspired by and applied to a scientific experiment on spectral backscatter from long range infrared light detection and ranging (LIDAR) data. The models are general and relevant to many new binary functional data sets, with or without dependence between repeated functional measurements.","https://academic.oup.com/biometrics/article-pdf/69/4/903/55047693/biometrics_69_4_903.pdf",""

Thus, we utilized a mass spectrometry-based lipidomic approach, focused towards the sphingolipid class of lipids, to quantify changes in human pancreatic cancer tumor and plasma specimens. Subgroup analysis revealed that patients with positive lymph node metastasis have a markedly higher level of ceramide species (C16:0 and C24:1) in their tumor specimens compared to pancreatic cancer patients without nodal disease or to patients with pancreatitis. Also of interest, ceramide metabolites, including phosphorylated (sphingosine- and sphinganine-1-phosphate) and glycosylated (cerebroside) species were elevated in the plasma, but not the pancreas, of pancreatic cancer patients with nodal disease. Analysis of plasma level of cytokine and growth factors revealed that IL-6, IL-8, CCL11 (eotaxin), EGF and IP10 (interferon inducible protein 10, CXCL10) were elevated in patients with positive lymph nodes metastasis, but that only IP10 and EGF directly correlated with several sphingolipid changes.

The balance of forces responsible for net capillary filtration and lymph formation is described by the Starling equation, but additional factors such as vascular and interstitial compliance, which vary markedly among vertebrates, also have a significant impact on rates of lymph formation. Why vertebrates show extreme variability in rates of lymph formation and how nonmammalian vertebrates maintain plasma volume homeostasis is unclear. This gap hampers our understanding of the evolution of the lymphatic system and its interaction with the cardiovascular system. The evolutionary origin of the vertebrate lymphatic system is not clear, but recent advances suggest common developmental factors for lymphangiogenesis in teleost fishes, amphibians, and mammals with some significant changes in the water-land transition. The lymphatic system of anuran amphibians is characterized by large lymphatic sacs and two pairs of lymph hearts that return lymph into the venous circulation but no lymph vessels per se. The lymphatic systems of reptiles and some birds have lymph hearts, and both groups have extensive lymph vessels, but their functional role in both lymph movement and plasma volume homeostasis is almost completely unknown. The purpose of this review is to present an evolutionary perspective in how different vertebrates have solved the common problem of the inevitable formation of lymph from their closed circulatory systems and to point out the many gaps in our knowledge of this evolutionary progression.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/japplphysiol.00201.2013",""

Previous studies indicate that the maxillary sinuses may play a key role in accommodating climatically induced nasal variation such that a decrease in nasal cavity volume is associated with a concomitant increase in maxillary sinus volume. However, due to conflicting results in previous studies, the precise interaction of the nasal cavity and maxillary sinuses, in humans, is unclear. This is likely due to the prior emphasis on nasal cavity size, whereas arguably, nasal cavity shape is more important with regard to the interaction with the maxillary sinuses. Using computed tomography scans of living human subjects (N=40), the goal of this study is to assess the interaction between nasal cavity form and maxillary sinus volume in European‐ and African‐derived individuals with differences in nasal cavity morphology. First, we assessed whether there is an inverse relationship between nasal cavity and maxillary sinus volumes. Next, we examined the relationship between maxillary sinus volume and nasal cavity shape using multivariate regression. Our results show that there is a positive relationship between nasal cavity and maxillary sinus volume, indicating that the maxillary sinuses do not accommodate variation in nasal cavity size. However, maxillary sinus volume is significantly correlated with variation in relative internal nasal breadth. Thus, the maxillary sinuses appear to be important for accommodating nasal cavity shape rather than size.

[Science 319, 183 (2008)]10.1126/science.1150238, ion imaging experiments were used to study the Cl− + CH3I → ClCH3 + I− reaction at collision energies Erel of 0.39, 0.76, 1.07, and 1.9 eV. For the work reported here MP2(fc)/ECP/d direct dynamics simulations were performed to obtain an atomistic understanding of the experiments. There is good agreement with the experimental product energy and scattering angle distributions for the highest three Erel, and at these energies 80% or more of the reaction is direct, primarily occurring by a rebound mechanism with backward scattering. At 0.76 eV there is a small indirect component, with isotropic scattering, involving formation of the pre- and post-reaction complexes. All of the reaction is direct at 1.07 eV. Increasing Erel to 1.9 eV opens up a new indirect pathway, the roundabout mechanism. The product energy is primarily partitioned into relative translation for the direct reactions, but to CH3Cl internal energy for the indirect reactions. The roundabout mechanism transfers substantial energy to CH3Cl rotation. At Erel = 0.39 eV both the experimental product energy partitioning and scattering are statistical, suggesting the reaction is primarily indirect with formation of the pre- and post-reaction complexes. However, neither MP2 nor BhandH/ECP/d simulations agree with experiment and, instead, give reaction dominated by direct processes as found for the higher collision energies. Decreasing the simulation Erel to 0.20 eV results in product energy partitioning and scattering which agree with the 0.39 eV experiment. The sharp transition from a dominant direct to indirect reaction as Erel is lowered from 0.39 to 0.20 eV is striking. The lack of agreement between the simulations and experiment for Erel = 0.39 eV may result from a distribution of collision energies in the experiment and/or a shortcoming in both the MP2 and BhandH simulations. Increasing the reactant rotational temperature from 75 to 300 K for the 1.9 eV collisions, results in more rotational energy in the CH3Cl product and a larger fraction of roundabout trajectories. Even though a ClCH3–I− post-reaction complex is not formed and the mechanistic dynamics are not statistical, the roundabout mechanism gives product energy partitioning in approximate agreement with phase space theory.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.4795495/13317986/114309_1_online.pdf",""

With a random probability of remaining a going concern, the stock price is lognormal as in the Black–Scholes model. The bankruptcy probability is correlated with aggregated wealth if the bankruptcy risk is systematic. The model is consistent with a bankruptcy probability negatively correlated with the firm's stock price. If the bankruptcy probability of a given firm increases then its stock price decreases which leads to the value of the call options written on that stock to decrease.

In this aerosol process, nanoparticle precursors are injected into a high‐temperature flame that causes precursor oxidation, nucleation, and subsequent growth of solid particles through a variety of processes. To aid computational design of the aerosol process, a large‐eddy simulation (LES) based computational framework is developed here. A flamelet‐based model is used to describe both combustion and precursor oxidation. The solid phase nanoparticle evolution is described using a bivariate number density function (NDF) approach. The high‐dimensional NDF transport equation is solved using a novel conditional quadrature method of moments (CQMOM) approach. Particle phase processes such as collision‐based aggregation, and temperature‐induced sintering are included in this description. This LES framework is used to study an experimental methane/air flame that used titanium tetrachloride to generate titania particles. The simulation results show that the evolution process of titania nanoparticles is largely determined by the competition between particle aggregation and sintering at downstream locations in the reactor. It is shown that the bivariate description improves the prediction of particle size characteristics, although the large uncertainty in inflow and operating conditions prevent a full scale validation. © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/aic.14279",""

Contamination events are sociotechnical systems, in which the interactions among consumers and water infrastructure may generate unpredicted public health consequences. This research develops a sociotechnical risk assessment framework that simulates the dynamics of a contamination event by coupling an agent-based modeling (ABM) framework with Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), genetic algorithm (GA) optimization, and a multi-objective GA. The ABM framework couples WDS simulation with agents to represent consumers in a virtual city. MCS is applied to estimate the uncertainty in human exposure, based on probabilistic models of event attributes. A GA approach is used to identify critical contamination events by maximizing risk, and a multi-objective approach explores the trade-off between consequence and occurrence probabilities. Results that are obtained using the sociotechnical approach are compared with results obtained using a conventional engineering model. The sociotechnical approach removes assumptions that have been used in engineering analysis about the static, homogeneous, and stationary behaviors of consumers, and results demonstrate new insight about the impacts of these actions and interactions on the public health consequences of contamination events.","http://iwaponline.com/jh/article-pdf/16/3/531/387258/531.pdf",""

Here we conduct simulations of characters containing phylogenetic signal to explore the performance of DFA under a variety of conditions. Characters were simulated using a phylogeny of extant antelope species from known habitats. Characters were modeled with no biomechanical relationship to the habitat category; the only sources of variation were body mass, phylogenetic signal, or random “noise.” DFA on the discriminability of habitat categories was performed using subsets of the simulated characters, and Phylogenetic Generalized Least Squares (PGLS) was performed for each character. Analyses were repeated with randomized habitat assignments. When simulated characters lacked phylogenetic signal and/or habitat assignments were random, <5.6% of DFAs and <8.26% of PGLS analyses were significant. When characters contained phylogenetic signal and actual habitats were used, 33.27 to 45.07% of DFAs and <13.09% of PGLS analyses were significant. False Discovery Rate (FDR) corrections for multiple PGLS analyses reduced the rate of significance to <4.64%. In all cases using actual habitats and characters with phylogenetic signal, correct classification rates of DFAs exceeded random chance. In simulations involving phylogenetic signal in both predictor variables and predicted categories, PGLS with FDR was rarely significant, while DFA often was. In short, DFA offered no indication that differences between categories might be explained by phylogenetic signal, while PGLS did. As such, PGLS provides a valuable tool for testing the functional hypotheses at the heart of ecomorphology.

In addition to several other mechanisms, the beneficial effect of preischemic exercise following stroke is due to an upregulated capacity to maintain energy supplies. Adult male Sprague‐Dawley rats were used in exercise and control groups. After 1–3 weeks of exercise, several enzymes were analyzed as a gauge of the direct effect of physical exercise on cerebral metabolism. As a measure of metabolic capacity, an ADP/ATP ratio was obtained. Glucose transporters (GLUT1 and GLUT3) were monitored to assess glucose influx, and phosphofructokinase (PFK) was measured to determine the rate of glycolysis. Hypoxia‐induced factor‐1α (HIF‐1α) and 5′AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) levels were also determined. These same analyses were performed on preconditioned and control rats following an ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) insult. Our results show that GLUT1, GLUT3, PFK, AMPK, and HIF‐1α were all increased following 3 weeks of exercise training. In addition, the ADP/ATP ratio was chronically elevated during these 3 weeks. After I/R injury, HIF‐1α and AMPK were significantly higher in exercised rats. The ADP/ATP ratio was reduced in preconditioned rats in the acute phase after stroke, suggesting a lower level of metabolic disorder. GLUT1 and GLUT3 were also increased in the acute phase in exercise rats, indicating that these rats were better able to increase rates of metabolism immediately after ischemic injury. In addition, PFK expression was increased in exercise rats showing an enhanced glycolysis resulting from exercise preconditioning. Altogether, exercise preconditioning increased the rates of glucose metabolism, allowing a more rapid and more substantial increase in ATP production following stroke. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fjnr.23203",""

Patterns identified across studies were illustrated in a model representing the process of knowing the patient, including factors of the nurse's internal environment, information practices to develop knowledge and create meaning, and the nurse's response. The process of knowing the patient occurs within the context of relationship with the patient and in an environment that is temporal in nature. Conclusions: While knowing the patient continues to be a prominent concept in the nursing literature, practice environments may not provide the conditions necessary to support the process, particularly temporal factors of time availability, sustained contact, continuity, and consistency. Clinical Relevance: Findings inform the development of professional practice models that support knowing the patient.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fjnu.12049",""

This case report details the addiction to tramadol of a 39-year-old female serving in the United States Army. At the height of her addiction, she was consuming an average of 1400mg tramadol daily. Eventually the patient entered into residential inpatient treatment for 28 days at our facility. During this time she was successfully titrated to buprenorphine 8mg/naloxone 2mg daily while maintaining abstinence. Patient care transitioned to the outpatient treatment center during which she maintained sobriety with the continued use of buprenorphine/naloxone.

Bivariate correlations were examined and factor analytic methods were used to examine the degree to which the DSM-5 traits and PAI capture common variance in personality and mental health. In a student sample ( N = 1,001), we found broad convergence between the DSM-5 traits and PAI, which could be organized effectively using five factors.

The primary hypothesis is that unfavorable household economic conditions resulting from changes in household demographic composition increase the risk of death for children under the age of 5 years because of limited resources and intra‐household competition. We apply Cox proportional hazards models to nearly 5,000 linked birth and death records from the Northern Orkney Islands, Scotland, from the period 1855 to 2001. The dependent variable is the child's risk of death before age 5. Findings suggest that children in households with unfavorable age compositions face higher risk of death. This elevated risk of death continues once heterogeneity among children, islands, and households is controlled. Results also show differential risk of death for male children, children of higher birth orders, and twin births. The analyses present evidence for intra‐household competition in this historic setting.

We recorded by-catch of fishes at a recreational fishery in Northeast Texas, statistically analyzed them, and then projected estimates of mortality if our observations represent a general pattern of behavior. Anglers discarded nine species of fishes during our study. The most frequently discarded fish were Gizzard Shad and Freshwater Drum. Four species of game fish were among the discarded species, but only Channel Catfish and Hybrid Striped Bass composed a large portion of the discarded fishes. Based on our observations, recreational fishing can produce a large amount of by-catch throughout the year and potentially pose an important unmonitored source of fish mortality.","https://peerj.com/preprints/120v1.pdf",""

Recent research in causal inference for statistical mediation has focused on addressing the sequential ignorability assumption; specifically, that there is no confounding between the mediator and the outcome variable. Objectives:: This article compares and contrasts three different methods for assessing sensitivity to confounding and describes the graphical depiction of these methods. Design:: Two types of data were used to fully examine the plots for sensitivity analysis. The first type was generated data from a single mediator model with a confounder influencing both the mediator and the outcome variable. The second was data from an actual intervention study. With both types of data, situations are examined where confounding has a large effect and a small effect. Subjects:: The nonsimulated data were from a large intervention study to decrease intentions to use steroids among high school football players. We demonstrate one situation where confounding is likely and another situation where confounding is unlikely. Conclusions:: We discuss how these methods could be implemented in future mediation studies as well as the limitations and future directions for these methods.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0193841X14524576",""

Large scale, finite amplitude vortex structures are launched as initial conditions at low, mid, and high latitudes. For each k-vector the linear dispersion relation has two eigenmodes corresponding to the slow magnetized Rossby wave and the fast magnetic Khantadze wave. Both waves propagate westward with local speeds of the order of 10–20 m/s for the slow wave and of the order of 500–1000 km/s for the fast wave. We show that for finite amplitudes there are dipole solitary structures emitted from the initial conditions. These structures are neutrally stable, nonlinear states that avoid radiating waves by propagating faster than the corresponding linear wave speeds. The condition for these coherent structures to occur is that their amplitudes are such that the nonlinear convection around the core of the disturbance is faster than the linear wave speed for the corresponding dominant Fourier components of the initial disturbance. The presence of the solitary vortex states is indicative of an initial strong disturbance such as that from a solar storm or a tectonic plate movement. We show that for generic, large amplitude initial disturbances both slow and fast vortex structures propagate out of the initial structure.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pop/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.4826592/15683878/102903_1_online.pdf",""

Results from the 2009 study were updated to reflect current ridership and ticket revenue data, as well as findings from passenger surveys conducted in spring 2011. Considering individual traveler savings, passenger spending at local businesses, and Amtrak-related expenditures, Amtrak service generated an estimated economic impact to the state of Michigan in excess of $45.8 million in 2011. The average economic impact (excluding Amtrak expenditures) was $37.87 per passenger. Every $1.00 invested by the state of Michigan for operations of the Blue Water and Pere Marquette routes returned $1.84 in economic impact to local communities and travelers along these routes. The findings of this analysis contribute to a small but growing body of literature that quantifies the economic impacts of existing Amtrak passenger rail service and have several applications for passenger rail planning, policy development, and outreach activities.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/2374-03",""

Density, viscosity, and thermal conductivity of the gaseous phase are assumed to be small compared with those of the liquid phase, and a one-sided model is applied. A system of nonlinear equations is obtained using the long-wave approximation and the assumption of a slow time evolution. These equations incorporate basic physical effects which take place in the system. Linear stability analysis of the base state is performed for long-wave disturbances in the framework of the frozen interface approximation. The cases of quasi-equilibrium evaporation (when the interfacial temperature equals the equilibrium one) and nonequilibrium evaporation are considered.

While this was indeed the case when L‐FABP null (−/−) mice on the C57BL/6NCr background were pair‐fed a high‐fat diet, whether this would also be observed under high‐fat diet fed ad libitum was not known. Therefore, this possibility was examined in female L‐FABP (−/−) mice on the same background. L‐FABP (−/−) mice consumed equal amounts of defined high‐fat or isocaloric control diets fed ad libitum. However, on the ad libitum‐fed high‐fat diet the L‐FABP (−/−) mice exhibited: (1) decreased hepatic long chain fatty acid (LCFA) β‐oxidation as indicated by lower serum β‐hydroxybutyrate level; (2) decreased hepatic protein levels of key enzymes mitochondrial (rate limiting carnitine palmitoyl acyltransferase A1, CPT1A; HMG‐CoA synthase) and peroxisomal (acyl CoA oxidase 1, ACOX1) LCFA β‐oxidation; (3) increased fat tissue mass (FTM) and FTM/energy intake to the greatest extent; and (4) exacerbated body weight gain, weight gain/energy intake, liver weight, and liver weight/body weight to the greatest extent. Taken together, these findings showed that L‐FABP gene‐ablation exacerbated diet‐induced weight gain and fat tissue mass gain in mice fed high‐fat diet ad libitum—consistent with the known biochemistry and cell biology of L‐FABP.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1007/s11745-013-3777-3",""

To reduce costs, many health care systems have restricted the availability of SGAs through use of prior authorizations. Restrictions for the off-label use of SGAs and the use of dual-antipsychotic therapy have also been implemented in many health care systems. At the South Texas Veterans Health Care System (STVHCS), a restricted drug request (RDR) method has been implemented to manage costs and improve patient safety. Risperidone, due to its lower cost and equal efficacy, is the first-line option of SGAs. If one wishes to prescribe an SGA other than risperidone, an RDR is submitted and reviewed by Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) pharmacists. Since the introduction of these policies at the STVHCS, the impact of the RDR has not been assessed.","http://meridian.allenpress.com/mhc/article-pdf/3/1/13/2096627/mhc_n161245.pdf",""

The learner-centered technique of summarizing the history and findings, narrowing the differential, analyzing the differential, probing the instructor about uncertainties, plan management, and selecting an issue for self-directed study (SNAPPS) is used in medicine to express clinical reasoning. Objective:: To investigate the effects of SNAPPS on the clinical reasoning, reflection, and 4 case presentation attributes (length, conciseness, case summary, and expression of clinical reasoning) in athletic training students. Design:: Randomized controlled clinical trial. Setting:: Three undergraduate programs accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education. Patients or Other Participants:: We randomly assigned 38 athletic training students (17 men, 21 women; age = 21.53 ± 1.18 years, grade point average = 3.25 ± 0.31) who had completed at least 1 year of clinical education and all orthopaedic evaluation coursework to the SNAPPS group or the usual and customary group using a stratification scheme. Intervention(s):: The SNAPPS group completed four 45-minute clinical reasoning and case presentation learning modules led by an investigator to learn the SNAPPS technique, whereas the usual and customary group received no formal instruction. Both groups audio recorded all injury evaluations performed over a 2-week period. Main Outcome Measures:: Participants completed the Diagnostic Thinking Inventory and Reflection in Learning Scale twice. Case presentations were analyzed for 4 attributes: length, conciseness, case summary, and expression of clinical reasoning. Results:: Case presentations were longer (t18.806 = −5.862, P &lt; .001) but were more concise (t32 = 11.297, P &lt; .001) for the SNAPPS group than for the usual and customary group. The SNAPPS group performed better on both the case summary subscale (t32 = 2.857, P = .007) and the clinical reasoning subscale (t25.773 = −14.162, P &lt; .001) than the other group. We found a time effect for Diagnostic Thinking Inventory scores (F1,34 = 6.230, P = .02) but observed no group effects (F1,34 = 0.698, P = .41) or time-by-group interaction (F1,34 = 1.050, P = .31). The Reflection in Learning Scale scores analysis revealed no group-by-time interaction (F1,34 = 1.470, P = .23) and no group (F1,34 = 3.751, P = .06) or time (F1,34 = 0.835, P = .37) effects. Conclusions:: The SNAPPS is an effective and feasible clinical education technique for case presentations. This learner-centered technique provides the opportunity for the expression of clinical reasoning skills.","http://meridian.allenpress.com/jat/article-pdf/48/3/362/1609063/1062-6050-48_2_17.pdf",""

These two genomes were derived from progenitor A-genome and D-genome diploids involved in ancestral allopolyploidization. To better understand the allopolyploid genome, we re-sequenced the genomes of extant diploid relatives that contain the A1 (Gossypium herbaceum), A2 (Gossypium arboreum), or D5 (Gossypium raimondii) genomes. We conducted a comparative analysis using deep re-sequencing of multiple accessions of each diploid species and identified 24 million SNPs between the A-diploid and D-diploid genomes. These analyses facilitated the construction of a robust index of conserved SNPs between the A-genomes and D-genomes at all detected polymorphic loci. This index is widely applicable for read mapping efforts of other diploid and allopolyploid Gossypium accessions. Further analysis also revealed locations of putative duplications and deletions in the A-genome relative to the D-genome reference sequence. The approximately 25,400 deleted regions included more than 50% deletion of 978 genes, including many involved with starch synthesis. In the polyploid genome, we also detected 1,472 conversion events between homoeologous chromosomes, including events that overlapped 113 genes. Continued characterization of the Gossypium genomes will further enhance our ability to manipulate fiber and agronomic production of cotton.","http://academic.oup.com/g3journal/article-pdf/3/10/1809/37143260/g3journal1809.pdf",""

Few population‐based studies have been published on prenatal detection for structural birth defects in the United States. The aim of this study is to determine the frequency of maternal reporting of abnormal prenatal ultrasounds for selected birth defects and to investigate associated maternal characteristics. Methods: Participants included 4013 mothers enrolled in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study who carried a fetus with at least one of 14 structural birth defects between 1997 and 2004. Frequencies of abnormal prenatal ultrasounds were based on maternal report and computed for isolated and multiple defects. Associations between maternal characteristics and abnormal prenatal ultrasounds were assessed using logistic regression. Results: Overall, 46% of participants reported an abnormal ultrasound. Infants with omphalocele, anencephaly, gastroschisis, and renal agenesis were more likely to have abnormal prenatal ultrasounds than those with cleft and limb abnormalities. Hispanic women were less likely to report abnormal prenatal ultrasounds of birth defects than Caucasians, as were women who had a body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m CONCLUSION: Of the 14 selected birth defects in this study, less than half were reported by mothers of affected infants to have had an abnormal ultrasound during pregnancy.

We then adopt a Bayesian approach for the estimation of the model parameters. Our inferential procedure uses exact wavelet coefficients variances and leads to accurate estimates of the model parameters. We explore performances on simulated data and present an application to an fMRI data set.

This is of some importance since ADRP's affinity for lipids and especially FA may be related to lipid droplet formation, triacylglycerol accumulation, and FA uptake and metabolism in the cell. The purpose of the present investigation was to characterize ADRP and several truncated mutants using fluorescence binding assays and circular dichroism (CD) to assess the structural requirements for binding. Results presented here show that removal of 120 amino acids from the N‐terminus, a high homology region common to other lipid droplet proteins increased the FA binding affinity (Kd) 43%. In contrast, deleting 254 residues decreased the Kd 24%. Removal of 173 amino acids from the C‐terminus, however did not significantly change the protein's ability to bind FA. Conformational changes upon binding were confirmed by CD. Taken together, these results indicate that residues 121–254 appear essential for highest affinity binding and show that the ability of ADRP to bind FA may depend on the proper folding of several domains, the partial deletion of which leads to altered, but not ablated ligand binding.

An implicit assumption in the literature is that more accurate analyst forecasts (i.e., estimates that are closer to the reported earnings) are better for investors, and that analysts' objective is to forecast the reported (managed) earnings accurately. Our analysis suggests that this is not necessarily the case and that an inaccurate forecast can actually be more informative than an accurate one.

These studies implicitly assume that analysts side with management against the interests of their clients.

A variety of peripheral and integral membrane proteins that facilitate membrane curvature generation, fission, and/or fusion have been identified over the past two decades.

Main Outcome Measure(s):: Self-reported symptoms, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures (BPs), and the Borg rating of perceived exertion were measured before, during each minute of, and immediately after a graded treadmill exercise test (Balke protocol). Exercise was stopped when participants could no longer maintain the effort or reported the onset of or increase in PCS symptoms. Results:: Exercise test duration (8.5 ± 4.4 minutes versus 17.9 ± 3.6 minutes; t51 = 1.8, P &lt; .001), heart rate (142.8 ± 24.1 versus 175.2 ± 17.4; t54 = −5.5, P &lt; .001), and systolic BP (142.1 ± 18.3 mm Hg versus 155.5 ± 24.5 mm Hg; t53 = 2.3, P = .02) were lower, and diastolic BP (78.4 ± 10.2 mm Hg versus 73.5 ± 11.7 mm Hg; t53 = 2.2, P = .03) was higher at test cessation in the PCS than control group. Cox regression showed the odds of a shorter exercise duration were nearly 8 times greater in the PCS than control group (hazard ratio = 7.93; 95% confidence interval = 3.39, 18.56). In the general linear models that adjusted for differences in test duration, rating of perceived exertion was the only physiologic measure to show an overall difference between groups, with the control group reporting higher ratings than the PCS group (t53 = −6.0, P &lt; .001). Within the PCS group, systolic BP was the only measure to show a sex effect, with males showing higher pressure readings than females throughout the exercise tests (t31 = 2.8, P = .009). Conclusions:: Patients with PCS had a symptom-limited response to exercise, and the treadmill test was a potentially useful tool to monitor the recovery from PCS.","http://meridian.allenpress.com/jat/article-pdf/48/5/627/1609719/1062-6050-48_5_02.pdf",""

The bond-to-ring cycloaddition is found to be energetically most stable among various configurations and the minimum energy paths of different-sized fullerenes attaching to graphene indicate that smaller fullerene shows lower energy barriers due to its larger surface curvature. For perfectly ordered adsorption, band structures analyses by both density functional theory (DFT) and tight binding (TB) methods show that the Dirac cone of graphene can be generally preserved despite the sp2 to sp3 bond hybridization change for selected carbon atoms in graphene sheet. However, the position of the Dirac points inside the Brillouin zone has a shift from the hexagonal corner and can be effectively modulated by changing the fullerenes’ concentration. For practical applications, we show that a considerable band gap (∼0.35 eV) can be opened by inducing randomness in the orientation of the fullerene adsorption and an effective order parameter is identified that correlates well with the magnitude of the band gap opening.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/adv/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.4807738/12869225/052126_1_online.pdf",""

The expression of NANOGP8 has been documented in several cancers and is related to cell proliferation and tumor development. However, the regulation of NANOGP8 expression has not been investigated. Therefore, the role of NANOGP8 in cell proliferation has not been completely understood. METHODS: We evaluate the expression of NANOG1 and NANOGP8 in prostate cancer cell lines and primary cultures of prostate tissues. We investigate clonogenicity, sphere formation, and xenograft tumor growth of prostate cancer cells with an activated 5′flanking region of NANOGP8. We examine the role of NANOGP8 in cell cycle progression. RESULTS: In the prostate cells the NANOG RNA was transcribed from NANOGP8 and not from NANOG1. Cells with the activated 5′flanking region of NANOGP8 exhibited enhanced clonogenicity, sphere formation, and xenograft tumor growth. The sphere culture and tumor initiation mouse mode promoted the activation of the 5′flanking region of NANOGP8. Forced expression of NANOGP8 increased the entry into the cell cycle. DISCUSSION: In prostate cells NANOGP8 is a predominant molecule of NANOG. The activation of 5′flanking sequence of NANOGP8 could play a role in the regulation of the stem‐like properties of cancer stem cells and prostate tumor initiation and development. The microenvironment favoring cancer stem cells could promote the activation of the 5′flanking region of NANOGP8.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fpros.22759",""

The higher the dispersion, the more inconsistent and polarized the brands’ cross-consumer ratings. Multiple analyses on 730,818 brand–day observations provide robust evidence that brand dispersion fluctuations affect stock prices. Brand dispersion has Januslike effects: it harms returns but reduces firm risk. Furthermore, downside dispersion has a stronger impact on abnormal returns than upside dispersion, indicating an asymmetry in brand dispersion's effects. Moreover, dispersion tempers the risk-reduction benefits of higher brand rating in both the short run and long run. Without modeling dispersion, brand rating's impact on firm value can be over- or underestimated.

With the passage of time, transit fleets get older and require maintenance costs to keep them operational. To provide services at a desired level, transit agencies must maintain a minimum fleet size. Two imperative considerations from the transit planning viewpoint are (a) the remaining life of the total fleet and (b) the cost required to maintain the fleet size. While the former is a quality measure indicating the health of the fleet, the latter is an economic measure requiring minimum expenditure levels. Ideally, agencies would like to maximize the total remaining life of the fleet and minimize the total cost required to maintain the fleet size. In this paper, a multiobjective optimization (MO) model is proposed to incorporate simultaneously the two objectives when subjected to budget and various operational constraints. The MO problem is solved with a classical weight sum approach by using the branch and bound algorithm, which has proved to be better than other solution methodologies. The MO results in Pareto-optimal solutions with possible trade-offs between the two objectives. The model is applied to a large-scale transit fleet system in the state of Michigan. The case study results demonstrate that the proposed model is compact, efficient, robust, and suitable for long-range planning with multiple solutions to choose from a Pareto-optimal frontier. The correlation between decision variables and objective functions has been investigated in-depth, providing important insights. The proposed model can act as a tool for resource allocation for state and local agency transit fleets.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/2351-01",""

The main scope is to discuss and reduce the risk of model over-fitting. Over-fitting of a classification model occurs when too many and/or irrelevant model terms are included (i.e., a large number of spectral bands), and it may lead to low robustness/repeatability when the classification model is applied to independent validation data. We outline a simple way to quantify the level of model over-fitting by comparing the observed classification accuracies with those obtained from explanatory random data. Hyperspectral imaging data were acquired from two crop–insect pest systems: (1) potato psyllid ( Bactericera cockerelli) infestations of individual bell pepper plants ( Capsicum annuum) with the acquisition of hyperspectral imaging data under controlled-light conditions (data set 1), and (2) sugarcane borer ( Diatraea saccharalis) infestations of individual maize plants ( Zea mays) with the acquisition of hyperspectral imaging data from the same plants under two markedly different image-acquisition conditions (data sets 2a and b). For each data set, reflectance data were analyzed based on seven spectral resolutions by dividing 160 spectral bands from 405 to 907 nm into 4, 16, 32, 40, 53, 80, or 160 bands. In the two data sets, similar classification results were obtained with spectral resolutions ranging from 3.1 to 12.6 nm. Thus, the size of the initial input data could be reduced fourfold with only a negligible loss of classification accuracy. In the analysis of data set 1, several validation approaches all demonstrated consistently that insect-induced stress could be accurately detected and that therefore there was little indication of model over-fitting. In the analyses of data set 2, inconsistent validation results were obtained and the observed classification accuracy (81.06%) was only a few percentage points above that obtained using random data (66.7–77.4%). Thus, our analysis highlights a potential risk of model over-fitting and emphasizes the importance of testing for this important aspect as part of developing reliable and robust classification models.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1366/12-06933",""

Exposure to 2‐amino‐1‐methyl‐6‐phenylimidazo[4,5‐b]pyridine (PhIP), the cooked meat heterocyclic amine, results in binding to ER alpha and cancer. Our hypothesis is the estrogenic effects of PhIP are responsible for carcinogenicity and blocking ERα via toremifene would prevent the effects of PhIP. We provided PhIP (70mg/kg) with or without toremifene (~8.6 mg/kg) in AIN93G diets to male Fischer rats for 20 weeks and then AIN93G diet for 32 weeks before collecting prostates, seminal vesicles, testes, skin, and intestines. Toremifene + PhIP rats consumed 37% less calories than PhIP rats thus a 37% dietary restricted (DR) + PhIP group was used as a control. Decreases in prostate and seminal vesicle weights, histological changes, and lack of mature sperm in the testes’ tubules were seen with toremifene. Ventral prostates showed decreased androgen receptor levels with toremifene, while testes showed no positivity. CK5 increased with toremifene, whereas PhIP had the opposite effect. PhIP rats had the greatest incidences of skin, intestinal, and prostate carcinomas. While some reductions were seen with DR the greatest effects were in rats given toremifene. We conclude that in the rat toremifene has marked anti‐androgenic and anticancer effects.","",""

The authors evaluate the models for a set of basic surface climate and hydrological variables and their extremes for the continent. This is supplemented by evaluations for selected regional climate processes relevant to North American climate, including cool season western Atlantic cyclones, the North American monsoon, the U.S. Great Plains low-level jet, and Arctic sea ice. In general, the multimodel ensemble mean represents the observed spatial patterns of basic climate and hydrological variables but with large variability across models and regions in the magnitude and sign of errors. No single model stands out as being particularly better or worse across all analyses, although some models consistently outperform the others for certain variables across most regions and seasons and higher-resolution models tend to perform better for regional processes. The CMIP5 multimodel ensemble shows a slight improvement relative to CMIP3 models in representing basic climate variables, in terms of the mean and spread, although performance has decreased for some models. Improvements in CMIP5 model performance are noticeable for some regional climate processes analyzed, such as the timing of the North American monsoon. The results of this paper have implications for the robustness of future projections of climate and its associated impacts, which are examined in the third part of the paper.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00592.1",""

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to any vessel was performed with similar frequency in patients with and without CTO (50% vs. 53%). CTO PCI was performed in 30% of patients without and 15% of patients with prior CABG with high technical (82 and 75%, respectively) and procedural success rates (80 and 73%, respectively). In a contemporary veteran population, coronary CTOs are highly prevalent and are associated with more extensive co‐morbidities and higher likelihood for CABG referral. PCI was equally likely to be performed in patients with and without CTO. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fccd.25264",""

The technique combines door counts and intercept surveys to classify trips by mode, and it has several advantages over existing methods that use automated technologies to count automobiles entering and exiting access points to developments. These advantages are particularly important in urban areas with mixed-use developments, mixed-use buildings, and a variety of parking arrangements. First, door counts quantify the total number of trips generated by all modes. Second, door counts quantify all people traveling to and from particular land uses, even if a targeted use is part of a larger, mixed-use building. Third, intercept surveys differentiate between people who are walking for an entire trip and people who are walking as a secondary mode to or from parking or transit. The method was applied at 30 smart-growth study locations in California. Multimodal person trips and vehicle trips were documented at 24 of the study locations during the morning peak hour and at 27 study locations during the afternoon peak hour. Weighted averages from these locations show that suburban-based ITE peak hour vehicle trip estimates were 2.3 times higher than actual vehicle trips in the morning and 2.4 times higher than those in the afternoon. Total person trip generation at the smart-growth study locations was similar to the total person trips estimated from ITE data; however, larger shares of person trips at the smart-growth locations were made by walking, bicycling, or public transit.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/2354-08",""

Characteristics of instantaneous extreme volumetric PFs are examined and compared to those of intermediate and small systems. It is found that instantaneous PFs exhibit a much wider scale range compared to the daily gridded precipitation accumulation range. The top 1% of the rainiest PFs contribute over 55% of total rainfall and have 2 orders of rain volume magnitude greater than those of the median PFs. We find a threshold near the top 10% beyond which the PFs grow exponentially into larger, deeper, and colder rain systems. NCEP reanalyses show that midlevel relative humidity and total precipitable water increase steadily with increasingly larger PFs, along with a rapid increase of 500 hPa upward vertical velocity beyond the top 10%. This provides the necessary moisture convergence to amplify and sustain the extreme events. The rapid increase in vertical motion is associated with the release of convective available potential energy (CAPE) in mature systems, as is evident in the increase in CAPE of PFs up to 10% and the subsequent dropoff. The study illustrates distinct stages in the development of an extreme rainfall event including (1) a systematic buildup in large‐scale temperature and moisture, (2) a rapid change in rain structure, (3) explosive growth of the PF size, and (4) a release of CAPE before the demise of the event.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fjgrd.50776",""

A game is modeled between a manager and an employee, two rational decision makers. The manager makes control decisions based on the strength of controls and on employee trustworthiness, which are modeled as functions of monetary and psychic costs and benefits of committing and not committing fraud. We propose a rich definition of trustworthiness that incorporates an employee’s propensity to commit fraud and sensitivity to controls. Equilibrium strategies are identified that could be used to determine the best strategy and the optimum strength of controls to use by identifying trustworthy, untrustworthy, and opportunistically trustworthy employees. A relationship of trustworthiness with a probabilistic choice of controls by the manager is established. As the strength of controls increases, the trustworthiness of the employees also increases, but a minimum critical level of trustworthiness is required to make controls effective. A high level of control may be needed to deter fraud. Also, this increase in trustworthiness does not translate to a proportional reduction of controls by the manager. We caution against excessive investments in internal controls. A low strength control with high probability of controls may be a cost effective way to deter fraud. We also explore the interaction of controls strength with the losses to the manager when fraud is committed. We find that control is not always a viable strategy. Optimal payoffs indicate that, unlike simultaneous decision making, under sequential decision making, the manager’s best strategy is to choose controls and auditing an employee.

Dorsal striatal‐dependent habit memory may in part influence the development and expression of some human psychopathologies, particularly those characterized by strong habit‐like behavioral features. The present review considers this hypothesis as it pertains to psychopathologies that typically emerge during childhood and adolescence. These disorders include Tourette syndrome, attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder, eating disorders, and autism spectrum disorders. Human and nonhuman animal research shows that the typical development of memory systems comprises the early maturation of striatal‐dependent habit memory and the relatively late maturation of hippocampal‐dependent cognitive memory. We speculate that the differing rates of development of these memory systems may in part contribute to the early emergence of habit‐like symptoms in childhood and adolescence. In addition, abnormalities in hippocampal and striatal brain regions have been observed consistently in youth with these disorders, suggesting that the aberrant development of memory systems may also contribute to the emergence of habit‐like symptoms as core pathological features of these illnesses. Considering these disorders within the context of multiple memory systems may help elucidate the pathogenesis of habit‐like symptoms in childhood and adolescence, and lead to novel treatments that lessen the habit‐like behavioral features of these disorders.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fjcpp.12169",""

This strategy is based on repetitive sequential selection of a spatial pattern once a correct sequence has been identified. We previously reported that electroconvulsive shock (ECS) but not magnetic seizure therapy (MST) impaired performance on a spatial working memory task in a preclinical model. Here we tested the hypothesis that ECS disrupted stereotyped patterns in the selection of spatial stimuli. In a within-subject study design, we assessed the effects of ECS, MST, and sham on stereotypy and reaction time in a preclinical model. Stereotypy was assessed by the correlation of actual and predicted response patterns of spatial stimuli. Predicted patterns were based on performance during baseline sessions. ECS resulted in lower correlations between predicted and actual responses to spatial stimuli in two of the three subjects, and it also disrupted stereotypy. For one subject, there was change in the predictability of the spatial locus of responses between experimental conditions. For all three subjects, reaction time was significantly longer in ECS, relative to MST and sham. This is the first study to examine the effect of ECS, and to contrast the effects of ECS and MST, on spatial working memory component processes. Our preliminary findings show that ECS, but not MST decreased stereotypy and increased reaction time. This line of investigation may have significant implications in our understanding cognitive component processes of memory function and impairment.","http://academic.oup.com/ijnp/article-pdf/16/1/177/30134526/16-1-177.pdf",""

During the overnight hours, mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) developed that moved slowly and produced heavy rainfall over small areas in south-central Texas on 9 June, north Texas on 10 June, and western Arkansas on 11 June. In this study, forecasts of this event from the Center for the Analysis and Prediction of Storms' Storm-Scale Ensemble Forecast system are examined. This ensemble, with 26 members at 4-km horizontal grid spacing, included a few members that very accurately predicted the development, maintenance, and evolution of the heavy-rain-producing MCSs, along with a majority of members that had substantial errors in their precipitation forecasts. The processes favorable for the initiation, organization, and maintenance of these heavy-rain-producing MCSs are diagnosed by comparing ensemble members with accurate and inaccurate forecasts. Even within a synoptic environment known to be conducive to extreme local rainfall, there was considerable spread in the ensemble's rainfall predictions. Because all ensemble members included an anomalously moist environment, the precipitation predictions were insensitive to the atmospheric moisture. However, the development of heavy precipitation overnight was very sensitive to the intensity and evolution of convection the previous day. Convective influences on the strength of the MCV and its associated dome of cold air at low levels determined whether subsequent deep convection was initiated and maintained. In all, this ensemble provides quantitative and qualitative information about the mesoscale processes that are most favorable (or unfavorable) for localized extreme rainfall.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/mwr/article-pdf/141/8/2778/4300215/mwr-d-12-00239_1.pdf",""

The flavones are one of the most studied flavonoid subclasses due to their presence in dietary plants and their potential to protect human cells from reactive oxygen species (ROS). Several flavone compounds also mediate beneficial actions by direct binding to protein receptors and regulatory enzymes. There is current interest in using Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSARs) to guide drug development based on flavone lead structures. This approach is most informative when it involves the use of accurate physical descriptors. The Abraham summation solute hydrogen bonding acidity ( A) is a descriptor in the general solvation equation. It defines the tendency of a molecule to act as a hydrogen bond donor, or acid, when surrounded by solvent molecules that are hydrogen bonding acceptors, or bases. As a linear free energy relationship, it is useful for predicting the absorption and uptake of drug molecules. A previously published method, involving nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, was used to evaluate A for the monohydroxyflavones (MHFs). Values of A ranged from 0.02, for 5-hydroxyflavone, to 0.69 for 4′-hydroxyflavone. The ability to examine separate NMR signals for individual hydroxyl groups allowed the investigation of intramolecular interactions between functional groups. The value of A for the position 7 hydroxyl group of 7-hydroxyflavone was 0.67. The addition of a position 5 hydroxyl group (in 5,7-dihydroxyflavone) increased the value of A for the position 7 hydroxyl group to 0.76. Values of A for MHFs were also calculated by the program ACD-Absolve and these agreed well with values measured by NMR. These results should facilitate more accurate estimation of the values of A for structurally complex flavones with pharmacological activities.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1934578X1300800121",""

However, these effects are rarely direct, and our understanding of such effects are largely based on self-report (v observational) data. More information is needed on the pathways by which concrete PCC behaviors affect specific psychosocial outcomes in cancer care. We hypothesized that PCC behaviors increase the satisfaction of patients with surgeons, which, in turn, reduces the postconsultation hopelessness of patients. Patients and Methods: In Portland, OR, we videotaped consultations between 147 women newly diagnosed with breast cancer and nine surgeons and administered surveys to participants immediately preconsultation and postconsultation. Consultations were coded for PCC behaviors. Multivariate regression models analyzed the association between PCC and the satisfaction of patients and between satisfaction and hopelessness. Results: Levels of hopelessness of patients significantly decreased from preconsultation to postconsultation (P < .001). Two PCC behaviors (ie, patient asserting treatment preference [odds ratio {OR}, 1.50/log unit; 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.23/log unit; P = .042] and surgeon providing good/hopeful news [OR, 1.62/log unit; 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.60/log unit; P = .047]) were independently significantly associated with the satisfaction of patients with surgeons, which, in turn, independently predicted reduced levels of postconsultation hopelessness (linear change, −0.78; 95% CI, 1.44 to −0.12; P = .02). Conclusion: Although additional research is needed with larger and more-diverse data sets, these findings suggest the possibility that concrete and trainable PCC behaviors can lower the hopelessness of patients with breast cancer indirectly through their effects on patient satisfaction with care.","https://ascopubs.org/doi/pdfdirect/10.1200/JCO.2012.44.2699",""

This is usually accomplished using radiographic contrast. Low molecular weight dextran has low cost and is safe in low volumes. In the present study, we compared dextran with contrast for coronary OCT imaging. Methods: Fifty‐one vessels in 26 patients were sequentially imaged using manual injection of radiographic contrast (iodixanol) and dextran. OCT images were analyzed at 1 mm intervals to determine the image clarity (defined as a visible lumen border > 270°) and to measure the lumen area and lumen diameter. To correct for the refractive index of dextran, the dextran area measurements were multiplied by 1.117 and the dextran length measurements were multiplied by 1.057. Results: A total of 3,418 cross‐sections (1,709 with contrast and 1,709 with dextran) were analyzed. There were no complications related to OCT imaging or to contrast or dextran administration.

Otlertuzumab is a CD37-specific therapeutic protein built on the ADAPTIR™(modular protein technology) platform that has shown significantly greater direct killing of CLL cells than rituximab and higher levels of Fc-mediated cellular cytotoxicity of CLL cells than either alemtuzumab or rituximab in pre-clinical models. This phase 1b trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of otlertuzumab in combination with rituximab in patients with previously untreated CLL. Methods: Patients with untreated CLL that required treatment, had adequate organ function, ECOG ≤2, and absolute neutrophil count ≥800/μL were eligible. Patients were ineligible for chemotherapy as first-line therapy due to patient age, comorbidity, or patient refusal of chemotherapy Patients received otlertuzumab (20 mg/kg) weekly by IV infusion for two 28-day cycles then once a month for 4 months. Rituximab (375 mg/m2 the first dose then 500 mg/m2) was administered after otlertuzumab by IV infusion on the same schedule. Safety was evaluated using CTCAE and IWCLL 2008 Grading scale for Hematologic Toxicity in CLL Studies. Response was determined using the 1996 NCI and the 2008 IWCLL Criteria. Results: 24 patients have been treated. Patient characteristics and adverse events are shown in the table. The majority of the patients have not completed 6 cycles of therapy. The preliminary response by investigator assessment using NCI criteria at the last assessment is an ORR 88% (21/24); 2 patients have had PD. Six patients have had CT scans and bone marrow assessments 3 months after their last dose of study drug; by IWCLL criteria 1 has a CR, 4 have a PR and 1 has SD. The patient with a CR was MRD negative by five color flow cytometry of bone marrow aspirate. One patient discontinued therapy for a systemic inflammatory response. Severe (Grade 3 or 4) neutropenia was reported in 13% of patients; the incidence of severe infections was low (8%). Serious adverse events were reported for 4 patients: pneumonia, systemic inflammatory response, and deep vein thrombosis in 1 patient; and lymph node pain, worsening sinusitis, and fever in 1 patient each. Conclusions: The preliminary response rate with otlertuzumab in combination with rituximab is promising. Follow-up is ongoing and the IWCLL response rate will be presented.

Apelin, a small regulatory peptide, is the endogenous ligand for the APJ receptor. Apelin and APJ are expressed in the pancreas. The aims of this study were to examine whether apelin influences the inflammatory and fibrosis responses to pancreatitis in mice and to identify mechanisms behind apelin's activities. Supramaximal cerulein induction of AP or CP caused significant ( P < 0.05) elevations in pancreatic apelin and APJ expression. Levels declined during the recovery phases. In apelin gene-knockout mice with pancreatitis, pancreatic neutrophil invasion and myeloperoxidase activity were enhanced significantly, and apelin treatment suppressed both. Apelin exposure reduced CP-induced elevations of extracellular matrix-associated proteins. Apelin inhibited PDGF-simulated connective tissue growth factor production and proliferation of pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs). Serum granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and keratinocyte cytokine levels were higher in apelin gene-knockout than wild-type mice with pancreatitis. Apelin reduced AP- and CP-induced elevations in pancreatic NF-κB activation. Together, these findings imply that the pancreatic apelin-APJ system functions to curb the inflammatory and fibrosis responses during pancreatitis. Furthermore, findings suggest that apelin reduces inflammation and fibrosis by reducing neutrophil recruitment and PSC activity. Inhibition of neutrophil invasion may be mediated by reduced keratinocyte cytokine and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor secretion. Apelin-induced reductions in PSC proliferation and connective tissue growth factor production are putative mechanisms underlying apelin's inhibition of extracellular matrix production. The apelin-associated changes in NF-κB binding may be linked to apelin's regulation of pancreatic inflammatory and fibrosis responses during pancreatitis.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpgi.00370.2012",""

Deregulation of MT dynamics leads to chromosome missegregation, cytokinesis failure and improper inheritance of genetic materials. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of KIAA1383/MTR120 (microtubule regulator 120 kDa) as a novel MT-associated protein. We found that MTR120 localizes to stabilized MTs during interphase and to the mitotic apparatus during mitosis. MTR120 overexpression results in MT bundling and acetylation. In vitro, purified MTR120 protein binds to and bundles preassembled MTs. Moreover, depletion of MTR120 by RNA interference leads to cytokinesis failure and polyploidy. These phenotypes can be rescued by wild-type MTR120 but not by the MT non-binding mutant of MTR120. Together, these data suggest that MTR120 is a novel MT-associated protein that directly stabilizes MTs and hence ensures the fidelity of cell division.","http://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article-pdf/126/3/825/1926717/jcs-126-03-0825.pdf",""

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), members of the TGF-β superfamily, have anti-fibrogenic functions, in contrast to TGF-β, in the kidney, lung, and liver. However, it is not known whether BMPs have an anti-fibrogenic role in the pancreas. The current study was designed to investigate the potential anti-fibrogenic role of BMPs in the pancreas using an in vivo CP model and an in vitro PSC model. CP was induced by repetitive intraperitoneal injections of cerulein in adult Swiss Webster mice. The control mice received saline injections. Compared with the control, cerulein injections induced a time-dependent increase in acinar injury and progression of fibrosis and a steady increase in inflammation. Cerulein injections also induced increases of the extracellular matrix (ECM) protein fibronectin and of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)-positive stellate cells (PSCs). The mice receiving cerulein injections showed increased BMP2 protein levels and phosphorylated Smad1 levels up to 4 wk and then declined at 8 wk to similar levels as the control. In vitro, the isolated mouse and human PSCs were cultured and pretreated with BMP2 followed by TGF-β treatment. BMP2 pretreatment inhibited TGF-β-induced α-SMA, fibronectin, and collagen type Ia expression. Knocking down Smad1 with small-interfering RNA reversed the inhibitory effect of BMP2 on TGF-β-induced α-SMA and fibronectin expression. Thus, BMP2 opposes the fibrogenic function of TGF-β in PSCs through the Smad1 signaling pathway.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpgi.00306.2012",""

These aspects of prefrontal cortex architecture, furthermore, are increased in comparison to chimpanzees and other great apes. In order to determine the developmental appearance of this human cortical specialization, we examined the spatial organization of neurons in four cortical regions (frontal pole [Brodmann's area 10], primary motor [area 4], primary somatosensory [area 3b], and prestriate visual cortex [area 18]) in chimpanzees and humans from birth to approximately the time of adolescence (11 years of age). Horizontal spacing distance (HSD) and gray level ratio (GLR) of layer III neurons were measured in Nissl‐stained sections. In both human and chimpanzee area 10, HSD was significantly higher in the postweaning specimens compared to the preweaning ones. No significant age‐related differences were seen in the other regions in either species. In concert with other recent studies, the current findings suggest that there is a relatively slower maturation of area 10 in both humans and chimpanzees as compared to other cortical regions, and that further refinement of the spatial organization of neurons within this prefrontal area in humans takes place after the postweaning periods included here.

We screened 2223 Caucasian normal control and 143 SLE sera for ANA, anti-chromatin, anti-Ro and anti-SSB antibodies. Further, we employed protein array screening to detect antibodies against over 90 different auto-antigens. Our data show that about 26% of the normal population are ANA positive, with 17% (382 of 2223) having moderate (20-40 ELISA units) and 9% (197 of 2223) having high (&gt;40 ELISA units) ANA antibody levels. Chromatin ELISA and Crithidia luciliae immunofluorescence tests (CLIFT) confirmed the absence of anti-chromatin antibodies in the ANA positive fraction of the normal population. Results of Anti-Ro-52 ELISA showed that 6.5% (3/46) moderate ANA NCs, 40.4% (17/42) high ANA NCs and 26.3% (25/95) SLEs test positive for anti-Ro-52 antibodies. Interestingly, a very strong correlation was observed between ANA and anti-Ro-52 antibodies in the high ANA (Pearson r =0.69, p&lt;0.0001) and SLE group (Pearson r =0.66, p&lt;0.0001). We also investigated ANA positivity as a function of age in the normal population and found that correlation between ANA and Ro-52 antibodies was stronger in subjects under 50 year of age (Pearson r =0.75, p&lt;0.0001) than that of those above 50 year (Pearson r =0.57, p&lt;0.0001).

A series of software development efforts have culminated in the production of NYSLAB, an analysis tool for jointed pavement that can predict the complete thermomechanical response, including pavement curling and interactions between slab and foundation. A series of studies were developed in NYSLAB specifically to look into slab–foundation friction generated by nonlinear thermal gradients and traffic loads. Nonlinear temperature gradients can produce slab expansion and contraction that lead to frictional traction between slabs and foundation. The prediction of these friction tractions is complicated by the curling of the slabs that cause some portions of the slabs to lose contact with the foundation. The results of the studies highlight the importance of considering these frictional tractions in the analysis of jointed concrete pavements because they have a significant impact on the bending stresses of portland cement concrete slabs.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/2367-13",""

We hypothesized that the intravenous injection of MAPCs after TBI attenuates the inflammatory response (as measured by microglial morphology) and improves performance at motor tasks and spatial learning (Morris water maze [MWM]). MAPCs were administered intravenously 2 and 24 hours after a cortical contusion injury (CCI). We tested four groups at 120 days after TBI: sham (uninjured), injured but not treated (CCI), and injured and treated with one of two concentrations of MAPCs, either 2 million cells per kilogram (CCI-2) or 10 million cells per kilogram (CCI-10). CCI-10 rats showed significant improvement in left hind limb deficit on the balance beam. On the fifth day of MWM trials, CCI-10 animals showed a significant decrease in both latency to platform and distance traveled compared with CCI. Probe trials revealed a significant decrease in proximity measure in CCI-10 compared with CCI, suggesting improved memory retrieval. Neuroinflammation was quantified by enumerating activated microglia in the ipsilateral hippocampus. We observed a significant decrease in the number of activated microglia in the dentate gyrus in CCI-10 compared with CCI. Our results demonstrate that intravenous MAPC treatment after TBI in a rodent model offers long-term improvements in spatial learning as well as attenuation of neuroinflammation.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.5966%2Fsctm.2013-0100",""

The objective of this study was to reevaluate this association using different statistical methods to control for confounding and selection bias. METHODS: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)‐Medicare linked data (1992‐2007) was used to identify patients with locoregional pancreatic cancer. Two‐year survival in patients who did and did not receive EUS was compared by using standard Cox proportional hazards models, propensity score methodology, and instrumental variable analysis. RESULTS: EUS was associated with improved survival in both unadjusted (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.63‐0.72) and standard regression analyses (HR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.73‐0.84) which controlled for age, sex, race, marital status, tumor stage, SEER region, Charlson comorbidity, year of diagnosis, education, preoperative biliary stenting, chemotherapy, radiation, and pancreatic resection. Propensity score adjustment, matching, and stratification did not attenuate this survival benefit. In an instrumental variable analysis, the survival benefit was no longer observed (HR = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.73‐1.36).

Match-ups between in situ measurements of CDOM absorption coefficients at 412 nm (aCDOM(412)) with that derived from SeaWiFS were examined using two previously reported reflectance band ratio algorithms. Results indicate better performance using the Rrs(510)/Rrs(555) (Bias = −0.045; RMSE = 0.23; SI = 0.49, and R2 = 0.66) than the Rrs(490)/Rrs(555) reflectance band ratio algorithm. Further, a comparison of aCDOM(412) retrievals using the Rrs(488)/Rrs(555) for MODIS and Rrs(510)/Rrs(560) for MERIS reflectance band ratios revealed better CDOM retrievals with MERIS data. Since DOC cannot be measured directly by remote sensors, CDOM as the colored component of DOC is utilized as a proxy to estimate DOC remotely. A seasonal relationship between CDOM and DOC was established for the summer and spring-winter with high correlation for both periods (R2~0.9). Seasonal band ratio empirical algorithms to estimate DOC were thus developed using the relationships between CDOM-Rrs and seasonal CDOM-DOC for SeaWiFS, MODIS and MERIS. Results of match-up comparisons revealed DOC estimates by both MODIS and MERIS to be relatively more accurate during summer time, while both of them underestimated DOC during spring-winter time. A better DOC estimate from MERIS in comparison to MODIS in spring-winter could be attributed to its similarity with the SeaWiFS band ratio CDOM algorithm.","https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/5/3/1439/pdf",""

In contrast, dendritic cells (DC) are infected but fail to mature appropriately, thereby impairing the T cell response. We investigated the contributions of EBOV proteins in modulating DC maturation by generating recombinant viruses expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein and carrying mutations affecting several potentially immunomodulating domains. They included envelope glycoprotein (GP) domains, as well as innate response antagonist domains (IRADs) previously identified in the VP24 and VP35 proteins. GP expressed by an unrelated vector, but not the wild-type EBOV, was found to strongly induce DC maturation, and infections with recombinant EBOV carrying mutations disabling GP functional domains did not restore DC maturation. In contrast, each of the viruses carrying mutations disabling any IRAD in VP35 induced a dramatic upregulation of DC maturation markers. This was dependent on infection, but not interaction with GP. Disabling of IRADs also resulted in up to a several hundredfold increase in secretion of cytokines and chemokines. Furthermore, these mutations induced formation of homotypic DC clusters, which represent close correlates of their maturation and presumably facilitate transfer of antigen from migratory DC to lymph node DC. Thus, an individual IRAD is insufficient to suppress DC maturation; rather, the suppression of DC maturation and the “immune paralysis” observed during EBOV infections results from a cooperative effect of two or more individual IRADs.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.03316-12",""

Despite being a common procedure, few studies have investigated the effect of matrix acidizing on the physical properties and oil recovery factors in shales. This paper describes the effect of HCl treatment on porosity, spontaneous imbibition, and crack distribution in samples from the Eagle Ford, Mancos, Barnett and Marcellus shale formations. Samples measuring 2.54–3.81 cm in diameter and 2.54–5.08 cm in length were exposed to acid with concentrations between 0.8–3% active HCl (4 and 15% of 20% diluted HCl). Active acid concentrations of 0.8% were optimal for balancing enhanced oil recovery while maintaining samples structural stability and integrity. The Pre and post HCl treated samples were saturated with Soltrol 130™. Oil recovery was determined by measuring the quantities of oil displaced by uptake of saline water. Recovery factors for Mancos and Eagle Ford shale samples improved from 4 and 16% for non-treated samples to 36 and 71% for the treated samples. In contrast, no change in Barnett and Marcellus shale recovery factors were observed. Porosities were calculated using X-ray computed tomography (CT–scanning). Average porosities prior to acid treatment were 1.6 – 3.7% versus 1.6–10.7% after acid treatment. The CT-scanning studies of treated samples also shows that in the Mancos shale randomly oriented cracks developed, while in the Barnett and Marcellus shales cracks developed along bedding planes; very little crack development was observed in Eagle Ford shales. These results are encouraging for the application of matrix acidizing in shale formations to improve microfractures conductivity at distances along strike from the wellbore.","http://onepetro.org/SPENAIC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/167568-MS/1594473/spe-167568-ms.pdf",""

Such observations have suggested a widespread decrease between the 1950s and 1980s (global dimming), that is, at a rate of −3.5 W m−2 decade−1 (or −2% decade−1) from 1960 to 1990. Since the early 1990s, the diffuse and direct components of G have been measured independently, and a more accurate G has been calculated by summing these two measurements. Data from this summation method suggest that G increased at a rate of 6.6 W m−2 decade−1 (3.6% decade−1) from 1992 to 2002 (brightening) at selected sites. The brightening rates from these studies were also higher than those from a single pyranometer. In this paper, the authors used 17 years (1995–2011) of parallel measurements by the two methods from nearly 50 stations to test whether these two measurement methods of G provide similar long-term trends. The results show that although measurements of G by the two methods agree very well on a monthly time scale, the long-term trend from 1995 to 2011 determined by the single pyranometer is 2–4 W m−2 decade−1 less than that from the summation method. This difference of trends in the observed G is statistically significant. The dependence of trends of G on measurement methods uncovered here has an important implication for the widely reported global dimming and brightening based on datasets collected by different measurement methods; that is, the dimming might have been less if measured with current summation methods.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jcli/article-pdf/26/12/4112/3999010/jcli-d-12-00482_1.pdf",""

We characterized the physical environment and presence of dams in a series of reaches in three eastern Iowa rivers tributary to the Mississippi River and related these characteristics to the fish assemblages present. Some physical characteristics were similar among the 12 study reaches, whereas others differed substantially. We found a total of 68 species across the 12 study reaches; 56 in the Turkey River, 51 in the Maquoketa River and 50 in the Wapsipinicon River. Seventeen species could be described as ‘downstream‐distributed’; 15 being found only in the lowest reach of one or more rivers and the other two being found only in the lowest reaches or two or more contiguous reaches including the lowest reach. Two species could be described as ‘upstream‐distributed’, being found only in an uppermost reach. Non‐metric multidimensional scaling ordination illustrated similarities among reaches, and five physical variables were significantly correlated with assemblage similarities. Catchment area and number of dams between reaches and the Mississippi River were strongly correlated with assemblage similarities, but the directions of their effects were opposite. Catchment area and number of dams were confounded. The collective evidence to date suggests that the pervasiveness of dams on rivers significantly alters fish assemblages, making underlying patterns of species change and relationships with naturally varying and human‐influenced physical characteristics along a river's course difficult to discern.

Bruggeman’s model, which is widely used to determine these effective properties, is solely based on the volume fraction of these porous electrodes. However, other factors like the topology and microstructure of electrodes also play a crucial role in determining effective properties. In this paper, a general derivation of the effective thermal conductivity of multiphase materials, which can be correlated with these factors, is derived using the volume averaging technique. For demonstration, three-dimensional microstructures of various porous materials are reconstructed from scanned images. These images are used to generate fully-resolved finite volume meshes representing the various constituents. The resulting mesh is then employed for numerical analysis of thermal transport, results from which are used for correlating the effective thermal conductivity with various parameters describing the microstructure. It is shown that commonly used power law exponents in the Bruggeman model for effective thermal conductivity must be recalibrated to fit the effective thermal conductivity computed from these detailed simulations.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/HT/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/HT2013-17577/4241531/v003t21a016-ht2013-17577.pdf",""

Design and Methods: Adipocytes were treated with recombinant lipocalin‐2 (rLcn2) to determine the effect on lipid metabolism. rLcn2 was injected into mice to determine the effect on metabolism in vivo. To assess the relationship between Lcn2 and fat oxidation (FatOx) in humans, normal weight (NW) and obese (OB) women were given three separate high fat (HF) meals followed by indirect calorimetry. The relationship between postprandial Lcn2 with macronutrient metabolism and total energy expenditure (TEE) using Pearson correlations was determined. Results: Lcn2 increased expression of genes involved in β‐oxidation including peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor‐δ in adipocytes, as well as Conclusions: Lipocalin‐2 is a novel adipokine that promotes FatOx and TEE and its function may be impaired in obesity.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Foby.20507",""
