The aim of this review is to evaluate barriers to adopting telemedicine worldwide through the analysis of published work. Methods: The authors conducted a systematic literature review by extracting the data from the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and PubMed (MEDLINE) research databases. The reviewers in this study analysed 30 articles (nine from CINAHL and 21 from Medline) and identified barriers found in the literature. This review followed the checklist from Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2009. The reviewers organized the results into one table and five figures that depict the data in different ways, organized by: barrier, country-specific barriers, organization-specific barriers, patient-specific barriers, and medical-staff and programmer-specific barriers. Results: The reviewers identified 33 barriers with a frequency of 100 occurrences through the 30 articles. The study identified the issues with technically challenged staff (11%), followed by resistance to change (8%), cost (8%), reimbursement (5%), age of patient (5%), and level of education of patient (5%). All other barriers occurred at or less than 4% of the time. Discussion and conclusions: Telemedicine is not yet ubiquitous, and barriers vary widely. The top barriers are technology-specific and could be overcome through training, change-management techniques, and alternating delivery by telemedicine and personal patient-to-provider interaction. The results of this study identify several barriers that could be eliminated by focused policy. Future work should evaluate policy to identify which one to lever to maximize the results.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1357633X16674087",""

Its templated CUDA implementation unifies all of these computations in a single 100-statement kernel. SAM is communication-efficient in the sense that it minimizes main-memory accesses. When computing prefix sums of a million or more values, it outperforms Thrust and CUDPP on both a Titan X and a K40 GPU. On the Titan X, SAM reaches memory-copy speeds for large input sizes, which cannot be surpassed. SAM outperforms CUB, the currently fastest conventional prefix sum implementation, by up to a factor of 2.9 on eighth-order prefix sums and by up to a factor of 2.6 on eight-tuple prefix sums.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2980983.2908089",""

Constructivist practices embedded in the business simulation are investigated to understand their potentials for helping the students to overcome the perceived difficulty. Consequently, it would enable instructors to more efficiently use the simulator by providing insights on its pedagogical practices.

Childhood obesity is a strong predictor of obesity in adulthood; thus, obese children are more likely to experience serious health conditions as adults. These risks highlight the need for early obesity interventions. Rates of overweight and obesity among children in San Marcos, Texas are higher than state and national averages. Previous studies in this region have found that many toddlers and preschoolers are not meeting dietary recommendations either at childcare centers or at home.

We suggest that participants import military culture into VTC processes and that the military will have an influence on VTC proceedings. The purpose of this study is to examine how military and specialty court approaches appear in the VTC. Using results from field research in a VTC in Texas, we find the military has profound influences in VTC proceedings.

Voluntary reporting to the Supplementary Homicide Report (SHR), the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS), and the Arrest-Related Death Program (ARDP) are subject to underreporting and classification errors. The same shortcomings apply to statewide reporting in California and Texas, the only states with mandatory reporting requirements. Content analysis of open source records identified officer-involved shooting fatalities that occurred in the United States from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2015. Those data were compared with data from the government databases. Analysis revealed 7,869 officer-involved shooting fatalities, an average increase of 51.8 incidents per year. Fatalities increased from 594 in 2006 to 1,007 in 2015—an increase of 69.5% in 10 years. Government data sources reported a low of 46.0% of incidents to a high of 75.3%, depending on the reporting year. Open source research reveals 30% to 45% more cases than official federal or state databases and can reveal much more data about other critical questions. The history of federal program efforts suggests it is unlikely that government recording of data on officer-involved shooting fatalities will improve. Government reporting programs have produced decreasingly effective results. Current web-based data collection efforts suffer from many of the same limitations exhibited in the federal programs. One promising option for improved data collection includes funding an independent party, such as a university, to collect data from open sources and supplement that data with public records requests and the currently collected official government data.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0887403416650927",""

Perceiving these defendants as more dangerous, jurors may be more likely to favor the death penalty when such evidence is presented. This is counter to the intuition that abuse or neglect reduces culpability, and therefore mitigates the severity of punishment. We investigated the effect of defendant childhood physical abuse, sexual abuse, or neglect on the probability of a prospective juror preferring the death penalty in an between‐subject experimental design. Using vignettes and two large samples (students and jurors), defendant histories were found to mitigate the probability that the hypothetical defendant received the death penalty, with sexual abuse having the most salient effect. Further, the effects were conditioned by preference for the death penalty – larger mitigating effects were observed among individuals who favor the death penalty. These findings suggest that initial judgments of abuse and neglect are related to juror leniency, and further research on the interaction of jury instructions and defendant histories is needed.

The objective of this review and narrative analysis is to identify and analyse facilitators and barriers to adoption of mHealth for the elderly. Methods: Studies over the last year were identified in multiple database indices, and three reviewers examined abstracts ( k = 0.82) and analysed articles for themes which were tallied in affinity diagrams to identify frequency of occurrence in the literature (n = 36). Results: The three facilitators mentioned most often were independence (18%), understanding (13%), and visibility (13%). The three barriers mentioned most often were complexity (21%), limited by users (12%) and ineffective (12%). Discussion and conclusions: The reviewers concluded that the work done so far illustrates that mHealth enables a perception of independence.

Using a combination of confocal photoluminescence (PL), time-resolved PL, and low-temperature PL emission spectroscopy, two extended defect types were identified and the impact of these defects on charge-carrier recombination was analyzed. The dominant defects identified by confocal PL were dislocations in samples grown on (211)B CdTe substrates and crystallographic twinning-related defects in samples on (100)-oriented InSb substrates. Low-temperature PL shows that twin-related defects have a zero-phonon energy of 1.460 eV and a Huang-Rhys factor of 1.50, while dislocation-dominated samples have a 1.473-eV zero-phonon energy and a Huang-Rhys factor of 1.22.

One method relied on a compound Ga2O3 source with oxygen plasma while the second used elemental Ga source with oxygen plasma. A side-by-side comparison of the growth parameters between these two methods has been demonstrated. With various substrate temperatures, pure phase (2¯01) oriented β-Ga2O3 thin films were obtained using both sources. Reflection high energy electron diffraction patterns displayed a threefold reconstruction during the growth. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis showed a shift in the binding energy of the Ga 2p peaks consistent with a Ga being in a +3 oxidation state. For transparent oxide like β-Ga2O3, it is important to determine the index of refraction (n) and its functional dependence on the wavelength. The Cauchy dispersion relation was employed to evaluate the refractive index, film thickness, roughness values, and extinction coefficient. The band gap energies of the thin films were calculated to be ∼5.02 eV by extrapolating the linear portion of Tauc-plot analysis and the refractive index is ∼1.89 at the wavelength (λ) of 6328 Å, suggesting high structural quality and packing density of the oxide films.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-pdf/doi/10.1116/1.4942045/13431789/02l109_1_online.pdf",""

This channel plays a crucial role in sodium regulation, which is important for proper blood pressure and fluid balance. Located in the distal portion of nephrons within the kidney, the channel selectively regulates the reabsorption of sodium. Genetic mutations in ENaC have shown to cause disease states of hypertension in Liddle's syndrome and hypotension in pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1. Prior studies have focused on regulation of ENaC via protein‐protein interactions, such as an ubiquitin‐protein ligase Nedd4‐2, a ubiquitin transferase domain HECT, and serine/threonine‐protein kinases Sgk1, much is still unknown about ENaC. Our studies include expression of ENaC in yeast deletion strains to identify proteins necessary for ENaC function. A serial dilution pronging assay was performed for each separate deletion yeast strain. Results showed that although no tested strains had direct effect on ENaC functionality, the coated vesicle protein COPII, a Rubb1p (NEDD8) activator protein, and a p24 protein component involved in vesicle quality control all had negative effects on cell growth with and without salt present when particular ENaC subunits (β/γ) or all ENaC subunits (α/β/γ) were present. Further analysis of genes encoding proteins associated with ENaC will provide more insight into ENaC and its role in sodium homeostasis.","",""

Recent surveys of internal auditors find that a component of this coordination is external auditors' involvement in developing the IAF's audit plans. Nevertheless, it is not known how such involvement affects external auditors' reliance on the internal control test work of the IAF, either before or after a negative audit discovery. Based on an experiment with 107 experienced auditors, we find that external auditors involved in the development of the IAF's audit plan perceive the IAF as more objective and that both objectivity and involvement contribute to these auditors' placing more reliance on the IAF as compared to external auditors with no involvement. This initial reliance results in the involved auditors' proposing reductions to the audit budget and re-performing less of the IAF's work. Consistent with an anchoring bias, we find that involvement leads to external auditors' continuing to place greater reliance on the IAF's work, even after they become aware of a negative audit discovery that should not have occurred had the client's controls been effective.","https://publications.aaahq.org/ajpt/article-pdf/35/4/159/49563/ajpt-51486.pdf",""

Past research suggests that distracted pedestrians are less likely to show cautionary crossing habits and tend toward increased crossing times. This study provided information about the pedestrian waiting to cross and investigated how distraction and other factors may have affected pedestrian start-up time and crossing behaviors. Researchers surreptitiously observed 760 pedestrians at three intersections in College Station, Texas, and coded their characteristics and behavior in real time. Characteristics recorded were age, gender, distraction, and grouping. Distractions recorded were talking on a phone, texting, listening to music, eating, drinking, smoking, and other. The pedestrian groups were no group (crossed alone), mixed-age group, and peer group. Behaviors recorded were glancing before entering the crosswalk, entering the crosswalk early, walking within the crosswalk markings, and hurrying across the crosswalk. Pedestrians who texted and pedestrians who talked on a phone had 21% and 31% more start-up time, respectively. Additionally, pedestrians in mixed-age groups had 14% more start-up time. Texting pedestrians were about two times less likely to glance before entering the crosswalk compared with undistracted pedestrians. Similarly, a pedestrian engaged in a phone conversation was about five times less likely to glance. These results may provide insight into ongoing discussion on how to address distracted pedestrians crossing the street.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/2586-13",""

We note that heavy workloads during the internship decreased the degree of commitment to a particular firm. On the other hand, offering challenging work assignments and surrounding the intern with desirable coworkers significantly increased commitment to both the firm and the profession. We also find that changes in organizational commitment are related to changes in interns' long-term intentions to work in public accounting, and that by the end of the internship, nearly 60 percent of the interns changed their views with regard to how long they planned to work in public accounting, with a majority of respondents anticipating a shorter career in the profession.","https://publications.aaahq.org/iae/article-pdf/32/2/47/60999/iace-51431.pdf",""

With a current market share of 44%, thermoplastic-based additive manufacturing such as fused deposition modeling (FDM) is a prevailing technology. A key challenge for AM parts (especially for parts made by FDM) in engineering applications is the weak inter-layer adhesion. The lack of bonding between filaments usually results in delamination and mechanical failure. To address this challenge, this study embedded carbon nanotubes into acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) thermoplastics via a filament extrusion process. The vigorous response of carbon nanotubes to microwave irradiation, leading to the release of a large amount of heat, is used to melt the ABS thermoplastic matrix adjacent to carbon nanotubes within a very short time period. This treatment is found to enhance the inter-layer adhesion without bulk heating to deform the 3D printed parts. Tensile and flexural tests were performed to evaluation the effects of microwave irradiation on mechanical properties of the specimens made by FDM. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images were taken to characterize the fracture surfaces of tensile test specimens. The actual carbon nanotube contents in the filaments were measured by conducting thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The effects of microwave irradiation on the electrical resistivity of the filament were also reported.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/MSEC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/MSEC2016-8790/4422821/v003t08a007-msec2016-8790.pdf",""

Spring fishes, many of which are endemic, are associated with the spring complexes, whereas river fishes generally avoid spring complexes. Purposes of this study were to experimentally test affinities of spring fishes and river fishes for spring complexes and rivers among six independent spring‐river systems of the Edwards Plateau and to quantitate relationship among spring fishes, river fishes and spring flow magnitude within spring complexes. We found that spring fishes did not exclusively use spring complexes but were more abundant in spring complexes than rivers and that species richness, relative abundance, and density of spring fishes were directly related to spring flow magnitude. Patterns in affinities for river fishes were less distinct. Quantitation of fish–habitat relationships will assist efforts in conserving aquatic resources within the Edwards Plateau and provides predictive models to assess biological integrity of other spring complexes. In addition, consistency in distributional patterns of spring and river fishes provides a framework for testing underlying processes of species segregation and diversification, establishes boundaries of aquatic evolutionary refugia, and expands the value of evolutionary refugia from historical refugia to contemporary and future refugia for Edwards Plateau aquatic biota.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fecs2.1205",""

Using a transcendental phenomenological research design, 12 long-haul truck drivers who met screening criteria were selected using purposeful maximum sampling. Seven broad themes were identified: access to health resources, barriers to health behaviors, recommended alternative settings, constituents of health behavior, motivation for health behaviors, attitude toward health behaviors, and trucking culture.

Ventilator auto-trigger can be misinterpreted as a spontaneous breath and has the potential to delay or prevent brain death testing and confuse health-care professionals and/or patient families. Objective:: To determine the frequency of organ donor referrals from 1 Organ Procurement Organization (OPO) that could benefit from an algorithm designed to assist organ recovery coordinators to identify and correct ventilator auto-triggering. Design:: This retrospective analysis evaluated documentation of organ donor referrals from 1 OPO in central Texas during the 2013 calendar year that resulted in the withdrawal of care by the patient’s family and the recovery of organs. Main Outcome Measures:: The frequency of referrals that presented with absent brain stem reflexes except for additional respirations over the set ventilator rate was determined to assess for the need of the proposed algorithm. Results:: Documentation of 672 organ procurement organization referrals was evaluated. Documentation from 42 referrals that resulted in the withdrawal of care and 21 referrals that resulted in the recovery of organs were identified with absent brain stem reflexes except for spontaneous respirations on the mechanical ventilator. As a result, an algorithm designed to identify and correct ventilator auto-trigger could have been used 63 times during the 2013 calendar year.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1526924816640649",""

Striatal tonic dopamine levels were operationalized using spontaneous eyeblink rate.

However, the volume occupied by the adsorbed layer is generally overlooked by current industry standards and numerical models. In addition, stress dependence of matrix pores does not draw as much attention as hydraulic fractures, and surface diffusion has not been included in commercial simulators. Moreover, all these effects significantly affect each other, which can lead to additional complexity of gas transport and production. Therefore, development of an integrative model with consideration of these complicated mechanisms is needed. In this paper, we develop such a fully coupled model for shale-gas-reservoir simulations. We present the derivation of models reflecting the time-dependence effects of gas adsorption/desorption upon original gas in place (OGIP) and petrophysical properties. In particular, both the Langmuir and Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET) (Brunauer et al. 1938) isotherms are included by use of a unified formula. Surface diffusion of adsorbed layer is also added to this model on the basis of rigorous derivation. More features, such as non-Darcy flow and stress dependence in matrix, natural fractures, hydraulic fractures, and leakage effect between matrix and natural fractures, are incorporated. After that, we present an implicit numerical algorithm to solve the model. Numerical simulations were performed in both 1D and 3D cases and compared with two sets of experimental data and three sets of production data in Marcellus and Barnett shale-gas fields. The simulations indicated that the new simulator cannot only lead to consistent results with these data, but also gives an accurate estimation of OGIP, which traditional models failed to do. It is noted that the model parameters we used for the simulations were close to the values suggested by the literature, if available. By use of this validated simulator, we demonstrated applications with respect to real shale reservoirs, studied the effects of the model parameters upon the gas transport and production, and achieved a variety of new insights.","http://onepetro.org/SJ/article-pdf/22/01/244/2109775/spe-174996-pa.pdf",""

The cohort was categorized into 3 groups according to the number of claims patients had with a diagnosis of RA in the year prior to the cancer diagnosis: 2‐RA (patients with ≥2 claims), 1‐RA (1 claim), and no claims. Overall survival was estimated for these groups and for each cancer, using Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for covariates. Results: The cohort included 139,097 patients with cancer (35,026 breast, 43,181 prostate, 31,103 colorectal, and 29,787 lung); 1.7% had 1 RA claim, and 1.1% had 2 or more. Adjusted hazard ratios for patients in the 2‐RA group were 1.41 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.21–1.65) for breast and 1.53 (95% CI 1.26–1.85) for prostate. No significant differences were observed for those with colorectal or lung cancer. Conclusion: Mortality was increased by 40% and 50%, respectively, in elderly patients with RA who developed breast or prostate cancer, after controlling for other comorbidities. This association was not seen in cancers with shorter survival time (colorectal or lung). Research is needed to determine whether the increased risk is related to comorbid burden or to differential utilization of cancer or rheumatoid therapies in patients with both diseases.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Facr.22997",""

Although this form of interviewing has much potential as a data collection tool, it has received scant attention in the qualitative research literature. Thus, the purpose of this article is to provide a framework for using paired depth interviews as a method of collecting qualitative data. In this manuscript, we define and describe paired depth interviews, discuss conceptualizations of paired depth interviews using Roulston’s (2010) framework, delineate the strengths and limitations of paired depth interviews, and provide examples of paired depth interviews utilized in helping professions.

The responses of geologic models to injection of large volumes of CO2 are evaluated using a proxy that approximates pressure distribution using a random walk particle tracking algorithm and computes surface deformation using a stress-field solver. The geologic models showing similar proxy responses are grouped into clusters by invoking multi-dimensional scaling and k-means clustering. A representative model of each cluster is chosen and its simulation results are compared to the observation. The resultant posterior ensemble consists of models that belong to one or more clusters whose representative models are not only in good agreement with given observation data but also non-dominated to other representative models. The usefulness of the model selection approach is demonstrated on CO2 sequestration of a fractured gas reservoir at In Salah, Central Algeria. The explicit coupling of the connectivity estimator and the stress solver reproduces similar migration patterns of CO2 plume to those obtained using full-physics numerical simulations. Incorporating time-lapse observations measured using satellite-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar imposes additional constraints to refine geologic models by improving the matching quality of bottomhole pressure, and thereby contributes to a further reduction in geologic uncertainty. The multi-objective optimization process implemented in the model selection process yields a diversified model set than those obtained using a global optimization procedure. The posterior ensemble exhibits consistent geologic characteristics in terms of spatial distribution and orientation of migration pathways. The posterior ensemble is then used as an initial population for a multi-objective history matching procedure. The results of model selection and expansion process indicate that the implementation of Pareto-optimality is advantageous to realize diversified geologic models that yield unbiased assessment of uncertainty associated with prediction of future CO2 plume migration.","http://onepetro.org/SPEATCE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/181569-MS/1367276/spe-181569-ms.pdf",""

Findings: We argue that based on the nature of their data as well as the current dominant conceptualization of OCD in the literature, this conclusion is untenable. The authors inferred behavioral impulsivity, whereas their main finding was concerning cognitive impulsivity or difficulties in planning. Such items on the Barratt impulsiveness scale have been shown in other research to overpredict behavioral impulsive tendencies in OCD, where the nature of the condition involves doubting of action and a conservative estimate of how one’s cognitions may impact behavior. Conclusions: We conclude that similar to drug addiction, compulsive rituals in OCD may be governed by a negative reinforcement mechanism; the available data indicate that OCD does not share the two main components seen in addiction, namely, behavioral impulsivity and risky decision making.","https://akjournals.com/downloadpdf/journals/2006/5/3/article-p395.xml",""

Using structural equation modeling of data from 138 parent to child dyads [children's mean age at Time 1 (T1) was 13.44 years, SD = 1.16], we tested children's negative emotionality (CNE) at T1 and low attention focusing (LAF) at Time 2 (T2) as sequential mediators in the relation between parent and child negative emotion reciprocity at T1 and children's grade point average (GPA) and inhibitory control at T2.

Also, the unique dyadic contexts of each parents’ supportive coparenting, and also both partners’ parental stress were significantly associated with relationship quality. Clinical implications from these findings are discussed through commonly used clinical theories.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fjmft.12194",""

Based on the separations between the energy peak positions of the FX emission lines, the identical PL decay kinetics among different FX emission lines, and the known phonon modes in h-BN, we suggest that there is only one principal emission line corresponding to the direct intrinsic FX transition in h-BN, whereas all other fine features are a result of phonon-assisted transitions.

High energy planetary ball milling of LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 (NMC) cathode materials was investigated as a route to reduce the particle size and improve the electrochemical performance. The effect of ball milling times, milling speeds, and composition on the structure and properties of NMC cathodes was determined. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that ball milling decreased primary particle (crystallite) size by up to 29%, and the crystallite size was correlated with the milling time and milling speed. Using relatively mild milling conditions that provided an intermediate crystallite size, cathodes with higher capacities, improved rate capabilities, and improved capacity retention were obtained within 14 μm-thick electrode configurations. High milling speeds and long milling times not only resulted in smaller crystallite sizes but also lowered electrochemical performance. Beyond reduction in crystallite size, ball milling was found to increase the interfacial charge transfer resistance, lower the electrical conductivity, and produce aggregates that influenced performance. Computations support that electrolyte diffusivity within the cathode and film thickness play a significant role in the electrode performance. This study shows that cathodes with improved performance are obtained through use of mild ball milling conditions and appropriately designed electrodes that optimize the multiple transport phenomena involved in electrochemical charge storage materials.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/electrochemical/article-pdf/doi/10.1115/1.4034755/6034596/jeecs_013_03_031001.pdf",""

A meta-analysis across studies manipulating fertility status of the pictured woman found a significant effect of fertility status on both jealousy and mate guarding. Women with attractive partners viewed fertile-phase women as less trustworthy, which led to increased mate guarding (Study 2).

It is non-toxic (the FDA classification of montmorillonite is GRAS (‘generally regarded as safe’ for most applications)). The surface area of the particle is enormous (&gt;750m2/g). The capacity of montmorillonite to have a negative charge allows for the modification of the montmorillonite with quaternary ammonium ions (which have a positive charge) to displace the inorganic counter ions associated with the mineral. This displacement provides a wide range of hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance on the surface of montmorillonite which is key to the utilization of organomontmorillonites in a wide range of different markets (rheology control for coatings, inks, oil-well drilling fluids, grease, etc. and polymer nanocomposites).

Objectives: To assess the association between maternal exposure to radiologic exams during the periconceptional period and 19 categories of birth defects using a large population‐based study of birth defects. Methods: We studied 27,809 case mothers and 10,200 control mothers who participated in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study and delivered between 1997 and 2009. Maternal exposure to radiologic exams that delivered ionizing radiation to the urinary tract, lumbar spine, abdomen, or pelvis were identified based on the mother's report of type of radiologic exams, organ or body part scanned and the month during which the exam occurred Results: Overall, 0.9% of mothers reported exposure to one of these types of radiographic exams during the periconceptional period. We observed significant associations between maternal exposure during the first trimester and isolated Dandy‐Walker malformation (odds ratio = 7.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.8–33) and isolated d‐transposition of the great arteries (odds ratio = 3.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.4–10.3). However, the result for isolated Dandy‐Walker malformation was based on only two exposed cases. Conclusion: These results should be interpreted cautiously because multiple statistical tests were conducted and measurements of exposure were based on maternal report. However, our results may be useful for generating hypotheses for future studies.

Leveraging the imaginative and iterative elements of the ideation process, participants engaged in inquiry exploring energy harvesting and novel sensor technology. In modeling the ideation methodology, participants were more engaged in authentic research, which subsequently fostered the creation of novel lesson plans extending beyond the classroom. The importance of research-based, STEM-based RET experiences are a critical feature of bolstering teacher content and pedagogical skills while embedding features of student-centered elements such as creativity and imagination. During the following school year, participating teachers created an inter-district competition designing Ebolavirus sensors using the One Health framework introduced in the summer research experience program. An example of a student product is provided. A discussion of alignment to science curriculum standards as well as the need of these programs are also discussed.","",""

The frequency orthogonality between the received/re-transmitted signals may enable high-performance sensing in severe interference/clutter background. Here, a fully passive, quad-ring frequency multiplier is proposed using graphene field-effect transistors, of which the unique ambipolar charge transports render a frequency doubling effect with conversion gain being chemically sensitive to exposed gas/molecular/chemical/infectious agents.

We tested this proposition in four studies ( N = 1,177). Study 1 used daily-diary methods and indicates that daily perceptions of self-knowledge covary with daily levels of morally valenced behavior. The final three studies made use of experimental methods and demonstrate that thinking about immoral behaviors attenuates current perceptions of self-knowledge.

Based on our findings, we argue that perceived self-knowledge may play a functional role in moral self-concept maintenance and moral regulatory processes.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0146167216665095",""

The storms and their environments were analyzed using single- and dual-Doppler radar, mobile mesonet, deployable surface mesonet, and mobile sounding data, with the goal of understanding why one supercell produced no tornadoes while the other produced at least two. Outflow temperature deficits were similar for the two storms, both within the normal range for weakly tornadic supercells but somewhat cold relative to significantly tornadic supercells. The storms formed in a complex environment, with slightly higher storm-relative helicity near the tornadic supercell. The environment evolved significantly in time, with large thermodynamic changes and increases in storm-relative helicity, leading to conditions much more favorable for tornadogenesis. After a few hours, a new storm developed between the supercells, likely leading to the demise of the nontornadic supercell before it was able to experience the enhanced environmental conditions. Two tornadoes developed within the single mesocyclone of the other supercell. After the dissipation of the second tornado, rapid rearward motion of low- to midlevel circulations may have inhibited further tornado production in this storm.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/MWR-D-15-0345.1",""

We hypothesize that foreign-born doctoral recipients, particularly those who are female and/or non-White, are more likely than their U.S.-born, male, or White counterparts to become a postdoc for reasons not related to professional training and development. Research Design: To explore these hypotheses, we have analyzed individual-level data from the 2006 administration of the U.S. National Science Foundation's Survey of Doctorate Recipients using multinomial logistic regression. Findings/Results: We find that the reasons for working as a postdoc differ by race, foreign-born status, and the interaction of these two factors.

We find that the initial dosing of the barium- or strontium-bis(triisopropylcyclopentadienyl) precursors on a clean Ge surface produces a surface phase that has the same chemical and structural properties as the 0.5-monolayer Ba Zintl layer formed when depositing Ba by molecular beam epitaxy. Similar binding energy shifts are found for Ba, Sr, and Ge when using either chemical or elemental metal sources. The observed germanium surface core level shifts are consistent with the flattening of the initially tilted Ge surface dimers using both molecular and atomic metal sources. Similar binding energy shifts and changes in dimer tilting with alkaline earth metal adsorption are found with density functional theory calculations. High angle angular dark field scanning transmission microscopy images of BaTiO3, SrZrO3, SrHfO3, and SrHf0.55Ti0.45O3 reveal the location of the Ba (or Sr) atomic columns between the Ge dimers. The results imply that the organic ligands dissociate from the precursor after precursor adsorption on the Ge surface, producing the same Zintl template critical for perovskite growth on Group IV semiconductors during molecular beam epitaxy.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.4972071/13397363/052817_1_online.pdf",""

Previously published reports have highlighted the inconsistencies between Social Communication Questionnaire-screening results and formal autism spectrum disorder diagnoses. The variations in accuracy resulted in some researchers questioning the validity of the Social Communication Questionnaire. This study systematically examined the accuracy of the Social Communication Questionnaire as a function of the methodological decisions made by researchers screening for autism spectrum disorder over the last 15 years. Findings from this study suggest that the Social Communication Questionnaire is an acceptable screening instrument for autism spectrum disorder (area under the curve = 0.885). Variations in methodological decisions, however, greatly influenced the accuracy of the Social Communication Questionnaire in screening for autism spectrum disorder. Of these methodological variations, using the Current instead of the Lifetime version of the Social Communication Questionnaire resulted in the largest detrimental effect ( d = −3.898), followed by using the Social Communication Questionnaire with individuals younger than 4 years of age ( d = −2.924) and relying upon convenience samples ( d = −4.828 for clinical samples, −2.734 for convenience samples, and −1.422 for community samples).

The animal transport model is based on the weight and number of animals in each weight category, type of trailer, vehicle, and fuel used. The energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission estimates of animal feed transportation are based on the weight of a truckload and the number of truckloads of feed transported. Our results indicate that a truckload is travelling approximately 326 km in connection with beef cattle production in the study region. The fuel consumption amounts to 24 L of fossil fuel per 1000 kg of boneless beef. The corresponding greenhouse gas emission is 83 kg. It appears from our results that the majority of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions are associated with sending the finished cattle to slaughterhouses and bringing feeder cattle to feedlots.

Methods: The Texas Birth Defects Registry was queried for all live born infants with TGA from 1999 to 2007. Four hundred sixty‐eight cases of TGA were included. Results: Forty‐eight patients (10.3%) were prenatally diagnosed, and 20 patients died before age 28 days (4.3%).

Most changes in chromatin accessibility, scored by DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs), were located in the promoters of genes and transposable elements (TEs). Comparisons between morc1/2 and WT receiving the same treatment revealed differential DHSs (dDHSs) predominantly associated with heterochromatic TEs. By contrast, comparisons between mock- and P. syringae pv. tomato–inoculated plants from the same genotype showed dDHSs associated with biotic and abiotic stress-related genes; a smaller but significant population was in TEs. Moreover, many defense genes, including PR-1, PR-2, and PR-5, were proximal to P. syringae pv. tomato–induced, TE-associated dDHSs. A random subset of these defense genes showed moderately delayed or reduced expression or both in P. syringae pv. tomato–infected morc1/2 as compared with WT. MORC1 was physically bound to chromatin in a P. syringae pv. tomato infection-responsive manner at sites dispersed throughout the genome. Notably, silencing of TE-associated dDHSs proximal to these infection-induced, MORC1-interacting sites led to significant suppression of P. syringae pv. tomato–induced transcription of adjacent defense genes, including PR-1. These results provide evidence that MORC1 is associated with TEs and suggest that a subset of these TEs may help regulate their proximal defense genes.","https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/pdf/10.1094/MPMI-01-16-0023-R",""

However, we know surprisingly little about the genetic mechanisms underlying the locally adapted traits involved in ecotype formation. The genetic architecture underlying locally adapted traits dictates how an organism will respond to environmental selection pressures, and has major implications for evolutionary ecology, conservation, and crop breeding. To understand the genetic architecture underlying the divergence of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) ecotypes, we constructed a genetic mapping population through a four-way outbred cross between two northern upland and two southern lowland accessions. Trait segregation in this mapping population was largely consistent with multiple independent loci controlling the suite of traits that characterizes ecotype divergence. We assembled a joint linkage map using ddRADseq, and mapped quantitative trait loci (QTL) for traits that are divergent between ecotypes, including flowering time, plant size, physiological processes, and disease resistance. Overall, we found that most QTL had small to intermediate effects. While we identified colocalizing QTL for multiple traits, we did not find any large-effect QTL that clearly controlled multiple traits through pleiotropy or tight physical linkage. These results indicate that ecologically important traits in switchgrass have a complex genetic basis, and that similar loci may underlie divergence across the geographic range of the ecotypes.","http://academic.oup.com/g3journal/article-pdf/6/11/3561/37185109/g3journal3561.pdf",""

Building on prior interview-based and experimental research, we provide an engagement-level analysis of challenging FVMs, using quantitative and qualitative data on audit phases from risk assessment to booking adjustments. Challenging FVMs have high estimation uncertainty, high subjectivity, significant/complex assumptions, and multiple valuation techniques. Estimation uncertainty is associated with higher inherent risk assessments, which are, in turn, predictive of client problems identified during the engagement. The use of a valuation specialist by auditors, associated with higher inherent risk and client specialist use, is a key decision: procedures performed by specialists have the highest yield in identifying problems. Auditor-client discussion of an adjustment increases with problem identification and auditors' expressions of residual concern about uncertainty post-testing. However, booked audit adjustments are infrequent; the only factors explaining income-decreasing adjustments are better evidential support and breadth of problems identified.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article-pdf/92/4/81/35478/accr-51569.pdf",""

We first examine how heterogeneity among healthcare practitioners (HPs) (in terms of their expected benefit from the HIE membership) affects participation of HPs in HIEs. We find that, under certain conditions, low-gain HPs choose not to join HIEs. Hence, we explore several measures that can encourage more participation in these networks and find that it might be beneficial to (i) establish a second HIE in the region, (ii) propose more value to the low-gain HPs, or (iii) offer or incentivize value-added services. We present several other interesting and useful results that are somewhat counterintuitive.

Furthermore, since the amount of funds from the government and the other agencies often changes (and will eventually cease), we analyze how the changes in the benefit HPs obtain from the HIE affect (i) participation in the network, (ii) the HIE subscription fee and the fee for value-added service, (iii) the number of HPs that request value-added service, and (iv) the net values of the HIE provider and HPs.

ESDs have many advantages over traditional surgical tools including reduced blood loss, improved efficiency and lower surgeon fatigue. However, these devices suffer from tissue sticking and damage due to overheating which leads to poor tissue joint quality. The problem is potentially caused by uneven power distribution due to non-uniform compression applied by the bipolar forceps. In this study, the effect of compression force uniformity was investigated with an experimental setup to achieve a uniform and consistent compression force at the jaws of bipolar forceps. Comparative tissue welding experiments were conducted under both uniform and non-uniform compression force conditions with tissue mimicking material. In situ welding process parameters including compression force, electrical voltage, and current were collected and analyzed to understand the effect of compression force uniformity. Comparing the uniform to non-uniform compression force cases, the results indicate that tissue impedance is lower due to increased tissue contact area; the electrical power is initially higher during the first few milliseconds, but becomes lower for the rest of the welding process recorded. The experimental device developed in this study provides an important platform to understand the difference of tissue welding process under uniform and non-uniform compression force conditions.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/MSEC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/MSEC2016-8731/4425287/v002t03a010-msec2016-8731.pdf",""

We show this choice is affected by not only how many delinquent peers an individual directly and indirectly connects with, but also who those peers are. Specifically, exposure to delinquent peers is not universally risky, and could even be protective if the average exposure level of the individual’s delinquent peers is significantly less than her own exposure level. In addition, we show that individuals with high exposure levels are more sensitive to structural changes in the delinquent network.

We define knowledge internalization as the process in which an individual relies on various cognitive mechanisms to transform his or her declarative knowledge into actionable procedural knowledge. Analyzing data collected from 259 knowledge workers, we found that knowledge internalization is a second‐order formative construct comprising organization and structure, mental models, efficiency, automaticity, and metacognition dimensions. The effect of knowledge internalization on intention to share knowledge is fully mediated by expert power and knowledge self‐efficacy. The effect of knowledge internalization on expert power is partially mediated by knowledge self‐efficacy. This study contributes to the literature by offering an elaborated construct of knowledge internalization and establishing its nomological validity in the knowledge sharing phenomenon.

Despite the use of Spanish-language songs and attention to the mariachi genre in US music education programs, conjunto music is often ignored. In order to provide equal educational rights to all students regardless of native tongue, a socially just music education curriculum needs to include Mexican Americans’ language, culture, and musical practices so that they are held in the same regard as other musics. This chapter examines the role of conjunto as a vital part of Mexican American students’ musical and cultural identities and offers suggestions for its inclusion in the music curriculum.","https://academic.oup.com/edited-volume/28105/chapter/212237047",""

The distribution of these so‐called synonymous codons among protein coding sequences is not random and multiple theories have arisen to explain the biological significance of such non‐uniform codon selection. Many ideas revolve around the notion that certain codons allow for faster or more efficient translation, whereas the presence of others result in slower translation rates. The presence of these different types of codons along a message is postulated in turn to confer variable rates of emergence of the nascent polypeptide from the ribosome, which may influence its capacity to fold towards the native state, among other properties. Previous studies have reported conflicting results with regards to whether certain kinds of codons correlate or not with particular structural or folding properties of the encoded protein. We believe this has arisen, in part, because different criteria have been traditionally used for predicting whether a codon will be translated quickly or slowly in a given organism, including its frequency of occurrence among highly expressed genes and the concentration of tRNA species capable of decoding it, which do not always correlate. We have developed a metric to predict organism‐specific polypeptide elongation rates of any mRNA based on whether each codon is decoded by tRNAs capable of Watson‐Crick, non‐Watson‐Crick or both types of interactions.

We consider the problem of detecting GXE where G is a rare haplotype and E is a nongenetic factor. Such methods typically assume G-E independence, which may not hold in many applications. A pertinent example is lung cancer—there is evidence that variants on Chromosome 15q25.1 interact with smoking to affect the risk. However, these variants are associated with smoking behavior rendering the assumption of G-E independence inappropriate. With the motivation of detecting GXE under G-E dependence, we extend an existing approach, logistic Bayesian LASSO, which assumes G-E independence (LBL-GXE-I) by modeling G-E dependence through a multinomial logistic regression (referred to as LBL-GXE-D). Unlike LBL-GXE-I, LBL-GXE-D controls type I error rates in all situations; however, it has reduced power when G-E independence holds. To control type I error without sacrificing power, we further propose a unified approach, LBL-GXE, to incorporate uncertainty in the G-E independence assumption by employing a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo method. Our simulations show that LBL-GXE has power similar to that of LBL-GXE-I when G-E independence holds, yet has well-controlled type I errors in all situations. To illustrate the utility of LBL-GXE, we analyzed a lung cancer dataset and found several significant interactions in the 15q25.1 region, including one between a specific rare haplotype and smoking.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fbiom.12567",""

Researchers also began to focus on these systems by exploring their implementation and effectiveness; despite such advances in the literature, however, a noticeable gap persists. Specifically, much of the research focuses on the technology rather than the users themselves. Conducted at a large southwestern university, the present study sought to narrow this void by examining the perceptions and employment of the system by a key group of users – faculty and staff members – who often are considered the first line of defense in emergencies on campus. The findings not only highlight the continued need for multimodal notification systems, but also better education and training with relation to their use to increase user engagement and improve overall operations. Limitations of the study, directions for future research, and related policy implications for universities also are discussed.","http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/jhsem.2016.13.issue-3/jhsem-2016-0047/jhsem-2016-0047.xml",""

The Sand Shinnery Oak Prairie ecoregion of the Southern High Plains of New Mexico and Texas is environmentally isolated, warmer, and more arid than the Short-Grass, Sand Sagebrush, and Mixed-Grass Prairie ecoregions in Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and the northeast panhandle of Texas. Weather is known to influence Lesser Prairie-Chicken nest survival in the Sand Shinnery Oak Prairie ecoregion; regional variation may also influence nest microclimate and, ultimately, survival during incubation. To address this question, we placed data loggers adjacent to nests during incubation to quantify temperature and humidity distribution functions in 3 ecoregions. We developed a suite of a priori nest survival models that incorporated derived microclimate parameters and visual obstruction as covariates in Program MARK. We monitored 49 nests in Mixed-Grass, 22 nests in Sand Shinnery Oak, and 30 nests in Short-Grass ecoregions from 2010 to 2014. Our findings indicated that (1) the Sand Shinnery Oak Prairie ecoregion was hotter and drier during incubation than the Mixed- and Short-Grass ecoregions; (2) nest microclimate varied among years within ecoregions; (3) visual obstruction was positively associated with nest survival; but (4) daily nest survival probability decreased by 10% every half-hour when temperature was greater than 34°C and vapor pressure deficit was less than −23 mmHg during the day (about 0600–2100 hours). Our major finding confirmed microclimate thresholds for nest survival under natural conditions across the species' distribution, although Lesser Prairie-Chickens are more likely to experience microclimate conditions that result in nest failures in the Sand Shinnery Oak Prairie ecoregion. The species would benefit from identification of thermal landscapes and management actions that promote cooler, more humid nest microclimates.","http://academic.oup.com/condor/article-pdf/118/4/728/28237042/condor0728.pdf",""

We report a CO vibrational branching ratio of 0.79:0.21 for v = 0:v = 1, indicating substantially higher vibrational excitation than that observed at slightly longer wavelengths. The CO rotational distribution is bimodal for both v = 0 and v = 1, although the bimodality is less pronounced than at longer wavelengths. Vector correlations, including rotational alignment, indicate that absorption to both the 21A′ (A) and 11A″ (B) states is important in the lower-j part of the rotational distribution, while only 21A′ state absorption contributes to the upper part; this conclusion is consistent with work at longer wavelengths. Classical trajectory calculations including surface hopping reproduce the measured CO rotational distributions and their dependence on wavelength well, though they underestimate the v = 1 population. The calculations indicate that the higher-j peak in the rotational distribution arises from molecules that begin on the 21A′ state but make nonadiabatic transitions to the 11A′ (X) state during the dissociation, while the lower-j peak arises from direct photodissociation on either the 21A′ or the 11A″ states, as found in previous work.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.4955189/15515149/024310_1_online.pdf",""

Research links parental sensitivity and cognitive stimulation to child language, but has not explicitly contrasted their effects, nor examined how effects may change over time. We examined maternal sensitivity and stimulation throughout infancy using two observational methods—ratings of parents’ interaction qualities and coding of discrete parenting behaviors—to assess the relative importance of these qualities to child vocabulary over time and determine whether mothers make related changes in response to children's development. Participants were 146 infants and mothers, assessed when infants were 14, 24, and 36 months. At 14 months, sensitivity had a stronger effect on vocabulary than did stimulation, but the effect of stimulation grew throughout toddlerhood. Mothers’ cognitive stimulation grew over time, whereas sensitivity remained stable. While discrete parenting behaviors changed with child age, there was no evidence of trade‐offs between sensitive and stimulating behaviors, and no evidence that sensitivity moderated the effect of stimulation on child vocabulary. Findings demonstrate specificity of timing in the link between parenting qualities and child vocabulary, which could inform early parent interventions, and support a reconceptualization of the nature and measurement of parental sensitivity.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Finfa.12147",""

However, due to anisotropic properties, high stiffness, and high abrasiveness of carbon fibers in carbon fiber–reinforced plastic, high cutting force, high tool wear, and high surface roughness are always caused in conventional machining processes. This article reports an investigation using rotary ultrasonic machining in surface grinding of carbon fiber–reinforced plastic composites in order to develop an effective and high-quality surface grinding process. In rotary ultrasonic machining surface grinding of carbon fiber–reinforced plastic composites, tool selection is of great importance since tool variables will significantly affect output variables. In this work, the effects of tool variables, including abrasive size, abrasive concentration, number of slots, and tool end geometry, on machining performances, including the cutting force, torque, and surface roughness, are experimentally studied. The results show that lower cutting forces and torque are generated by the tool with higher abrasive size, lower abrasive concentration, and two slots. Lower surface roughness is generated by the tool with smaller abrasive size, smaller abrasive concentration, two slots, and convex end geometry. This investigation will provide guides for tool selections during rotary ultrasonic machining surface grinding of carbon fiber–reinforced plastic composites.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1687814016670284",""

A percolation theoretical treatment of nonreactive solute transport that was previously shown compatible with the scaling of chemical weathering rates is here shown to be compatible with soil formation rates, and with C and N sequestration rates in the soil as well. In this theoretical framework, the percolation backbone fractal dimensionality, which generates the long‐time tail of the solute arrival time distribution, also predicts the scaling of the reaction rates, while laboratory proportionality to the fluid flow velocity translates to an analogous relevance of the vertical infiltration rate in the field. The predicted proportionality of solute transport to net infiltration generates simultaneously the variability in soil formation rates across 4 orders of magnitude of precipitation and 12 orders of magnitude of time scales.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2F2016WR019289",""

Although OST emphasizes both social exchange and self-enhancement processes, most accounts of POS’s effects are rooted in social exchange. For example, POS’s linkages with commitment and retention have been explained as an exchange of support for positive attitudes and continued employment. This research sheds light on self-enhancement’s less-understood role in fostering these reactions by demonstrating the influence of social comparison effects. Drawing on a sample of 342 employees nested in 82 work-units of a US hospitality company, our analysis demonstrates that favorable POS comparisons with peers in one’s work-unit are positively associated with commitment and retention, whereas unfavorable comparisons are negatively related. Results also show that comparisons taking place in less-supported work-units have stronger impact than comparisons made in those with better support. Our findings extend OST by revealing the importance of social comparisons in engendering responses to organizational support, and in so doing potentially explicate the differential ways social exchange and self-enhancement operate with regard to POS.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0018726715619687",""

The goals of civil society require a reliance on democratic values, and active participation is necessary for a strong civil society that demands the common good be deliberated in democratic ways. Discussion as pedagogy has been advanced for furthering democratic learning spaces in higher education with adults and in teacher education programs. Opportunities to participate in democratic discussions may also be created in online courses to prepare students who are literate in multiculturalism and an inclusive society. Engaging students in discussion that facilitates diverse perspectives and that challenges taken-for-granted assumptions is necessary. Purpose: This article explores the theoretical frameworks of a pedagogy of process called a Socrates Café, resulting in a typology for an online Socrates Café. This framework may assist instructors to create and sustain purposeful online discussion forums that engage students in deliberative discussion to develop democratic learning spaces and civil discourse. If democratic pedagogies are enhanced when people deliberate in online discussions by sharing their reasoning with each other, listening to competing points of view, considering new evidence, and treating one another as political equals, then the Socrates Café has much to offer as a pedagogical process. Research Design: Drawing on scholarship from key pedagogical and dispositional components, this analytical essay offers a typology that finds its theoretical roots in several areas, including: philosophical forum, discussion and dialogue, critical inquiry, habits of mind, intellectual traits, critical reflection, and civil discourse. Findings/Results: From both the pedagogical and dispositional components of the Socrates Café, we develop an integrative framework for guiding the creation and ongoing development of an online discussion. Our purpose in creating the framework was to determine those pedagogical and attitudinal dispositions that were foundational elements of the online Socrates Café: clarity of thinking and other habits of mind; attitudes of empathy, confidence, open mindedness and scholarliness; and questioning and dialogue. Conclusions/Recommendations: This essay concludes that the online Socrates Café is fraught with unavoidable contradictions resulting in a pedagogy of process that is negotiated and dynamic, but also purposeful and intentional. The integrative framework proposed in this work assists students to examine who they are as scholars, practitioners, and members of a democratic society. The inherent tensions between the competing values that situate the Socrates Café make it a complex pedagogy that invites students to encounter issues that surpass the self and connect them with larger societal problems, enhancing the potential for discussions that are purposeful and result in an expansion of perspectives. Supporting students as they negotiate these and other contradictions and paradoxes in a functional Socrates Café has immense potential for facilitating democratic spaces in pedagogy for civil discourse.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/016146811611800501",""

This study addresses the need to understand the relative contributions of these predictors to readers’ comprehension of multiple texts and the processes used by readers to make sense of texts. Eighty‐three students (grades 5–7) participated in this mixed‐methods study. The sample consisted of monolingual students and emergent and proficient bilingual students who completed measures of expository comprehension, strategic knowledge and awareness, English‐language proficiency, prior content knowledge, and epistemic beliefs. Ten bilingual students from this sample also completed a think‐aloud protocol to allow for close examination of their meaning‐making processes. In a multiple regression analysis, English‐language proficiency was the strongest predictor of comprehension, followed by content knowledge. Strategy knowledge and awareness and epistemic beliefs were not related to multiple‐text comprehension in the model. The relationship between English‐language proficiency and comprehension was stronger for bilingual students than for monolingual students. Students in the think‐aloud sample demonstrated emergent knowledge of processes of disciplinary reading of multiple texts, including metacognitive monitoring, theorizing authorial identity, and intertextual integration, while also displaying a tendency to defer to institutionalized authority when evaluating credibility of the texts. The findings provide directions for future research on the way young adolescents comprehend and learn from expository texts in the discipline of science.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Frrq.162",""

Results suggest that fish communities varied both spatially and temporally from 1976 to 2008, with greater temporal shifts in habitats more proximate to the Gulf of Mexico and removed from human residential areas — diversity increased in Powderhorn Lake and spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus (Cuvier, 1830)) and red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus (L., 1766)) abundances increased in Oyster Lake following changes in fishing regulations. Natural fluctuations in environmental conditions coupled with limited access to lakes by geographic restraints may have led to more pronounced changes in community structure. However, the effects of fishing management on fish communities within small lakes and bays within the Lavaca–Colorado Estuary is likely habitat- and context-specific, and continued monitoring, especially among ecologically and economically important species, will provide insight into how environmental change and anthropogenic disturbance may affect long-term trends in coastal community composition.","http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/full-xml/10.1139/cjz-2016-0079",""

Additionally, we examined whether predictive validity of DA would be higher for students who have poor phonological awareness skills. First-grade students ( n = 105) were assessed on measures of word reading, phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming, and DA in the fall and again assessed on word reading measures in the spring. A series of planned, moderated multiple regression analyses indicated that DA made a significant and unique contribution in predicting word recognition development above and beyond the autoregressor, particularly for students with poor phonological awareness skills. For these students, DA explained 3.5% of the unique variance in end-of-first-grade word recognition that was not attributable to autoregressive effect.

In addition, this positive effect for low‐intrinsic‐interest employees was achieved only when these employees interpreted the job requirement as important either because performance‐reward expectancy was high or because perceived value for the organization was high.

A few strategies involved in managing Big Data in health system pharmacy include identifying potential opportunities for Big Data, prioritizing those opportunities, protecting privacy concerns, promoting data transparency, and communicating outcomes. As health care information expands in its content and becomes more integrated, Big Data can enhance the development of patient-centered pharmacy services.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1310/hpj5107-599",""

Management of R. solani AG 1-IA, the causal agent of sheath blight in rice (Oryza sativa), using biofumigation, is promising but needs more validation. Biofumigation activity of nine Brassicaceae plants and two other related species were evaluated in vitro with soils from Texas, Arkansas, or Mississippi. All plants evaluated significantly suppressed the mycelium growth of R. solani AG 1-IA. Mustard (Brassica juncea) cultivars (‘Brand 199’, ‘Ruby Streak’, ‘Florida Broadleaf’, and ‘Green Wave’) consistently provided the greatest (>90%) mycelial inhibition, while sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea) and Chinese cabbage (B. rapa) had the least suppressive effect. B. juncea ‘Red Giant’ and ‘Sheali Hong’, turnip (B. rapa), kale (B. oleracea), and arugula (Eruca sativa) showed intermediate efficacy or were inconsistent.

A general workflow that combines geophysics, geology, and geomechanics (3G) was evaluated and applied to the well. The benefits of the 3G workflow are threefold. First, the quantitative impact of the NFs on the regional stress is provided through the differential horizontal stress variation, which impacts fracturing complexity. Then, the reservoir strain map, validated with microseismic data, gives insights into the stimulated drainage pathways. Finally, the ability of the [Formula: see text] integral to predict poor hydraulic fracturing stages as a function of fracture density along the wellbore or as a function of the energy required to propagate a fracture. Building on the validated 3G workflow, a well placement workflow that takes into account the quantitative impact of NFs on well performance was developed on the sample Wolfcamp well. By comparing the [Formula: see text] integral of the same completion stage in simulations with and without NFs, stages with similar [Formula: see text] integral values in both simulations were identified as those not being affected by the NF network. This allows the workflow to provide the optimal position of a well in the presence of NFs associated with a complex fault system that may produce undesirable water. The result is a validated 3G workflow that provides a geomechanical explanation for an empirical relationship showing that high oil production is achieved within a “Goldilocks” range of natural fracturing.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/INT-2015-0134.1",""

From 2006 to 2009, the car business undertook 2,121 quality improvement initiatives at these suppliers, while the commercial vehicles business did not undertake any such initiatives. We find that the quality knowledge developed through the quality improvement initiatives undertaken by the car business does not easily spill over to benefit the commercial vehicles business. Quality knowledge spills over under three conditions: (1) when quality improvement efforts are focused on organizational members, as opposed to when they focus on routines or technology; (2) when quality improvement efforts focus on the output activities of suppliers, not when they focus on the input or in-process activities; and (3) when quality knowledge is developed at suppliers with low complexity in their operations.

The biological profile consists of estimates of sex, age, ancestry, and stature. It is crucial to have a correct estimate of sex, as this designation will narrow down the search through missing persons reports by half (e.g., searching through NamUs). However, sex estimates can be population specific, necessitating accurate ancestry estimation. When estimates of age and stature are added, the search narrows further. If these estimates are incorrect, the unidentified human remains may never be identified. These biological profile components are estimated based on either metric or nonmetric methods (visual observation and recording of categorical data). While age is inherently nonmetric, stature is inherently metric. Estimates of sex and ancestry can take a metric or nonmetric approach. The purpose of this review article is to review metric methods in forensic anthropology (sex, ancestry, and stature), to provide general knowledge of why and how these metric methods work, and to highlight that estimates of sex, ancestry, and stature do not subscribe to a “one size fits all” model.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.23907/2016.040",""

Among the changes that are occurring is the possibility of integrating Internet resources into curricula, which are often linked to mandated standards in schools in the USA and other countries. Among the many possibilities of leveraging these classrooms is the concept of flipping the classroom so that primary presentations of content take place outside the classroom, with classroom activities focused on practice, interaction and feedback. To make a flipped classroom successful requires training teachers about technology integration, providing ongoing professional development, and developing supportive school and home environments with strong educational leadership.

Wearables are generally composed of hardware/software components for collection, processing, and communication of physiological data. Practical implementation of wearable monitoring in real-life applications is currently limited due to notable obstacles. The wearability and form factor are dominated by the amount of energy needed for sensing, processing, and communication. In this article, we propose an ultra-low-power granular decision-making architecture, also called screening classifier, which can be viewed as a tiered wake-up circuitry, consuming three orders of magnitude-less power than the state-of-the-art low-power microcontrollers. This processing model operates based on computationally simple template matching modules, based on coarse- to fine-grained analysis of the signals with on-demand and gradually increasing the processing power consumption. Initial template matching rejects signals that are clearly not of interest from the signal processing chain, keeping the rest of processing blocks idle. If the signal is likely of interest, the sensitivity and the power of the template matching modules are gradually increased, and ultimately, the main processing unit is activated. We pose optimization techniques to efficiently split a full template into smaller bins, called mini-templates, and activate only a subset of bins during each classification decision. Our experimental results on real data show that this signal screening model reduces power consumption of the processing architecture by a factor of 70% while the sensitivity of detection remains at least 80%.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2886096",""

Serially measured heights (0.1 cm), sitting heights (0.1 cm), weights (0.1 kg), and estimated leg lengths (0.1 cm) from 8 to 18 years were used. Predicted age at PHV (years) was calculated as the difference between chronological age (CA) and maturity offset. Actual age at PHV for each child was derived with a triple logistic model (Bock-Thissen-du Toit). Mean predicted maturity offset was negative and lowest at 8 years and increased linearly with increasing CA. Predicted ages at PHV increased linearly with CA from 8 to 18 years in girls and from 8 to 13 years in boys; predictions varied within relatively narrow limits from 12 to 15 years and then increased to 18 years in boys. Differences between predicted and actual ages at PHV among youth of contrasting maturity status were significant across the age range in both sexes.

Yet research supporting this connection in today's transitional societies is scarce and somewhat contradictory, and it is unclear how other marital traditions, such as consanguineous marriage, shape this relationship. This study evaluates Goode's theorized connection using pooled Demographic and Health Survey data from Turkey, comparing children ever born, use of contraception, and parity progression across four types of marriage: own‐choice and arranged marriage and marriage to a cousin versus an unrelated spouse. Results are largely consistent with the idea that a move toward own‐choice marriage reflects a widening repertoire of choice that also leads to fertility decline.

The primary outcome, mortality, was assessed beginning at the second interview in 1995 until the fifth interview in 2005. Medications were classified for anticholinergic burden according to the modified‐Anticholinergic Drug Scale and were summed across all reported medications creating a measure of total anticholinergic burden.

Survival analysis showed a statistically significant ( Conclusions: Anticholinergic burden is associated with increased mortality in Southwestern Mexican American older adults who report taking prescription or non prescription medications.

Despite impressive methodological and computational advances, ecological forecasting still suffers from poor resolutions of environmental data. Published data comprise relatively few layers of surface climate and suffer from coarse temporal resolution. Hence, models using these data might underestimate heterogeneity of microclimates and miss biological consequences of climatic extremes. Moreover, we currently lack predictions about vegetation cover in future environments, a key factor for estimating the spatial heterogeneity of microclimates and hence the capacity for behavioral thermoregulation. Here, we describe microclimates and vegetation for the past and the future at spatial and temporal resolutions of 36 km (approximately 0.3°) and 1 h, respectively. We used the Weather Research and Forecasting model to downscale published, bias‐corrected predictions of a global‐circulation model from a resolution of 0.9° latitude and 1.25° longitude (approximately 100 km in latitude and 130 km in longitude). Output from this model was used as input for a microclimate model, which generated temperatures and wind speeds for 1980–1999 and 2080–2099 at various heights, as well as soil temperatures at various depths and shade intensities. We also predicted the percentage of green vegetation and the percentage of shade given the angle of the sun. These data were evaluated using several criteria, each of which shed light on a different aspect of value to researchers. The metadata describe the modeling protocol, microclimate calculations, computer programs, and the evaluation process.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fecy.1444",""

To address these issues, we propose an integrative framework of crises and crisis management that draws from research in strategy, organizational theory, and organizational behavior as well as from research in public relations and corporate communication. We identify two primary perspectives in the literature, one focused on the internal dynamics of a crisis and one focused on managing external stakeholders. We review core concepts from each perspective and highlight the commonalities that exist between them. Finally, we use our integrative framework to propose future research directions for scholars interested in crises and crisis management.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0149206316680030",""

However, how activated neutrophils regulate CFTR channel distribution subcellularly is not well defined. To investigate, we tested multiple Abs against different CFTR domains, to examine CFTR expression in human peripheral blood neutrophils by flow cytometry. The data confirmed that resting neutrophils had pronounced CFTR expression. Activation of neutrophils with soluble or particulate agonists did not significantly increase CFTR expression level, but induced CFTR redistribution to cell surface. Such CFTR mobilization correlated with cell-surface recruitment of formyl-peptide receptor during secretory vesicle exocytosis. Intriguingly, neutrophils from patients with ΔF508-CF, despite expression of the mutant CFTR, showed little cell-surface mobilization upon stimulation. Although normal neutrophils effectively targeted CFTR to their phagosomes, ΔF508-CF neutrophils had impairment in that process, resulting in deficient hypochlorous acid production.

Soil moisture is frequently used for drought monitoring and climate forecasting. However, in situ soil moisture observations are not systematically archived and there are relatively few national soil moisture networks. The lack of observed soil moisture data makes it difficult to characterize long-term soil moisture variability and trends. The North American Soil Moisture Database (NASMD) is a new high-quality observational soil moisture database. It includes over 1,800 monitoring stations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, making it the largest collections of in situ soil moisture observations in North America. Data are collected from multiple sources, quality controlled, and integrated into an online database (soilmoisture.tamu.edu). Here we describe the development of the database, including quality control/quality assurance, standardization, and collection of metadata. The utility of the NASMD is demonstrated through an analysis of the inter- and intraannual variability of soil moisture from multiple networks. The NASMD is a useful tool for drought monitoring and forecasting, calibrating/validating satellites and land surface models, and documenting how soil moisture influences the climate system on seasonal to interannual time scales.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/bams/article-pdf/97/8/1441/3746899/bams-d-13-00263_1.pdf",""

Accordingly, the focus in recommender system research is generally on making better predictions of users' ratings. In contrast, we focus on better utilizing these rating estimates in the operations of DVD‐rental firms. We show that a more explicit consideration of inventory level and future demand can help the firms better manage demand, and can increase the number of satisfied customers substantially. However, if the uncertainty regarding inventory levels is high, the performance of one of our proposed approaches may be worse than the prevalent industry practice under certain conditions. We discuss these conditions and propose a quick recipe for dealing with high levels of variation in inventory estimation. We show that when it is not possible to estimate inventory levels reliably, it is better to underestimate rather than overestimate. Other findings include the trade‐off between the short‐term profitability of the firms and long‐term customer trust; and the effect of variation in rating estimates on the quality of our solution approaches.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/poms.12540",""

Thermoplastics are currently used as common feedstocks to fabricate prototypes in FDM process. However, FDM-fabricated pure thermoplastic parts cannot be used as load-bearing parts in the actual applications due to their limited tensile strength. Such condition could be improved by developing carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) composites using FDM for potential industrial end users. It is crucial that proper selections of FDM process parameters during fabricating CFRP composite parts could ensure the part quality and properties. However, the effects of FDM process parameters on the tensile properties of CFRP composites have not been explored. In this paper, CFRP composite specimens with 5 wt% carbon fiber content were fabricated using a FDM machine. Tensile testing was conducted to obtain the tensile properties.

Theorizing power dynamics as relational, we use dialectic configurations between actors as independent variables determining network measures as outcomes. Our goal is to assess relational power granted to candidates through Twitter conversations about them and whether they change depending on the gender of their opponent. Based on more than a quarter of a million tweets about 50 candidates for state-wide offices during the 2014 US elections, results suggest that when a woman opposes a man, the conversation revolves around her, but she retains a smaller portion of rhetorical share. We find that gender affects network structure—women candidates are both more central and more replied to when they run against men. Despite the potential for social media to disrupt deeply rooted gender bias, our findings suggest that the structure of networked discussions about male and female candidates still results in a differential distribution of relational power.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2056305116664218",""

Meta-analysis has failed to determine moderators that govern the link between advertising and firm value.

Advertising cannot build brand equity for a cost leader because such a firm has no point of difference on which to build. Identifying differentiators and cost leaders on the basis of firms’ reactions to a change in accounting regulations, the authors confirm hypotheses: advertising is related to sales for all firms, but it is more strongly related to firm value for differentiators than for cost leaders. Beyond explaining differences in advertising effectiveness, this study's indicator of differentiation versus cost leadership should enhance future analyses of marketing's effect on firm-level outcomes using archival financial data.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1509/jmr.13.0285",""

Having propensity for local and distant recurrence, it poses a diagnostic dilemma secondary to pathologic complexity. Patients have dismal prognosis due to lack of effective therapy. HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) exhibit marked antitumor effects in various malignancies. The studies here demonstrate that pan-HDAC inhibitors constitute novel therapeutics versus epithelioid sarcoma. Human ES cells (VAESBJ, HS-ES, Epi-544) were studied in preclinical models to evaluate HDACi effects. Immunoblot and RT-PCR were used to evaluate expression of acetylated tubulin, histones H3/H4, EZH2 upon HDACi. MTS and clonogenic assays were used to assess the impact of HDACi on cell growth. Cell culture assays were used to evaluate the impact of HDACi and EZH2-specific siRNA inhibition on cell-cycle progression and survival. Unbiased gene array analysis was used to identify the impact of HDACi on epithelioid sarcoma gene expression. Xenografts were used to evaluate epithelioid sarcoma tumor growth in response to HDACi. HDAC inhibition increased target protein acetylation and abrogated cell growth and colony formation in epithelioid sarcoma cells. HDACi induced G2 cell-cycle arrest and marked apoptosis, and reduced tumor growth in xenograft models. HDACi induced widespread gene expression changes, and EZH2 was significantly downregulated. EZH2 knockdown resulted in abrogated cell growth in vitro.","https://aacrjournals.org/mcr/article-pdf/14/1/35/2181529/35.pdf",""

Optimal integrated scheduling of gasoline blending and order delivery operations can significantly increase profit by avoiding ship demurrage, improving customer satisfaction, minimizing quality give‐aways, reducing costly transitions and slop generation, exploiting low‐quality cuts, and reducing inventory costs. In this article, we first introduce a new unit‐specific event‐based continuous‐time formulation for the integrated treatment of recipes, blending, and scheduling of gasoline blending and order delivery operations. Many operational features are included such as nonidentical parallel blenders, constant blending rate, minimum blend length and amount, blender transition times, multipurpose product tanks, changeovers, and piecewise constant profiles for blend component qualities and feed rates. To address the nonconvexities arising from forcing constant blending rates during a run, we propose a hybrid global optimization approach incorporating a schedule adjustment procedure, iteratively via a mixed‐integer programming and nonlinear programming scheme, and a rigorous deterministic global optimization approach. The computational results demonstrate that our proposed formulation does improve the mixed‐integer linear programming relaxation of Li and Karimi, Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., 2011, 50, 9156–9174.

Herein, we demonstrate that short‐range fluid flow due to overpressure in marine sediments is a significant additional methane transport mechanism that allows hydrate to precipitate in large quantities in thick, coarse‐grained hydrate reservoirs. Two‐dimensional simulations demonstrate that this migration mechanism, short‐range advective transport, can supply significant amounts of dissolved gas and is unencumbered by limitations of the other two end‐member mechanisms. Short‐range advective migration can increase the amount of methane delivered to sands as compared to the slow process of diffusion, yet it is not necessarily limited by effective porosity reduction as is typical of updip advection from a deep source.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2F2016GL070096",""

Ocean models and observations of submarine termini suggest that plumes enhance melt and undercutting, leading to calving and potential glacier destabilization. Here we systematically evaluate how simulated plume structure and submarine melt during summer months depends on realistic ranges of subglacial discharge, glacier depth, and ocean stratification from 12 Greenland fjords. Our results show that grounding line depth is a strong control on plume‐induced submarine melt: deep glaciers produce warm, salty subsurface plumes that undercut termini, and shallow glaciers produce cold, fresh surface‐trapped plumes that can overcut termini. Due to sustained upwelling velocities, plumes in cold, shallow fjords can induce equivalent depth‐averaged melt rates compared to warm, deep fjords. These results detail a direct ocean‐ice feedback that can affect the Greenland Ice Sheet.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2F2016GL070170",""

The impact of modularity on new product introduction performance, however, may vary for different levels of product and process complexity. This study empirically investigates relationships between perceptual measures of product modularity, process modularity, and new product introduction performance and explores whether an objective product/process complexity measure moderates these relationships. Using survey‐based methodology we probe both manufacturers of technically simple products and technically complex products. Hierarchical regression models are used to test hypotheses concerning the main effects of product and process modularity and the effects of their interactions with complexity on new product introduction performance. The results show that the main effect of product modularity was positive and its interaction with complexity was disordinal and negative, suggesting that the positive effect of product modularity on new product introduction performance is dampened when complexity is high. For process modularity, only the interaction effect (positive) was statistically significant and it was also disordinal in nature. Thus, the effect of process modularity on new product introduction performance is heightened when complexity is high. The implications of these findings are discussed and more specific theoretical and managerial implications are delineated by examining the impacts of these main and interaction effects on individual measures of new product introduction performance (frequency of new product introduction, product development lead times, product innovation, and on‐time product launch).","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/poms.12495",""

The protocol was developed to facilitate the process of electronically referring patients to a state-funded quitline service by establishing a one-click connect for providers to use within the EMR system. While evaluating the implementation of the protocol, findings indicate that several barriers were encountered including disruption of clinic workflow, EMR limitations, and training complications. In spite of the barriers, the protocol shows promising results by increasing referrals to the quitline from 7 patients the year prior to implementation to 1,254 patients after the implementation of the electronic solution. Health care systems that have the ability to modify their EMR system can help lower tobacco use rates among their patients while meeting Meaningful Use requirements. Future research should examine if referrals through the eTobacco protocol are directly associated with patients’ tobacco cessation rates.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1524839916643910",""

We interview people who are avid participants of music-based subcultures. Findings reveal that subcultural antagonism and identity politics are the two factors guiding fragmentation into subcultures in contemporary society. People seek solace in membership in multiple subcultures since each subculture provides a distinct escape from different oppressions perceived in the mainstream. This cultivates the impetus for fragmentation within subcultures. Subcultural fragmentation is voluntary, resistive, and subversive. The constant fragmentation and the multiplicity and fluidity of subcultural memberships give rise to what we call a radical subcultural mosaic referring to eclectic subcultural affiliation and composite subcultural memberships fermenting presentational discourses of resistance. Members of the radical subcultural mosaic seek agency and collectivity, creativity in heterogeneity, and propose novel alternative modes of living.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1469540516668225",""

Impacted vehicles are classified into three categories of upset motions (no movement, lateral shifting, rolling and lofting motions) for each wind intensity category of the Fujita and Enhanced Fujita scales. Vehicles observed by Schmidlin exposed to F1 and F2 winds are statistically assessed to determine if upset distribution values are consistent with those assessed by Marshall at these respective wind speeds; this same approach is subsequently conducted for vehicles at F3/EF3 and F4/EF4 winds. No statistical differences are found between the two sets of field survey data, which are therefore considered to be of the same population.

The results of this study may potentially serve as a basis for providing better tornado safety protocols, designing safer vehicles and infrastructure, and estimating tornado wind speeds where few EF-scale damage indicators are available.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/wcas/article-pdf/8/1/85/4623203/wcas-d-15-0051_1.pdf",""

We argue that when an organization offers a product from a stigmatized category, it is subject to lower evaluations and higher penalties from the stigmatizing audience, regardless of its true underlying quality. Further, when an organization is perceived as increasing its engagement in a stigmatized category, the lower evaluations transfer to the organization’s other products.

This issue is addressed here by offering the time‐resolved exact solutions with all Gaussian input pulses. The paper explains signal enhancement with a suppression of the background at the threshold delay time of the probe and presents a one‐to‐one comparison between the solutions and experimental observations that provides a reconstruction of the pure coherent Raman resonant contribution. These findings add to the deep understanding of coherent Raman spectroscopic experimental data as a hands‐on interpreting tool.

One of the research foci of MPEX regarded the upscaling effects of deep convective storms on their environment, and how these feed back to the convective-scale dynamics and predictability. Balloon-borne GPS radiosondes, or “upsondes,” were used to sample such environmental feedbacks. Two of the upsonde teams employed dual-frequency sounding systems that allowed for upsonde observations at intervals as fast as 15 min. Because these dual-frequency systems also had the capacity for full mobility during sonde reception, highly adaptive and rapid storm-relative sampling of the convectively modified environment was possible. This article documents the mobile sounding capabilities and unique sampling strategies employed during MPEX.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/bams/article-pdf/97/3/329/3744602/bams-d-14-00258_1.pdf",""

In addition, we examined the influence that having strong ties and a dense network of professional colleagues each has on the total number of citations garnered by those publications. Results showed a heterogeneous pattern of coauthoring (distributing coauthoring activity evenly across a greater number of coauthors) is positively related to the number of publications in the highest-quality journals for the focal researcher. The heterogeneity of research fields in which a researcher works is also positively related to greater productivity, albeit in second- and third-tier publication outlets.

While applicability of such films for high-temperature applications is not explored previously, herein we report the high-temperature electrical stability of silver (Ag) metal NP films fabricated using an Aerosol Jet based printing technique and demonstrate that this behavior is dictated by changes in the film microstructure. In-situ high temperature (24–500 °C) impedance spectroscopy measurements show that the real part of the impedance increases with increasing temperature up to 150 °C, at which point a decreasing trend prevails until 300 °C, followed again by an increase in impedance. The electrical behavior is correlated with the in-situ grain growth of the Ag NP films, as observed afterwards by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD), and could be tailored by controlling the initial microstructure through sintering conditions. Using combined diffraction and spectroscopic analytical methods, it is demonstrated the Aerosol Jet printed Ag NP films exhibit enhanced thermal stability and oxidation resistance. In addition to establishing the conditions for stability of Ag NP films, the results provide a fundamental understanding of the effect of grain growth and reduction in grain boundary area on the electrical stability of sintered NP films.","http://aip.scitation.org/doi/am-pdf/10.1063/1.4960779",""

We also investigate the moderating role of organizational support climate in the relationship between empowering leader behavior and these two forms of citizenship. Using data collected from 98 work teams in one large organization in China, in addition to support for the mediating role of psychological empowerment, we found a “double-edged” moderating effect for organizational support climate. For affiliative organizational citizenship behavior, and consistent with reciprocation perspectives posited by social exchange theory, results showed that the highest levels occurred when both empowering leadership behavior and organizational support climate were high. In contrast, for taking charge, and consistent with control theory, results showed that the highest levels occurred when empowering leadership behavior was high but when organizational support climate was low. Our findings highlight the counterintuitive notion that organizational support climate may not always have uniformly positive effects and also reinforce the importance of including both individual and work context factors when attempting to understand cross-level empowering leadership effects.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0149206314546193",""

We show that Aurora-A mediated H3 T118ph occurs at pericentromeres and chromosome arms during prophase and is lost upon chromosome alignment. Expression of H3 T118E or H3 T118I (a SIN mutation that bypasses the need for the ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeler SWI/SNF) leads to mitotic problems including defects in spindle attachment, delayed cytokinesis, reduced chromatin packaging, cohesion loss, cohesin and condensin I loss in human cells. In agreement, overexpression of Aurora-A leads to increased H3 T118ph levels, causing cohesion loss, and reduced levels of cohesin and condensin I on chromatin. Normal levels of H3 T118ph are important because it is required for development in fruit flies. We propose that H3 T118ph alters the chromatin structure during specific phases of mitosis to promote timely condensin I and cohesin disassociation, which is essential for effective chromosome segregation.","https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/11402/elife-11402-v2.pdf",""

Background: Nurses exhibit among the highest nonfatal injury rates of all occupations, which may be a consequence of long, cumulative work shift schedules. Fatigue may accumulate across multiple shifts and lead to performance impairments, which in turn may be linked to injury risks. Method: Thirty-seven nurses and aides performed isometric strength-based performance testing of three muscle groups, including the knee extensors, knee flexors, and wrist flexors (hand grip), as well as countermovement jumps, at baseline and following exposure to three 12-hour work shifts in a four-day period. Variables included peak torque (PT) and rate of torque development (RTD) from isometric strength testing and jump height and power output. Results: The rigorous work period resulted in significant decreases (−7.2% to −19.2%) in a large majority (8/9) of the isometric strength-based measurements. No differences were noted for the day versus night shift workers except for the RTD at 200 millisecond variable, for which the night shift had greater work-induced decreases than the day shift workers. No changes were observed for jump height or power output. Conclusions: A compressed nursing work schedule resulted in decreases in strength-based performance abilities, being indicative of performance fatigue. Application: Compressed work schedules involving long shifts lead to functional declines in nurse performance capacities that may pose risks for both the nurse and patient quality of care. Fatigue management plans are needed to monitor and regulate increased levels of fatigue.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0018720816677814",""

We find a robust positive relationship between product diversification and performance. Moreover, the positive relationship still holds when the performance measures are adjusted for volatility. These findings support the theoretical foundation of economies of scope and risk-reduction, as adapted to the U.S. health insurance industry. We also develop two empirical proxies for the underwriting and asset investment risk taking of health insurers. For health insurers, the relationship between performance and risk-taking in product and asset management is similar to other types of insurers. A noteworthy finding is that the positive relationship between product diversification and performance is stronger during the financial crisis years than in the recent healthcare reform era. This suggests that diversification as a risk reduction strategy may be less effective when reform changes the healthcare environment.","",""

The heat generated during the process may cause thermal damages to the surrounding tissues which can lead to detrimental postoperative problems. Having better understanding about the thermal spread helps to minimize these undesired thermal damages. The purpose of this study is to investigate the changes of tissue thermal conductivity during the joining process. We propose a hybrid method combining experimental measurement with inverse heat transfer analysis to determine thermal conductivity of thin tissue sample. Instead of self-heating the tissue by the thermistor, we apply an external cold boundary on the other side of the tissue sample to stimulate a higher temperature gradient without denaturing the tissue in comparison to the heated method. The inverse heat transfer technique was then applied to determine the tissue thermal conductivity. Tissue thermal conductivity at different levels (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) of the joining process was measured. The results show a decreasing trend in tissue thermal conductivity with increasing joining level. When the tissue is fully joined, an average of 60% reduction in tissue thermal conductivity was found.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2016-66932/2495931/v003t04a076-imece2016-66932.pdf",""

However, a sensory lexicon for determining descriptive differences resulting from breeding, agronomic, processing, storage, and brewing modifications is needed. This study developed a sensory lexicon for brewed coffee. More than 100 different coffee samples from 14 countries around the world were used to create this lexicon in four Phases. A highly trained panel assessed all coffee samples using descriptive analysis. The sensory panel identified 110 attributes (many used both for aroma and flavor) and references. Principal component analysis was used to map the scores obtained during the validation phase. For this phase the coffee lexicon allowed the panelists to describe specific characteristics that were present in the coffee samples such as sweet, nutty and fruity notes, as well as the differentiation of notes such as burnt, smoky, astringent, acrid and bitter. The developed attributes and references were successfully used by the trained panel to describe a wide range of coffee samples. The lexicon is considered “living” because additional terms should be added as needed to expand the lexicon to include attributes that are not included here. Practical applications: The terminology developed during this study is clear, easy to reproduce in future research, and accompanied by reference standards that provide a guide for future studies. This lexicon will provide an important tool for the coffee industry to conduct sensory evaluation to improve the understanding of coffee quality. It is a “living” lexicon that can be added to when samples exhibit notes that were not present in the samples used for this lexicon development.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fjoss.12237",""

We use a second-order semiparametric efficient score combined with a non-parametric imputation device for estimation. Compared with an imputed weighted least squares method, the approach proposed improves the efficiency of the parameter estimation whenever the third moment of the error distribution is non-zero. We compare the method with a parametric survival regression method in the A5175 study data analysis. In the data analysis, the method proposed shows a better fit to the data with smaller mean-squared residuals. In summary, this work provides a semiparametric framework in modelling and estimation of survival data.

Hence, in 2 experimental priming studies conducted within weeks of the first confirmed case of Ebola in the U.S., we examined whether extrinsically religious persons were especially likely to experience Ebola reminders as an existential threat that intensified national-security concerns (e.g., supporting strict travel bans, border security, and immigration laws). In Experiment 1 (N = 368), extrinsic religiousness was more strongly associated with national-security concerns in the Ebola prime, relative to a control group. In Experiment 2 (N = 532), we added a mortality salience condition. Replicating Experiment 1, extrinsic religiousness was more strongly associated with national-security concerns in both the Ebola prime and mortality salience conditions, relative to a control group. Taken together, large-scale existential threats may be especially likely to intensify proingroup/anti-outgroup biases among extrinsically religious individuals.

This study proposes a new choice model based on WTP, incorporating sequential decision making, where the products with positive utility of purchase are considered in the order of customer preference. We compare WTP‐choice model with the commonly used (multinomial) Logit model with respect to the underlying choice process, information requirement, and independence of irrelevant alternatives. Using WTP‐choice model, we find and compare equilibrium and centrally optimal prices and profits without considering inventory availability. In addition, we compare equilibrium prices and profits in two contexts: without considering inventory availability and under lost sales. One of the interesting results with WTP‐choice model is the “loose coupling” of retailers in competition; prices are not coupled but profits are. That is, each retailer should charge the monopoly price as the collection of these prices constitute an equilibrium but each retailer's profit depends on other retailers' prices. Loose coupling fails with dependence of WTPs or dependence of preference on prices. Also, we show that competition among retailers facing dependent WTPs can cause price cycles under some conditions. We consider real‐life data on sales of yogurt, ketchup, candy melt, and tuna, and check if a version of WTP‐choice model (with uniform, triangle, or shifted exponential WTP distribution), standard or mixed Logit model fits better and predicts the sales better. These empirical tests establish that WTP‐choice model compares well and should be considered as a legitimate alternative to Logit models for studying pricing for products with low price and high frequency of purchase.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fpoms.12582",""

Questions remain about the relationship between health behavior and FB usage and best strategies for evaluating health-related FB interventions. Furthermore, few studies examine health-related FB usage of people not designated as patients, which might help identify native activities that can sustain participants’ interest in and engagement with FB interventions. This study examines offline and online health-related activities of FB to identify characteristics shared by people who use FB for health-related purposes. The data from 455 users indicate that offline social health activities do not transfer online; privacy issues, interaction preferences, and differences between FB and offline networks may be barriers. FB campaigns and interventions should have modest and focused goals, such as supplementing offline activities and increasing preexisting FB activity.

Little is known about the molecular events that lead approximately 2-6% of cSCCs to metastasize. Treatment efforts are hampered by a lack of ability to predict which lesions are more likely to recur or metastasize as these known correlates do not have high specificity for prediction. Furthermore, there is no FDA approved therapy that is specifically indicated for metastatic cSCC. Deep-sequencing efforts have identified targetable mutations and pathways for several cancers. Exome and targeted sequencing of primary cSCCs led to the discovery that inactivating mutations in NOTCH pathway genes occur in over 75% of tumors; however NOTCH mutations are not indicative of metastasis. Published studies identified frequent mutations in KMT2C and KMT2D in cSCCs with aggressive features. To identify mutations that are unique to or enriched in metastatic samples which may help to identify novel therapeutics for treating aggressive cSCCs, we performed exome sequencing of 37 samples consisting of matched normal DNAs, primary tumors and metastatic cSCCs. Many of the mutations found in the metastatic samples were also observed in the matched primary tumors. We found an enrichment of mutations in chromatin remodeling genes. Epigenetic regulatory genes mutated in the metastatic samples included KMT2D (64%), KMT2C (44%), SETD2 (45%), KAT6A (36%), EP300 (18%), and KDM6A/UTX (9%).

The recent Every Student Succeeds Act reauthorization expresses a renewed focus on evidence of equity, effectiveness, and opportunity to learn. We propose that high school course taking patterns provide evidence of program effectiveness and equity in access. Research Design: Using data from the nationally representative Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002, we employ multinomial regression models to predict students’ likelihood of completing two types of high school coursework (basic graduation, college preparatory) by their linguistic status. Findings: Despite considerable linguistic, sociodemographic, and academic controls, marked disparities in high school course taking patterns remain, with EL students experiencing significantly less academic exposure. Implications for Policy and Practice: Building on McKenzie and Scheurich’s notion of an equity trap and evidence of a long-standing EL opportunity gap, we suggest that school leaders might use our findings and their own course taking patterns to prompt discussions about the causes and consequences of local EL placement processes. Such discussions have the potential to raise awareness about how educators and school leaders approach educational equity and access, key elements central to the spirit of EL education policy.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0013161X16648190",""

We find strong evidence that minority clients’ outcomes are positively associated with representation in portions of the bureaucracy with which they do not directly interact. This suggests that either passive representation produces substantial bottom-up, organizational-level effects or that managers who recruit minority personnel also adopt policies that are favorable toward minority clients.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0275074016660614",""

This method is inspired by the newly developed variational mode decomposition (VMD). The principle of VMD is to look for an ensemble of modes with their respective center frequencies, such that the modes collectively reproduce the input signal and each mode is smooth after demodulation into baseband. The advantage of VMD is that there is no residual noise in the modes and it can further decrease redundant modes compared with the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) and improved CEEMD (ICEEMD). Moreover, VMD is an adaptive signal decomposition technique, which can nonrecursively decompose a multicomponent signal into several quasi-orthogonal intrinsic mode functions. This new tool, in contrast to empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and its variations, such as EEMD, CEEMD, and ICEEMD, is based on a solid mathematical foundation and can obtain a time-frequency representation that is less sensitive to noise. Two tests on synthetic data showed the effectiveness of our VMD-based time-frequency analysis method.

We add to the understanding of legal claiming by evaluating how perceived levels of accountability, reputation and political skill affect individuals’ willingness to engage in contentious and non-contentious legal claiming. We also investigate the impact that social influence has on individuals’ advice to other potential claimants. This study employed a longitudinal design utilizing both scenarios and survey data collection. Results from our study partially support the conclusion that individuals are more risk-averse in their own legal claiming considerations than they are in the advice they offer to similarly-situated others. Furthermore, accountability, reputation and interpersonal influence (one aspect of political skill) were found to significantly influence the likelihood of legal claiming. The pattern of results indicates that social influence variables play a role in determining whether legal claiming will be pursued and what type of claiming will be chosen.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0018726716642506",""

From a practical laboratory point of view, a confined porosity measurement strategy is specifically introduced to measure the as-is porosity of heavy oil sand sample. This overall strategy primarily consists of two parts. First of all, as-is porosity is estimated by using the assumed parameters (grain density, fluid density, and fluids saturation) and measured bulk density that is calculated from the Archimedes principle, which not only keeps the sample intact, but also is advantageous for minimizing mass loss and external covers. Furthermore, by extracting the pore fluids (heavy oil, water, and possibly gas) from the original sample, the assumed indispensable parameters are precisely measured; more importantly, a group of porosity data can be calculated by applying directly measured grain volume data and bulk volume data. Based on the measured data and error analysis, we have concluded that the porosity calculated from these directly measured data set gives us a low porosity bound whereas as-is porosity estimated from the Archimedes principle indicates the upper bound.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/geo2015-0178.1",""

We analyzed data from the Texas Birth Defects Registry for 10,924 nonsyndromic cases and statewide vital records for deliveries during 1999–2009, using Poisson regression. After adjustment for potential confounders, hypospadias was associated with maternal hypertension (adjusted prevalence ratio: 1.5, 95% confidence interval: 1.4–1.7). Similar associations were observed with gestational and pregestational hypertension, including separate analyses restricted to the subset of cases with severe (second‐ or third‐degree) hypospadias. All of these associations were also similar among the subset of cases with isolated hypospadias (without additional birth defects). To evaluate the potential for bias due to potential hypertension misclassification, we repeated our analyses using logistic regression, comparing the cases to controls with other birth defects. In these analyses, the associations with gestational hypertension were similar, but adjusted associations with pregestational hypertension were no longer observed. Our findings support an association between gestational hypertension and hypospadias in offspring, but also suggest that previously observed associations with pregestational hypertension may have been inflated due to differential misclassification of hypertension (e.g., reporting bias). As gestational hypertension is recognized after hypospadias development, more research is needed to determine if this association reflects an increase in gestational hypertension risk secondary to hypospadias or if both conditions have shared risk factors (e.g., precursors of gestational hypertension). © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fajmg.a.37947",""

Organic shales exhibit significant variabilities in rock texture and reservoir properties at different maturity stages, subsequently affecting their elastic responses. We have developed a new rock-physics modeling scheme honoring the maturity levels (immature, mature, and overmature), which are constrained by the evolution of the physical properties of organic shale upon kerogen maturation. In particular, at different maturity stages, the manners in which the compliant organic materials interact with the inorganic mineral matrix are characterized by different effective medium theories. On the basis of the developed rock-physics templates, organic shales have different elastic behaviors at different maturity stages. Ignoring the impact of kerogen maturation is insufficient to adequately characterize the elasticity of the whole organic shale system. Modeling results suggest that the elastic responses of organic shale are sensitive to two dominant factors — organic matter content and mineralogical composition. The elastic anisotropy characteristics are not only affected by the kerogen content and clay alignment but also depend on the morphology of kerogen distribution. Our results compare satisfactorily with data from ultrasonic velocity and log measurements, confirming validity and applicability of our modeling framework.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/geo2015-0713.1",""

We contend that the splintering of combatant groups, a primary manifestation of rebel group fragmentation, produces potential spoiler groups that are neither incidental nor unimportant in the process of civil war resolution. Making connections to the spoiling and credible commitment literatures, we hypothesize that rebel splintering hastens the recurrence of civil wars. Using event history modeling and propensity score matching to analyze two different civil war datasets, we examine whether the occurrence of fragmentation during a civil war influences the length of peace after the civil war. The empirical analysis of fragmentation events during civil wars since World War II offers support for the hypothesis that splintering decreases the duration of post-civil war peace. The results suggest the need to pay closer attention to the dynamics of fragmentation, and particularly how these dynamics lead to future consequences – even when those consequences take place after the war has concluded. For example, governments that attempt to splinter groups or to use existing fragmentations within rebel groups to end a civil war may encourage the unintended consequence of shorter peace duration.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0022343315617067",""

The main idea involves approximation of the norm with a continuous or smooth unit dent function. The proposed method bridges the best subset selection and regularization by borrowing strength from both. It mimics the best subset selection using a penalized likelihood approach yet with no need of a tuning parameter. We further reformulate the problem with a reparameterization step so that it reduces to one unconstrained nonconvex yet smooth programming problem, which can be solved efficiently as in computing the maximum partial likelihood estimator (MPLE). Furthermore, the reparameterization tactic yields an additional advantage in terms of circumventing postselection inference. The oracle property of the proposed method is established. Both simulated experiments and empirical examples are provided for assessment and illustration.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fbiom.12484",""

The interval of time that lapses between first diagnosis and treatment is another disparity that may exist but has not been fully explored. Methods: Our study looked at the data of 749 men (353 black and 396 white) who were 40 to 81 years of age when they entered the North Carolina Central Cancer Registry during the years 2007 and 2008. Our dependent variable was the amount of months that had passed between first diagnosis and treatment. Our main independent variable was self-reported race. Covariates included age, income, level of education, insurance status, treatment received, Gleason score, and level of medical mistrust. We used negative binomial regression analysis to determine the association between the amount of time that lapsed between a diagnosis of prostate cancer and treatment by race. Results: Compared with white men, black men were more likely to experience a longer wait time between diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04–1.36). Controls for demographical, clinical, and psychosocial variables (IRR 1.24; 95% CI, 1.04–1.43) did not explain this difference between the races.

Despite the leading narrative of both parties overwhelmingly embracing OVR, we find that lawmaker support is clearly rooted in political calculations. Most prominent is a partisan divide, with Republicans in polarized legislatures with a Democratic majority decidedly less supportive of OVR. In addition, a host of contextual factors tied to the variation in partisan and electoral power affect the probability a state legislator votes in favor of this reform. We argue that the near-consensus position of Democrats (more than 90% voted “yea” on OVR) and the impressive supermajority of Republicans backing OVR (greater than 70%) have diverted attention from the reasons why there is opposition to this seemingly noncontroversial reform.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1532673X16661818",""

Researchers have stressed the value in finding easy, accurate and inexpensive methods for assessing potential stress within ecosystems. Here we use fluctuating asymmetry (FA) as a useful quantitative tool in assessing the environmental quality and potential urban-based stressors within eight creeks of the Bull and Upatoi Creeks Watershed within the larger watershed of the Middle Chattahoochee. Using Geographic Information System (GIS), we characterize land-use patterns and a decreasing urbanization gradient as related to each creek’s eastward position from Columbus, Georgia. We collected two common fishes (redbreast sunfish; Lepomis auritus and bluegill; Lepomis macrochirus), measured both metric and meristic traits and investigated if the degree of FA in these two common fishes correlated with the urbanization gradient across creeks. We found significant differences in FA among creeks with one of the highest FA measures for the most urban creek. Principal component analysis (PCA) scores of urbanization and water chemistry were regressed against FA scores. We found no significant relationship between urbanization and FA nor environmental water chemistry and FA among creeks.

In doing so, we model the system rates using gamma distributions that create randomness in operating characteristics used in the optimization formulation. We divide the day into discrete time intervals where a simulation based stochastic programming method is used to determine staffing levels. More specifically, we develop a model to select the optimal number of agents required for a given time interval by minimizing an expected cost function, which consists of agent and abandonment (opportunity) costs, while considering the service quality requirements such as the delay probability. The objective function as well as the constraints in our formulation are random variables. The novelty of our approach is to introduce a solution method for the staffing of an operation where all three system rates (arrival, service, and abandonment) are random variables. We illustrate the use of the proposed model using both real and simulated call center data. In addition, we provide solution comparisons across different formulations, consider a dynamic extension, and discuss sensitivity implications of changing constraint upper bounds as well as prior hyper‐parameters. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

They must also continue to behave securely. Positive outcomes of secure behavior may encourage the continuance of that behavior, whereas negative outcomes may lead users to adopt less-secure behaviors. For example, in the context of authentication, login success rates may determine whether users continue to use a strong credential or switch to less secure behaviors (e.g., storing a credential or changing to a weaker, albeit easier to successfully enter, credential). Authentication is a particularly interesting security behavior for information systems researchers to study because it is affected by an IT artifact (the design of the user interface). Laptops and desktop computers use full-size physical keyboards. However, users are increasingly adopting mobile devices, which provide either miniature physical keypads or touchscreens for entering authentication credentials. The difference in interface design affects the ease of correctly entering authentication credentials. Thus, the move to use of mobile devices to access systems provides an opportunity to study the effects of the user interface on authentication behaviors. We extend existing process models of secure behaviors to explain what influences their (dis)continuance. We conduct a longitudinal field experiment to test our predictions and find that the user interface does affect login success rates. In turn, poor performance (login failures) leads to discontinuance of a secure behavior and the adoption of less-secure behaviors. In summary, we find that a process model reveals important insights about how the IT artifact leads people to (dis)continue secure behaviors.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/isre.2016.0634",""

The current study explores accessibility barriers to the use of RDTs in Niger State and makes recommendations for improving the uptake of RDTs. The study employs literature review, review of data from the Niger State Health Management Information System for January–October 2013, and application of Peters’ conceptual framework for assessing access to health services. Data showed that 27 percent of public health facilities (HFs) implemented RDTs, with the aid of donor funds. In these facilities, 77 percent of fever cases presented during the study period were tested with RDTs; 53 percent of fever cases were confirmed cases of malaria, while 60 percent of fever cases were treated. Stockouts of RDTs were a major constraint, and severe fever tended to trigger presumptive treatment. We conclude that although implementation of RDTs led to a reduction in the use of ACTs at HFs, more substantial reduction could be achieved if the state government directed more resources towards the acquisition of RDTs as well as raising the level of awareness of potential users.","http://downloads.hindawi.com/archive/2016/7436265.pdf",""

The key players in avoiding apoptosis are collectively known as survival proteins. Survival proteins comprise the Bcl-2, inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP), and heat shock protein (HSP) families. The aberrant expression of these proteins is associated with a range of biological activities that promote cancer cell survival, proliferation, and resistance to therapy. Several therapeutic strategies that target survival proteins are based on mimicking BH3 domains or the IAP-binding motif or competing with ATP for the Hsp90 ATP-binding pocket. Alternative strategies, including use of nutraceuticals, transcriptional repression, and antisense oligonucleotides, provide options to target survival proteins. This review focuses on the role of survival proteins in chemoresistance and current therapeutic strategies in preclinical or clinical trials that target survival protein signaling pathways. Recent approaches to target survival proteins-including nutraceuticals, small-molecule inhibitors, peptides, and Bcl-2-specific mimetic are explored. Therapeutic inventions targeting survival proteins are promising strategies to inhibit cancer cell survival and chemoresistance. However, complete eradication of resistance is a distant dream. For a successful clinical outcome, pretreatment with novel survival protein inhibitors alone or in combination with conventional therapies holds great promise.","https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8247/9/1/11/pdf",""

Apart from the unexplained changes by GCMs, the process of customizing GCM projections to watershed scale through a model chain—spatial downscaling, temporal disaggregation, and hydrologic model—also introduces errors, thereby limiting the ability to explain the observed changes in hydrologic variability. Toward this, we first propose metrics for quantifying the errors arising from different steps in the model chain in explaining the observed changes in hydrologic variables (streamflow and groundwater). The proposed metrics are then evaluated using a detailed retrospective analyses in projecting the changes in streamflow and groundwater attributes in four target basins that span across a diverse hydroclimatic regimes over the U.S. Sunbelt. Our analyses focused on quantifying the dominant sources of errors in projecting the changes in eight hydrologic variables—mean and variability of seasonal streamflow, mean and variability of 3 day peak seasonal streamflow, mean and variability of 7 day low seasonal streamflow, and mean and standard deviation of groundwater depth—over four target basins using an Penn state Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM) between the period 1956–1980 and 1981–2005. Retrospective analyses show that small/humid (large/arid) basins show increased (reduced) uncertainty in projecting the changes in hydrologic attributes. Further, changes in error due to GCMs primarily account for the unexplained changes in mean and variability of seasonal streamflow. On the other hand, the changes in error due to temporal disaggregation and hydrologic model account for the inability to explain the observed changes in mean and variability of seasonal extremes. Thus, the proposed metrics provide insights on how the error in explaining the observed changes being propagated through the model under different hydroclimatic regimes.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/2016JD025138",""

At the same time, anecdotal evidence and observation have pointed to a lack of courses offered in languages other than English as one potential challenge for global use of MOOCs. We present a first empirical attempt to characterize the linguistic diversity of MOOCs and understand the resulting implications for the use of MOOCs in international development. We find significant differences in quantities and types of MOOCs available in English and non‐English languages. This finding indicates that MOOCs do not yet provide a broad array of educational opportunities for people without adequate English‐language proficiency and therefore, MOOCs may have limited potential for use in international development outside English‐speaking populations at present. In recognition of efforts to increase linguistic diversity of MOOC offerings, we review and describe two types of initiatives, those to translate existing MOOCs and those to create new MOOCs in non‐English languages, initiatives we identify as scaling‐up or scaling‐down MOOCs respectively. To situate our findings in development discourse, we turn to Sen's capability approach () to consider implications for the use of MOOCs in socioeconomic development.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fpra2.2016.14505301071",""

In the present work, we assessed the contribution of both factors. We evaluated whether a measure of processing fluency (i.e., self-paced study) mediated the relationship between pair type and JOLs (Experiment 1) and attempted to disrupt processing fluency using an AlTeRnAtInG presentation format (Experiment 2). We also evaluated whether judgments made in the absence of processing fluency demonstrated the identical effect (Experiment 3), and, finally, we had participants read a vignette about an experiment that included both pair types and estimate which pairs would be best remembered (Experiment 4). Evidence from all experiments converged on the conclusion that people's beliefs about how variables affect memory—and not differential fluency—best explain the identical effect, although we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that fluency plays a small role. The outcomes were consistent with the analytic-processing theory of JOLs—namely, when instructed to make JOLs, people adopt an analytic problem-solving approach that involves identifying variation across pairs that plausibly relate to memory and then use this variation to make JOLs.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17470218.2015.1058404",""

When it is feasible, DTs are surgically resected; however, this often results in high recurrence rates. Recently, treatment with PF-03084014, a potent γ-secretase inhibitor, has been shown to have antitumor activity in several tumor types by affecting the WNT/β-catenin pathway. Consequently, Notch pathway inhibition by PF-03084014 might be a promising approach for DT treatment. The expression of Notch pathway components was analyzed in DT tissues and cell strains with immunohistochemistry and Western blotting, respectively. A panel of DT cell strains was exposed to PF-03084014 and evaluated for cell proliferation. Antitumor effects were assessed via cell cycle, apoptosis, and migration and invasion analysis. Cells treated with PF-03084014 were characterized with a gene array analysis combined with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. The results showed that Notch pathway components were expressed at different levels in DTs. Hes1 (Hes Family BHLH Transcription Factor 1) was overexpressed in DT tumors versus dermal scar tissue, and PF-03084014 caused significant decreases in Notch intracellular domain and Hes1 expression in DT cell strains. PF-03084014 decreased DT cell migration and invasion and also caused cell growth inhibition in DT cell strains, most likely through cell cycle arrest. Gene array analysis combined with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis showed that Wnt1-inducible signaling pathway protein 2 possibly regulated Notch and WNT pathways after treatment with PF-03084014 through integrin. Our findings suggest that the Notch pathway is an important DT therapeutic target. Furthermore, PF-03084014 has significant antitumor activity against DTs, and it may be an alternative strategy for DT treatment.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/76/14_Supplement/2286/609425/Abstract-2286-Targeting-the-notch-pathway-A",""

A vertical region of interest for the analysis of interaction LLJ–wind turbine has been delimited, and the LLJ length scales have been calculated. The analysis of power spectra exhibited a deviation within the inertial subrange from the classical −5/3 slope in a log-log representation towards a lower slope, which indicated a lower rate of energy transfer when the LLJ was present. It has been observed that during a LLJ event the turbulence intensity and turbulence kinetic energy were significantly lower than those during unstable conditions; and cyclical aerodynamic loads on the turbine blades produced a negative impact on the wind turbine, mainly due to the enhanced wind shear. Dominant frequencies present in the power spectra of the incoming wind were also observed in frequencies related to the dynamic loads of the turbines. It was found that the wind turbine can mimic the signals from the approaching inlet flow, although some of the replication can be altered or annulled in a wind farm.","http://aip.scitation.org/doi/am-pdf/10.1063/1.4945359",""

Exploitative competition is an indirect effect that occurs through use of a shared resource and depends on resource availability. Interference competition occurs by obstructing access to a resource and may not depend on resource availability. Our study tested whether the strength of interference competition changes with protozoa population density. We grew experimental microcosms of protozoa and bacteria under different combinations of protozoan density and basal resource availability. We then solved a dynamic predator–prey model for parameters of the functional response using population growth rates measured in our experiment. As population density increased, competition shifted from exploitation to interference, and competition was less dependent on resource levels. Surprisingly, the effect of resources was weakest when competition was the most intense. We found that at low population densities, competition was largely exploitative and resource availability had a large effect on population growth rates, but the effect of resources was much weaker at high densities. This shift in competitive mechanism could have implications for interspecific competition, trophic interactions, community diversity, and natural selection. We also tested whether this shift in the mechanism of competition with protozoa density affected the structure of the bacterial prey community. We found that both resources and protozoa density affected the structure of the bacterial prey community, suggesting that competitive mechanism may also affect trophic interactions.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ece3.2284",""

This article presents a theory of budgetary allocation based on the interaction between politics and professionalism, two seemingly disparate perspectives. Furthermore, we separate professionalism into two dimensions—demand and need. Through an analysis of budgeting decisions for bilingual education, we find that political representation leads to more positive budgetary changes for low-demand and, conversely, high-need environments.

These events are from a surface microseismic data set gathered during hydraulic-fracture stimulation of the Marcellus gas shale in Washington County, Pennsylvania, USA. The majority of these 59 events have a horizontal nodal plane ([Formula: see text] a few degrees) characteristic of a dip-slip/horizontal-slip moment tensor. If the horizontal nodal plane is an auxiliary, the vertical nodal plane has a pure dip-slip motion, which is inconsistent with the opening motion for vertical hydraulic fractures that enables proppant loading. This points to slip on horizontal nodal planes with the auxiliary vertical nodal planes aligned with the local maximum horizontal stress orientation as indicated by drilling-induced fractures in nearby vertical wells. These 59 microseismic events are caused by slip on horizontal mechanical discontinuities such as bedding planes during the opening of vertical hydraulic fractures, a model first proposed by research teams headed by Rutledge and Eisner, respectively. During several stimulation stages in the Washington County Marcellus gas shale, a pattern of opposite slip direction develops within “double lineaments” of microseismic clouds. This suggests that fracking fluid is not only able to move in the direction of fracture propagation, but it can also spread sideways into previously unstimulated rock. A secondary microseismic cloud consistently initiates at approximately 133 m (400 ft) from the position opposite the central perforation toward the unstimulated heel of the horizontal wells. From these moment tensors, we have concluded that microseismic focal mechanisms with horizontal nodal planes are direct evidence of the presence of treatment fluid in open hydraulic fractures.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/geo2015-0370.1",""

However, enrollment rates in such programs are low, and trends of forestland parcelization hint at an even smaller enrollment rate in the future. Therefore, it is important to understand how socioeconomic attributes of forestland owners and past experience with such programs affect the likelihood of enrollment in public incentive programs. Among others, this will help us provide tailored information to forestland owners who are less likely to use these opportunities through extension and outreach programs. Towards this end, we conducted a survey of 1800 forestland owners in Virginia and Texas. Our recursive partitioning, logistic regression, and Cochran–Armitage trend test results suggest that forestland owners who are less likely to enroll in such programs have relatively smaller forestland acreage, a lower level of education, and shorter land ownership tenure. We also find that forestland owners with experience in public incentive programs tend to attach higher importance to potential programs, including those that do not directly benefit them.

While biclustering has applications in a wide array of domains, ranging from text mining to collaborative filtering, the problem of identifying structure in high-dimensional genomic data motivates this work. In this context, biclustering enables us to identify subsets of genes that are co-expressed only within a subset of experimental conditions. We present a convex formulation of the biclustering problem that possesses a unique global minimizer and an iterative algorithm, COBRA, that is guaranteed to identify it. Our approach generates an entire solution path of possible biclusters as a single tuning parameter is varied. We also show how to reduce the problem of selecting this tuning parameter to solving a trivial modification of the convex biclustering problem. The key contributions of our work are its simplicity, interpretability, and algorithmic guarantees—features that arguably are lacking in the current alternative algorithms. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach, which includes stably and reproducibly identifying biclusterings, on simulated and real microarray data.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fbiom.12540",""

Methods: A needs assessment on ID using a multi‐method approach in two randomly selected districts (mothers (N=161) with all their children less than 5 years (N‐175)) in Northern Ghana in April, 2012. The intervention was a 5‐day (90 minutes/day) nutrition education program consisting of ten key messages addressing gaps identified in the needs assessment. The messages were delivered through practical, pictorial and interactive sessions among 73 mothers in the randomly selected intervention district in July, 2013. After which each mother was later visited twice (2 weeks apart) in her households to refresh and integrate the messages to her household situation. Three months after the intervention, a questionnaire, designed by the researcher, was administered via in‐person interviews with mothers to assess recall of messages, adherence and barriers to implementation. Content analysis was used to categorize responses into themes as reported. Results: Of the mothers (N=71), most were married (98.6%), had no formal education (98.6%), were living in rural households with a median monthly income of 40 cedis ($13.3), mainly from farm produce. Conclusion: Messages for nutrition education, even when contextualized, still had barriers to recall and adherence. The mother's social environment, including other household members, discouraged her from relaying knowledge on pica practices and sanitation. Behavior change models with elements targeted at building the confidence of mothers to act as change agents within their households and community may be more successful.","",""

However, this signal subspace actually still contains residual noise. We have derived a new formula of low-rank reduction, which is more powerful in distinguishing between signal and noise compared with the traditional TSVD. By introducing a damping factor into traditional MSSA to dampen the singular values, we have developed a new algorithm for random noise attenuation. We have named our modified MSSA as damped MSSA. The denoising performance is controlled by the damping factor, and our approach reverts to the traditional MSSA approach when the damping factor is sufficiently large. Application of the damped MSSA algorithm on synthetic and field seismic data demonstrates superior performance compared with the conventional MSSA algorithm.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/geo2015-0264.1",""

Utilizing 27 items derived from the 34-item version of the FES, which had represented differential levels of empowerment (family, service system, community) as indexed by one’s attitudes, knowledge, and behavior, we explored the factor structure, internal consistency, construct, and convergent validity of the FES with grandparent caregivers. Three-hundred forty-three ( M age = 58.45, SD = 8.22, n Caucasian = 152, n African American = 149, n Hispanic = 38) custodial grandmothers caring for grandchildren between ages 4 and 12 years completed the 27 FES items and various measures of their psychological well-being, grandchild psychological difficulties, emotional support, and parenting practices. Factor analysis revealed three factors that differed slightly from the originally proposed FES subscales: Parental Self-Efficacy/Self-Confidence, Service Activism, and Service Knowledge. Each of the factors was internally consistent, and derived factor scores were moderately interrelated, speaking to the question of convergent validity. The construct validity of these three factors was evidenced by meaningful patterns of statistically significant correlations with grandmothers’ psychological well-being, grandchild psychological difficulties, emotional support, and parenting practices. These factor scores were independent of grandmother age, health, and education.

We have engineered HEK293T cells to secrete EVs by overexpressing Lamp-2A protein containing liver cancer targeting peptide PC94 and therapeutic pre-miR-199. The novel feature of this system is that both the cargo and the microvesicles are synthesized by the same cells, thus abrogating the need for loading synthetic oligonucleotides into EVs. The pre-miR-199a loop region was modified such that it resembled the HIV-1 transactivation response (TAR) RNA which was engineered into the Lamp2A intron. Correct splicing of the intron portion and processing of the mature miRNA was evaluated after its transfection into HEK293T cells. Computational modeling was used to study the interaction between the modified pre-miR-199a loop (TAR RNA) and the TAT peptide. This study exhibited a stable interaction between the two and also showed that the peptide is not bound to the stem portion of the RNA loop, permitting the insertion of any pre-miRNA sequence. EMSA gel shift, rDICER processing and luciferase assays were performed to study the correct binding, processing and functionality of the modified sequence. These results show that the modified loop is actively involved in binding with the TAT peptide and it enables the modified miRNA to be loaded in the microvesicles. In an effort to assess the loading of the therapeutic miR-199a-3p relative to other endogenous miRNAs contained within the EVs, we performed small RNA sequencing on RNA isolated from both the producing cells and purified EVs. Triplicate samples of RNA isolated from 3 different HEK293T producing cells were sequenced: wild type HEK293T and those stably transfected with the empty vector (empty) or the TAT/TAR pre-miR-199a (full). The expression of the miRNAs were ranked from the RNA sequenced in both the cells and EVs. Producing cells engineered to express miR-199a-3p containing the TAT/TAR loading motif ranked third when comparing the ratio of miRNAs loaded in the EVs from the full to empty cells. Interestingly, certain mature miRNAs were preferentially loaded into the EVs, including miR-451a, miR-122 and miR-1246. As reported by Villarroya-Beltri, et al., (Nature Comm., 2013) in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, all three mature miRNAs contained 4 nucleotide “exo motifs” in their 3’ end that likely caused preferential loading into HEK293T EVs. Our data demonstrate that stably transfecting HEK293T cells with vectors expressing therapeutic miRNAs dramatically increases their loading into EVs.

The adoption of an evolutionary ecology framework aimed to diminish the impact of tick‐borne diseases needs to be part of strategies to protect human and animal populations. We present a review of current knowledge on the adaptation of ticks to their environment, and the impact that global change could have on their geographic distribution in North America. Environmental pressures will affect tick population genetics by selecting genotypes able to withstand new and changing environments and by altering the connectivity and isolation of several tick populations. Research in these areas is particularly lacking in the southern United States and most of Mexico with knowledge gaps on the ecology of these diseases, including a void in the identity of reservoir hosts for several tick‐borne pathogens. Additionally, the way in which anthropogenic changes to landscapes may influence tick‐borne disease ecology remains to be fully understood. Enhanced knowledge in these areas is needed in order to implement effective and sustainable integrated tick management strategies. We propose to refocus ecology studies with emphasis on metacommunity‐based approaches to enable a holistic perspective addressing whole pathogen and host assemblages. Network analyses could be used to develop mechanistic models involving multihost–pathogen communities. An increase in our understanding of the ecology of tick‐borne diseases across their geographic distribution will aid in the design of effective area‐wide tick control strategies aimed to diminish the burden of pathogens transmitted by ticks.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Farch.21327",""

Indeed, social work programs in the United States have been criticized for failing to prepare graduates for teaching; however, it has been a number of years since doctoral curricula have been reviewed. The purpose of this study was to examine the extent to which US social work doctoral programs are training their students to teach by assessing the extent to which pedagogical training is explicitly integrated into doctoral curricula and examining the scope and content of required doctoral courses on teaching. Content analysis of social work doctoral program curricula ( n = 72) and teaching and learning related course syllabi ( n = 24) was conducted by two coders. Syllabi were coded and analyzed to produce a profile of course objectives, readings, teaching strategies, assessment methods, and course content. Findings: Of the 72 PhD programs, 90% included a goal related to the preparation of their students for teaching; however, only 37 (51%) required a course on teaching. Course content, teaching, and assessment methods were found to vary across courses. Applications: Training the next generation of social work practitioners to engage in effective social work practice is critical to the profession; however, the preparation of doctoral students to provide quality education to future social work practitioners seems to be largely neglected.

The paper draws from an ongoing research project that is evaluating perceptions of environmental change, specifically of precipitation and flooding dynamics, in order to understand social responses.

Mutations and post‐translational modifications stabilize high‐energy inactive conformers, with mostly formed, but distorted, active sites. In order to examine the interconversion of active and inactive states in the ensemble, we used DRoP to analyze 4,995 waters in 15 high‐resolution (<2.0 Å) structures of wild‐type caspase‐3, resulting in 450 clusters with the most highly conserved set containing 145 water molecules. The data show that regions of the protein that contact the conserved waters also correspond to sites of post‐translational modifications, suggesting that the conserved waters are an integral part of allosteric mechanisms. To test this hypothesis, we created a library of nineteen caspase‐3 variants through saturation mutagenesis in a single position of the allosteric site of the dimer interface, and we show that the enzyme activity varies over four orders of magnitude. Altogether, our database consists of 37 high‐resolution structures of caspase‐3 variants, and we demonstrate that each 10‐fold decrease in activity correlates with a loss of 23 conserved water molecules. The data show that the activity of caspase‐3 can be fine‐tuned through globally de‐solvating the active conformer within the native ensemble, providing a mechanism for cells to repartition the ensemble and thus fine‐tune activity through conformational selection.","",""

Method: Using longitudinal data from the Pathways to Desistance Study, which follows a sample of 1354 serious juvenile offenders from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Phoenix, Arizona between mid‐adolescence and early adulthood, we estimate group‐based trajectory models of both emotional dating violence and physical dating violence over a span of five years in young adulthood. We then estimate multinomial logistic regression models to identify theoretically motivated risk factors that predict membership in these groups. Results: We identified three developmental patterns of emotional dating violence: none (33%), low‐level (59%) and high‐level decreasing (8%). The best‐fitting model for physical dating violence also had three groups: none (73%), low‐level (24%) and high‐level (3%). Race/ethnicity, family and psychosocial variables were among the strongest predictors of both emotional and physical dating violence. In addition, delinquency history variables predicted emotional dating violence and relationship variables predicted physical dating violence. Conclusions: Dating violence is quite prevalent in young adulthood among serious juvenile offenders. Numerous predictors distinguish between chronic dating violence perpetrators and other groups.

In viscoacoustic media, reverse time migration (RTM) can be performed with [Formula: see text]-compensation, which is also known as [Formula: see text]-RTM. Least-squares RTM (LSRTM) has also been shown to be able to compensate for attenuation through linearized inversion. However, seismic attenuation may significantly slow down the convergence rate of the least-squares iterative inversion process without proper preconditioning. We have found that incorporating attenuation compensation into LSRTM can improve the speed of convergence in attenuating media, obtaining high-quality images within the first few iterations. Based on the low-rank one-step seismic modeling operator in viscoacoustic media, we have derived its adjoint operator using nonstationary filtering theory. The proposed forward and adjoint operators can be efficiently applied to propagate viscoacoustic waves and to implement attenuation compensation. Recognizing that, in viscoacoustic media, the wave-equation Hessian may become ill-conditioned, we propose to precondition LSRTM with [Formula: see text]-compensated RTM. Numerical examples showed that the preconditioned [Formula: see text]-LSRTM method has a significantly faster convergence rate than LSRTM and thus is preferable for practical applications.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/geo2015-0520.1",""

Method: An online survey was developed to identify the academic, clinical, and specific fluency-related experiences professionals had when they were undergraduate and graduate students. The survey was completed by 219 professionals within the field of speech-language pathology (122 self-identified specialists, 97 self-identified non-specialists). Results: Considerable overlap was observed in training experiences of self-identified specialists and non-specialists. However, Chi-square analyses revealed a significantly greater proportion of self-identified specialists reported (a) completion of a dedicated course in fluency disorders during undergraduate and graduate curriculum, (b) interaction with five or more fluency clients during clinical practicum, and (c) exposure to specific fluency-related activities such as voluntary stuttering and attendance at a fluency-related support group. Conclusions: Findings suggest that despite the degree of overlap between self-identified specialists' and non-specialists' pre-professional training, the quantity and quality of certain experiences may influence future decisions to focus more exclusively on working with persons who stutter.","http://pubs.asha.org/doi/pdf/10.1044/persp1.SIG4.16",""

In this study, we examined whether and to what extent the characteristics of instructor-generated tests impact the exam performance of male and female and middle/high- and low-socioeconomic status (SES) students enrolled in introductory biology courses. We collected exam scores for 4810 students from 87 unique exams taken across 3 yr of the introductory biology series at a large research university. We determined the median Bloom’s level and the percentage of constructed-response questions for each exam. Despite controlling for prior academic ability in our models, we found that males and middle/high-SES students were disproportionately favored as the Bloom’s level of exams increased. Additionally, middle/high-SES students were favored as the proportion of constructed-response questions on exams increased.

Case Summary: A 53-year-old female with a past medical history of cancer (unknown source/type) and hypothyroidism was admitted to the hospital with cervical and paravertebral abscess with suspected sepsis. In the emergency department (ED), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed possible spinal abscess and narrowing of the spinal canal. The patient was initiated on vancomycin 1,250 mg (~15 mg/kg) every 12 hours and cefepime 2 g every 8 hours empirically. On hospital day 4, blood and wound cultures revealed MRSA susceptible to vancomycin, but with a vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2. Repeat blood cultures were also positive on hospital days 2 and 4. Per infectious disease team consult, therapy was converted to daptomycin 8 mg/kg/day. Although the patient responded well, acute kidney injury (AKI) on hospital day 15 prompted a change in therapy to ceftaroline fosamil 400 mg intravenous every 8 hours. For the remainder of the hospital stay, blood cultures were negative and white blood cell count was within normal limits. On day 20, the patient was discharged to a long-term care facility for continued ceftaroline treatment. Discussion: The management of MRSA bacteremia remains challenging due to increasing antimicrobial resistance. Although the standard therapy for serious MRSA infections is vancomycin, treatment failures are becoming common in clinical practice due to increasing MICs (≥2 μg/mL). Other therapies may include daptomycin and off-label treatment with telavancin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, or ceftaroline fosamil. This report describes a patient with paravertebral abscess and MRSA bacteremia failing 3 days of vancomycin therapy due to MIC greater than or equal to 2 μg/mL and persistent bacteremia. Treatment with ceftaroline fosamil was well tolerated and resulted in continued clinical improvement. Based on this case report, ceftaroline fosamil may be a reasonable alternative for invasive MRSA infections. Conclusions: This case report describes successful treatment of MRSA bacteremia with ceftaroline in a patient who responded poorly to conventional therapy, specifically vancomycin due to an elevated MIC (2 μg/mL).","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1310/hpj5101-68",""

We have developed two methods for blended data free-surface multiple attenuation. The first method is based on an extension of surface-related multiple elimination (SRME) theory, in which free-surface multiples of the blended data can be predicted by a multidimensional convolution of the seismic data with the inverse of the blending operator. A least-squares inversion method is used, which indicates that crosstalk noise existed in the prediction result due to the approximate inversion. An adaptive subtraction procedure similar to that used in conventional SRME is then applied to obtain the blended primary — this can damage the energy of primaries. The second method is based on inverse data processing (IDP) theory adapted to blended data. We derived a formula similar to that used in conventional IDP, and we attenuated free-surface multiples by simple muting of the focused points in the inverse data space (IDS). The location of the focused points in the IDS for blended data, which can be calculated, is also related to the blending operator. We chose a singular value decomposition-based inversion algorithm to stabilize the inversion in the IDP method. The advantage of IDP compared with SRME is that, it does not have crosstalk noise and is able to better preserve the primary energy. The outputs of our methods are all blended primaries, and they can be further processed using blended data-based algorithms. Synthetic data examples show that the SRME and IDP algorithms for blended data are successful in attenuating free-surface multiples.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/geo2015-0408.1",""

Knowledge gaps have resulted in under diagnosis or delayed diagnosis. METHODS: The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center pathology database (1991‐2014) was retrospectively interrogated for the keywords “hemophagocytosis” and/or “lymphohistiocytosis.” Seventy‐seven adult patients were identified. All had an underlying malignancy. Sixteen patients who had insufficient documentation were excluded. RESULTS: The majority of patients who had pathologic evidence of hemophagocytosis/lymphohistiocytosis had an incomplete workup to confirm or refute HLH using the 2004 HLH criteria (HLH‐2004; n = 8 variables), which is a common problem in adult HLH. Only 13 of 61 patients (21%) met the HLH‐2004 diagnostic criteria based on available retrospective data. To identify potentially missed cases of HLH, the published literature was reviewed, and selected additional variables known to be associated with adult HLH were selected, resulting in extended diagnostic criteria of 18 variables. Thirty‐five patients met the extended criteria, and 33 had follow‐up data available. The median overall survival of the 13 patients who met both the extended criteria and the HLH‐2004 criteria was similar to that of the 20 patients who met the extended criteria but NOT the HLH‐2004 criteria (1.43 vs 1.76 months, respectively; CONCLUSIONS: The addition of diagnostic laboratory variables that are more easily and rapidly available in smaller institutions and primary care settings than the HLH‐2004 variables may be a good surrogate to raise early suspicion of malignancy‐associated HLH.

Angiotensin II (Ang II) has long been known to stimulate thirst by both by its action peripherally as a circulating hormone, and centrally acting as a peptide neurotransmitter. Peripherally circulating Ang II can elicit thirst by stimulating the Subfornical Organ (SFO), which in turn stimulates other hypothalamic nuclei regulating body fluid homeostasis such as the Median Preoptic Nucleus (MnPO) presumably through Ang II signaling. Central Ang II administered via intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion also induces thirst by directly stimulating regions such as the MnPO. Previous studies have shown that lesions of the MnPO block drinking responses to peripheral or ICV Ang II while lesions of the SFO decrease drinking stimulated by peripheral Ang II but not ICV Ang II. Based on these observations, it has been hypothesized that Ang II receptors in the MnPO are critical for drinking responses to centrally or peripherally administered Ang II. We tested this hypothesis by microinjecting an adeno‐associated virus with short hairpin RNA matched to the Angiotensin Type 1a receptor (AT1aR) into the MnPO and testing the rats for drinking responses elicited by peripheral or centrally administered Ang II. Sprague Dawley rats were separated into subcutaneous (SC) and ICV Ang II administration groups. The SC group was pretested for their drinking response to 2 mg/kg Ang II, and those animals that drank in response to the SC Ang II administration were utilized in the study. All animals were injected with the shAt1aR virus or a control virus on Day 0, and were allowed to recover before drinking tests on day 14 and day 18. ICV animals were microinjected with the viruses on Day 0 and instrumented with a chronic lateral ventricle cannula. These animals were tested for drinking responses to 2 ng Ang II in 1ul aCSF 14 and 18 days later. Unexpectedly, we found that knockdown of AT1aR in the MnPO did not reduce drinking in response to SC Ang II (p>.05), but did significantly reduce drinking in response to ICV Ang II (P<.05). These results suggest that AT1aRs in MnPO are necessary for drinking responses following ICV Ang II but not SC Ang II. It is possible that drinking responses to peripheral Ang II involves co‐transmitters, such as glutamate, in the MnPO that produce drinking in the absence of AT1aRs or that other Ang II receptors mediate this response.","",""

Traditional phase II clinical trial designs were developed for evaluating one candidate treatment at a time and thus not efficient for this task. We propose a Bayesian phase II platform design, the multi‐candidate iterative design with adaptive selection (MIDAS), which allows investigators to continuously screen a large number of candidate agents in an efficient and seamless fashion. MIDAS consists of one control arm, which contains a standard therapy as the control, and several experimental arms, which contain the experimental agents. Patients are adaptively randomized to the control and experimental agents based on their estimated efficacy. During the trial, we adaptively drop inefficacious or overly toxic agents and ‘graduate’ the promising agents from the trial to the next stage of development. Whenever an experimental agent graduates or is dropped, the corresponding arm opens immediately for testing the next available new agent. Simulation studies show that MIDAS substantially outperforms the conventional approach. The proposed design yields a significantly higher probability for identifying the promising agents and dropping the futile agents. In addition, MIDAS requires only one master protocol, which streamlines trial conduct and substantially decreases the overhead burden.

Most such applications achieve interoperability via the eXtensible Markup Language (XML), the de facto document standard for information exchange in domains such as library repositories, collaborative software development, health informatics, etc. The use of a common data format facilitates exchange and interoperability across heterogeneous systems, but challenges in the aspect of security arise (e.g. sharing policies, ownership, permissions, etc.). In such situations, one key security challenge is to integrate the local security (existing systems) into a global solution for the application being constructed and deployed. In this chapter, the authors present a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) security framework for XML, which utilizes extensions to the Unified Modeling Language (UML) to generate eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) policies that target XML schemas and instances for any application, and provides both the separation and reconciliation of local and global security policies across systems. To demonstrate the framework, they provide a case study in health care, using the XML standards Health Level Seven's (HL7) Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) and the Continuity of Care Record (CCR). These standards are utilized for the transportation of private and identifiable information between stakeholders (e.g. a hospital with an electronic health record, a clinic's electronic health record, a pharmacy system, etc.), requiring not only a high level of security but also compliance to legal entities. For this reason, it is not only necessary to secure private information, but for its application to be flexible enough so that updating security policies that affect millions of documents does not incur a large monetary or computational cost; such privacy could similarly involve large banks and credit card companies that have similar information to protect to deter identity theft. The authors demonstrate the security framework with two in-house developed applications: a mobile medication management application and a medication reconciliation application. They also detail future trends that present even more challenges in providing security at global and local levels for platforms such as Microsoft HealthVault, Harvard SMART, Open mHealth, and open electronic health record systems. These platforms utilize XML, equivalent information exchange document standards (e.g., JSON), or semantically augmented structures (e.g., RDF and OWL). Even though the primary use of these platforms is in healthcare, they present a clear picture of how diverse the information exchange process can be. As a result, they represent challenges that are domain independent, thus becoming concrete examples of future trends and issues that require a robust approach towards security.","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=138415",""

Specifically, we examined the three-way interaction of in-role behavior, extra-role behavior, and politics perceptions on overall ratings of performance in a two-study, multilevel investigation. Across two studies, results generally were consistent with the hypothesized three-way interaction, such that the joint effects of extra-role and in-role behavior on performance ratings varied across levels of politics.

With the advent of using broadband technologies in buildings, office space and vehicle have become a necessity on a large scale. Models, predictions, and calculations for in-building, within a vehicle or near a reflective object with microscale details, are becoming highly classified in a competitive telecom environment. This paper provides an improved understanding of signal strength behavior within suburban residences with predictions prequalified using a vehicular scanner. Supporting predictions are provided by a ray tracing algorithm developed for dissertation. Results indicate signal strength variation of more than 50 dB from “strong signal” locations such as room centers and far corners to “weak signal” locations where shadowing and tunneling effects are evident. Based on this unique classification a scheme is proposed which indicates that specular scattering provides the major signal energy at more than 70% of the locations within the residences. Finally, an observed rake stabilizing effect is attributed to the proximity of strong scatterers.","http://downloads.hindawi.com/archive/2016/9846374.pdf",""

The status and factions theory of influence combines sociological insights about status generalization with psychological research on how the distribution of opinions promotes social influence. To date, several published studies support the logic of the theory, including how the effect of status varies with the distribution of opinions and the intervening theoretical mechanism. The former has been replicated a number of times, but only one study to date has truly tested the mechanism. Uncertainty reduction has been found to explain some of the joint effects of status and the distribution of opinions on social influence, but there is room for improvement. Consequently, after we discuss the existing literature, we identify additional mechanisms that may be worth pursuing in the future and also some applications of the theory's utility.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fsoc4.12435",""

To the extent that the OEMs are also concentrated, the interactions between the suppliers of critical components and the OEMs are strategic, and have implications for how an incumbent OEM chooses its product line and interacts with potential rivals. We demonstrate that, by adding a low‐end product line extension, an OEM can induce a strategic supplier to offer more favorable pricing. Moreover, depending upon the cost structure and relative performance of the product line extension, the OEM may benefit even more from the low‐end line extension if it is produced by a rival instead of by itself, even if it cannot obtain any licensing income from it. Among other things, we show that this can result in a decentralized OEM accommodating competition from rivals producing product line extensions that would not be developed in a vertically integrated supply chain. In an extension, we re‐examine the common assumption that the supplier unilaterally dictates a single wholesale price that is available to all downstream buyers. We demonstrate that, by committing to offer a “lowest available” wholesale price to all downstream buyers, a supplier can encourage an incumbent OEM to share its technology (or otherwise accommodate the entry of a rival) so that the supplier, the incumbent OEM, and the rival are all better off.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/poms.12541",""

In the Next Generation Science Standards, the primary conceptual learning goal is for learners to conserve energy as they track the transfers and transformations of energy within, into, or out of the system of interest in complex physical processes. As part of tracking energy transfers among objects, learners should (i) distinguish energy from matter, including recognizing that energy flow does not uniformly align with the movement of matter, and should (ii) identify specific mechanisms by which energy is transferred among objects, such as mechanical work and thermal conduction. As part of tracking energy transformations within objects, learners should (iii) associate specific forms with specific models and indicators (e.g., kinetic energy with speed and/or coordinated motion of molecules, thermal energy with random molecular motion and/or temperature) and (iv) identify specific mechanisms by which energy is converted from one form to another, such as incandescence and metabolism. Eventually, we may hope for learners to be able to optimize systems to maximize some energy transfers and transformations and minimize others, subject to constraints based in both imputed mechanism (e.g., objects must have motion energy in order for gravitational energy to change) and the second law of thermodynamics (e.g., heating is irreversible). We hypothesize that a subsequent goal of energy learning—innovating to meet socially relevant needs—depends crucially on the extent to which these goals have been met.","https://pubs.aip.org/aapt/pte/article-pdf/54/2/96/9865149/96_1_online.pdf",""

In 2012, a fourth method, provider-based sampling (PBS), tested a probability-based sampling of prenatal provider locations supplemented by a second cohort of neonates born at a convenience sample of maternity hospitals. METHODS:: From a sampling frame of 472 prenatal care provider locations and 59 maternity hospitals, 49 provider and 7 hospital locations within or just outside 3 counties participated in study recruitment. During first prenatal care visits or immediately postdelivery at these locations, face-to-face contact was used to screen and recruit eligible women. RESULTS:: Of 1450 screened women, 1270 were eligible. Consent rates at prenatal provider locations (62%–74% by county) were similar to those at birth locations (64%–77% by county). During 6 field months, 3 study centers enrolled a total prenatal cohort of 530 women (the majority in the first trimester) and during 2 months enrolled a birth cohort of an additional 320 mother-newborn dyads. As personnel became experienced in the field, the time required to enroll a woman in the prenatal cohort declined from up to 200 hours to 50 to 100 hours per woman recruited. CONCLUSIONS:: We demonstrated that PBS was feasible and operationally efficient in recruiting a representative cohort of newborns from 3 diverse US counties. Our findings suggest that PBS is a practical approach to recruit large pregnancy and birth cohorts across the United States.","https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-pdf/137/Supplement_4/S248/880621/peds_20154410f.pdf",""

Participants were 101 children aged 7–12 years with their primary caregivers and pet dogs. Children were randomly assigned in the TSST‐C to a pet present condition or one of two comparison conditions: parent present or no support figure present. Baseline, response, and recovery indices of perceived stress and cortisol levels were computed based on children's self‐reported feelings of stress and salivary cortisol. Results indicated that in the alone (no social support) condition, children showed the expected rise for both perceived stress and cortisol response to stress. Pet dog presence significantly buffered the perceived stress response in comparison to children in the alone and parent present conditions. No main condition effect was observed for cortisol; however, for children experiencing the stressor with their pet present, lower cortisol response to stress was associated with more child‐initiated petting and less dog proximity‐seeking behavior. The results support the notion that pet dogs can provide socio‐emotional benefits for children via stress buffering.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fsode.12203",""

Methods: Female Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned to one of five groups (n=8 each): control (CON), RT only, RT with EA (RT-EA), RT with HQ (RT-HQ), and RT combined with both EA and HQ (RT-EA-HQ). RT was performed using ladder climbing every other day for 8 weeks. Sparse-wave EA was applied for 15 min/day, 3 times/week for 8 weeks. HQ supplementation was provided via oral gavage daily for 8 weeks. Results: RT significantly increased the muscle mass of the flexor hallucis longus (FHL) compared to CON. The isometric twitch and tetanic tension of the FHL in the RT-EA, RT-HQ, and RT-EA-HQ groups were significantly higher compared to CON and RT groups. RT-EA treatment (with or without HQ) significantly increased GLUT4 protein concentration but had no impact on Akt-2. Conclusions: EA appears to be an effective treatment modality for increasing muscle mass and function when combined with RT. RT-EA may also be an effective method for improving glucose tolerance as a result of increases in GLUT4 protein concentration.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1136/acupmed-2015-011028",""

Without assessing whether the BHFS malfunction occurred in those studies, we constrain the possible underestimation of emissions associated with the BHFS-based results by excluding potentially affected measurements. Assuming leak emission rates are similar for sites with low and high methane content, U.S. methane emissions from equipment leaks and chemical injection pumps in recent studies could be underestimated by up to 40–80% due to a malfunctioning BHFS. We discuss uncertainties associated with this estimate. While a 40–80% underestimation is important when characterizing individual source categories, the potential implications are attenuated when aggregating emissions across the five sources examined in the recent studies (&lt;12–24%), across all sources in the natural gas production segment (&lt;7–14%), or across the entire supply chain (&lt;2–5%). Therefore, potential errors caused by BHFS malfunction in recent studies would not substantially alter estimates of methane emissions from the U.S. natural gas supply chain. The possible malfunction of such a widely-used instrument deserves further attention to ensure that its use in quantifying emissions from individual supply chain components is not compromised.","http://online.ucpress.edu/elementa/article-pdf/doi/10.12952/journal.elementa.000137/473587/174-1666-1-ce.pdf",""

Here we try to remove the influence of climate variability from the estimation of the anthropogenic contribution, which is an indicator of the environmental burden and important for TWS projections. Toward this end, we propose a linear relationship between the variation in water storage and precipitation. Factors related to the sensitivity of water storage to precipitation are given to correct for the climate variability, and the anthropogenic depletion of terrestrial water and groundwater in Asia is estimated to be −187 ± 38 Gt/yr and −100 ± 47 Gt/yr, respectively.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2F2016GL069985",""

During the Cooperative Indian Ocean Experiment on Intraseasonal Variability (CINDY)/Dynamics of the Madden–Julian Oscillation (DYNAMO) field campaign, two strong MJO events were observed within a month without a clear suppressed phase between them, and these events generated exceptionally strong ocean responses. Strong eastward currents along the equator in the Indian Ocean lasted more than one month from late November 2011 to early January 2012. The influence of these unique MJO events during the field campaign on ITF variability is investigated using a high-resolution (1/25°) global ocean general circulation model, the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM). The strong westerlies associated with these MJO events, which exceed 10 m s−1, generate strong equatorial eastward jets and downwelling near the eastern boundary. The equatorial jets are realistically simulated by the global HYCOM based on the comparison with the data collected during the field campaign. The analysis demonstrates that sea surface height (SSH) and alongshore velocity anomalies at the eastern boundary propagate along the coast of Sumatra and Java as coastal Kelvin waves, significantly reducing the ITF transport at the Makassar Strait during January–early February. The alongshore velocity anomalies associated with the Kelvin wave significantly leads SSH anomalies. The magnitude of the anomalous currents at the Makassar Strait is exceptionally large because of the unique feature of the MJO events, and thus the typical seasonal cycle of ITF could be significantly altered by strong MJO events such as those observed during the CINDY/DYNAMO field campaign.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jcli/article-pdf/29/17/6085/4072888/jcli-d-15-0711_1.pdf",""

Specifically, we focus on how bonding social capital within network organizations—measured as frequency of collaboration and degree of network coupling—can influence project performance outcomes both (a) directly by facilitating cooperative interaction and (b) contingently by mitigating the transaction costs associated with the management of complex projects. Using longitudinal data on contracted construction jobs to test our hypotheses, we find that project complexity is negatively related to project performance and bonding social capital has both direct and moderating effects. Contrary to expectations, however, we find that the different types of bonding social capital affect project performance uniquely and not always in an improved direction. Our findings suggest a more multifarious relationship than previous social capital research might imply.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1059601116650556",""

Previous researchers have determined the flow stress empirically as a function of mechanical state parameters such as strain, strain rate and temperature while ignoring the changes in the microstructural state such as alpha-beta phase transformations. This paper presents a new microstructure sensitive flow stress model based on the self-consistent method (SCM) that includes the effects of chemical composition, α phase and β phase, as well mechanical state imposed. This flow stress is developed to model the flow behavior of titanium alloys in machining, at speed of higher than 5m/s, characterized by extremely high strains (2∼10 or higher), high strain rates (104∼106s−1 or higher) and high temperatures (600∼1300°C). The flow stress sensitivity to mechanical and material parameters is analyzed. A new SCM-based Johnson-Cook (JC) flow stress model is proposed whose constants and ranges are determined using experimental data and the physical basis for SCM approach from literature. This new flow stress is successfully implemented in the finite element framework to simulate high speed machining process and compared with other types of flow stress models in terms of chip morphology. The predicted results confirm that the new model is much more effective and reliable than the original JC model in predicting chip segmentation in the high speed machining of titanium Ti-6Al-4V alloy.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/MSEC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/MSEC2016-8708/4425781/v001t02a043-msec2016-8708.pdf",""

In contrast to multinomial and nested logit (the prevailing choice models used for optimizing prices and assortments), this model assumes a negatively skewed distribution of consumer utilities, an assumption we motivate by conceptual arguments as well as published work. The choice probabilities in this model can be derived in closed form as an exponomial (a linear function of exponential terms). The pricing and assortment planning insights we obtain from the exponomial choice (EC) model differ from the literature in two important ways. First, the EC model allows variable markups in optimal prices that increase with expected utilities. Second, when prices are exogenous, the optimal assortment may exhibit leapfrogging in prices, i.e., a product can be skipped in favor of a lower-priced one depending on the utility positions of neighboring products. These two plausible pricing and assortment patterns are ruled out by multinomial logit (and by nested logit within each nest). We provide structural results on optimal pricing for monopoly and oligopoly cases, and on the optimal assortments for both exogenous and endogenous prices. We also demonstrate how the EC model can be easily estimated—by establishing that the log-likelihood function is concave in model parameters and detailing an estimation example using real data.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/opre.2015.1459",""

However, agreement between the two methods has been controversial. Recent development of high spatial and temporal resolution blood vessel wall edge-detection and wall-tracking methods with CDUS increased the accuracy and reliability of blood vessel diameter, hence cerebral blood flow measurement. The aim of this study was to compare the improved CDUS method with 3 T PC-MRI for cerebral blood flow measurements. We found that cerebral blood flow velocity measured in the ICA was lower using PC-MRI than CDUS (left ICA: PC-MRI, 18.0 ± 4.2 vs. CDUS, 25.6 ± 8.6 cm/s; right ICA: PC-MRI, 18.5 ± 4.8 vs. CDUS, 26.6 ± 6.7 cm/s, both p < 0.01).

Cerebral blood flow velocity measured in the left vertebral artery with PC-MRI was also lower than CDUS, but no differences in vertebral artery diameter were observed between the methods. Dynamic changes and/or intrinsic physiological fluctuations may have caused these differences in vessel diameter and velocity measurements between the methods. However, estimation of volumetric cerebral blood flow was similar and correlated between the methods despite the presence of large individual differences. These findings support the use of CDUS for cerebral blood flow measurements in the ICA and vertebral artery.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0271678X16631149",""

The cardioprotective mechanisms of IH are unknown. Myocardial ischemia‐reperfusion triggers overproduction of the powerful dicarbonyl glycating agent, methylglyoxal (MG), which injures cells by modifying arginyl and lysyl residues and, thus, inactivating enzymes and other proteins. The glyoxalase system detoxifies the modest amounts of MG normally generated by glycolysis, but this system may be insufficient to manage the excessive MG production induced by ischemia‐reperfusion. The enzyme components of this system are expressed and synthesized in response to reactive oxygen species, which are generated in myocardium by cyclic hypoxia‐reoxygenation. Purpose: This study evaluated IH induction of glyoxalase‐1 (GLO‐1), the rate‐controlling enzyme in the MG‐detoxifying glyoxalase cycle. Methods: Sprague‐Dawley rats (n=10) were conditioned by a 20 day IH program consisting of 5–8 daily, 5–10 min cycles of hypoxia (9.5–10% inspired O Results: GLO‐1 activity (U/mg protein) was increased threefold in myocardium of IH (0.53±0.08) vs. sham (0.17±0.06) rats (P<0.01), while activity of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione reductase was unchanged (IH: 0.0154±0.0057; sham: 0.023274±0.0043). Conclusion: IH augments the heart's anti‐glycation defenses, which may contribute to IH‐induced cardioprotection against ischemia‐reperfusion.","",""

METHODS: Patients diagnosed with nonmetastatic first primary lung cancer between 1973 and 2011 in the Metropolitan Detroit Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry were used for the current analysis. Age‐adjusted odds ratios of developing BM based on various demographic characteristics and histology were calculated with 95% confidence intervals. Adjusted Cox proportional hazard ratios and log‐rank tests of Kaplan‐Meier survival curves were calculated to evaluate survival differences for non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). RESULTS: The incidence of BM in patients with nonmetastatic NSCLC and SCLC was 9% and 18%, respectively. There was variation in the incidence of BM according to NCSLC histology. The incidence of BM was higher in patients aged <60 years for both NSCLC and SCLC, but there were no differences noted by race for either histological group. Female patients with NSCLC were more likely to have BM than male patients. There was variation in the proportion of BM in both patients with NSCLC and SCLC over the three 13‐year periods of diagnosis. The risk of death (hazard ratio) was found to be significantly higher for patients with NSCLC with BM, but was not significantly higher in patients with SCLC with BM.

Although mind-set specificity has been investigated for broad attributes such as personality and intelligence, less is known about mental health mind-sets (e.g., beliefs about anxiety) that have greater relevance to clinical science. In two studies, we took a latent variable approach to examine how different mind-sets (anxiety, social anxiety, depression, drinking tendencies, emotions, intelligence, and personality mind-sets) were related to one another and to psychological symptoms. Results provide evidence for both domain specificity (e.g., depression mind-set predicted depression symptoms) and generality (i.e., the anxiety mind-set and the general mind-set factor predicted most symptoms). These findings may help refine measurement of mental health mind-sets and suggest that beliefs about anxiety and beliefs about changeability in general are related to clinically relevant variables.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1948550616644657",""

The range of effective frequency is usually from 100 to 500 Hz, and low-frequency noise is a common disturbance in downhole monitoring. Conventional signal analysis techniques, such as band-pass filters, have their limitation in microseismic data processing when the useful signals and noise share the same frequency band. We have developed a novel method to suppress low-frequency noise in microseismic data based on mathematical morphology theory that aims at distinguishing useful signals and noise according to their tiny differences of waveform. By choosing suitable structure elements, we have extracted low-frequency noise from a original data set. We first developed the fundamental principle of mathematical morphology and the formulation of our approach. Then, we used a synthetic data example that was composed of a Ricker wavelet and low-frequency noise to test the feasibility and performance of the proposed approach. Our results from the synthetic example indicate that the proposed approach can effectively suppress large-scale low-frequency noise while slightly decreasing the small-scale signals. Finally, we have applied the proposed approach to field microseismic data and obtained very encouraging results.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/geo2015-0222.1",""

It is not clear how the ensemble is regulated in cells, aside from modulating levels of endogenous caspase inhibitors. We describe a library of caspase-3 variants with activities that vary by more than four orders of magnitude and show that removal of conserved water molecules may provide a strategy to design novel allosteric inhibitors that globally destabilize the active conformation within the ensemble. Our results suggest that posttranslational modifications fine-tune caspase activity by disrupting conserved water networks, and our database provides an approach to examine caspase signaling in cells by modifying caspase-3 activity while simultaneously maintaining endogenous enzyme levels.","http://www.pnas.org/syndication/doi/10.1073/pnas.1603549113",""

Methods: Working from transcripts of videotaped, treatment decision making consultations between breast cancer patients and surgeons, we identify all questions (by patients and companions) and then use grounded theory techniques to determine the most recurrent question‐asking themes. Results: Sample includes 132 recently diagnosed (M = 8.9 days), late‐middle‐aged (M = 61.2 years), female patients with predominantly early stage (0–1; 78%), first‐time breast cancer (92.4%) consulting with one of nine surgeons in community based offices. Transcripts contained 2,781 questions (1,929 by patients, 852 by companions; Cohen's Kappa = 0.90), which generated 15 patient question asking themes that were represented (i.e., asked about) at least once in >20% of all consultations. Conclusion: Question asking themes are a concrete index of what patients want to know more about prior to treatment. Identified themes specify, modify, and extend prior findings based on self‐report data. Findings potentially increase surgeons’ levels of patient centered care by improving surgeons’ abilities to satisfactorily address patients’ information needs, which has the potential to improve both patient outcomes and clinical practice guidelines.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fjso.24470",""

Background: Managing type 2 diabetes is challenging, particularly for underserved populations such as low‐income Hispanic women. This population segment has higher rates of type 2 diabetes, diabetes‐related complications, obesity, and sedentary lifestyles than the general U.S. population. Dietary management is a critical aspect of diabetes care, but it is perhaps the most difficult health behaviour to modify. Design: A qualitative and ethnographically based study was used. Methods: Participant observation and individual interviews explored the interrelationships of culture, food habits and type 2 diabetes among 12 low‐income Hispanic women residing in an impoverished rural community located on the Texas‐Mexico border. Results: Hispanic women used unique strategies to adjust their diet, particularly portion control; for example, they emphasised the ‘use of the fork’, based on the notion that Hispanic finger foods are less healthy. Women categorised foods as bad or acceptable, depending on the context, such as important family or social gatherings. Those with years of diabetes experience confidently took charge of the disease based on knowledge of their bodies and a desire to avoid complications, while acknowledging brief infractions of dietary ‘rules’ and balancing various social roles and expectations. Conclusions: Hispanic women manage their type 2 diabetes within a sociocultural environment. Those with expertise make changes in how they eat to care for their diabetes, but also continue to maintain traditional foodways. Relevance to clinical practice: Foodways are critical to most cultural groups and modifying dietary behaviours can be challenging. Clinicians must develop self‐management guidance within the sociocultural context of the patient if diabetes outcomes are to improve and be sustained.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fjocn.13291",""

To separately identify the role of the heavy oil and solid matrix under specific conditions, we have designed and performed special ultrasonic measurements for the heavy oil and heavy oil-saturated solids artificial samples. The measured data indicate that the viscosity of heavy oil reaches [Formula: see text] at the temperature of glass point, leading the heavy oil to act as a part of a solid frame of the heavy oil sand sample. The heavy oil is likely movable pore fluid accordingly once its viscosity dramatically drops to approximately [Formula: see text] at the temperature of liquid point. The viscosity-induced elastic modulus of heavy oil in turn makes the elastic properties of heavy oil-saturated grain solid sample to be temperature dependent. In addition, the rock physics model suggests that the microstructure of heavy oil sand is transitional; consequently, the solid Gassmann equation underestimates the measured velocities at the low temperature range of the quasisolid phase of heavy oil, whereas overestimates when the temperature exceeds the liquid point. The heavy oil sand sample has a higher modulus and approaches the upper bound due to the stiffer heavy oil itself acting as a rock frame as the temperature decreases.

However, in elephant seal pups, prolonged fasting does not suppress TH levels; it is associated with upregulation of adipose TH-mediated cellular mechanisms and adipose-specific insulin resistance. The functional relevance of this apparent paradox and the effects of glucose and insulin on TH-mediated signaling in an insulin-resistant tissue are not well defined. To address our hypothesis that insulin increases adipose TH signaling in pups during extended fasting, we assessed the changes in TH-associated genes in response to an insulin infusion in early- and late-fasted pups. In late fasting, insulin increased DI1, DI2, and THrβ-1 mRNA expression by 566%, 44%, and 267% at 60 min postinfusion, respectively, with levels decreasing by 120 min. Additionally, we performed a glucose challenge in late-fasted pups to differentiate between insulin- and glucose-mediated effects on TH signaling. In contrast to the insulin-induced effects, glucose infusion did not increase the expressions of DI1, DI2, and THrβ-1 until 120 min, suggesting that glucose delays the onset of the insulin-induced effects. The data also suggest that fasting duration increases the sensitivity of adipose TH-mediated mechanisms to insulin, some of which may be mediated by increased glucose. These responses appear to be unique among mammals and to have evolved in elephant seals to facilitate their adaptation to tolerate an extreme physiological condition.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpregu.00054.2015",""

We previously showed that memory B cells from relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients exhibited enhanced proliferation with CD40 stimulation compared with healthy donors. In this study, we used a multiparameter phosflow approach to analyze the phosphorylation status of NF-κB and three major MAPKs (P38, ERK, and JNK), the essential components of signaling pathways downstream of CD40 engagement in B cells from MS patients. We found that memory and naive B cells from RRMS and secondary progressive MS patients exhibited a significantly elevated level of phosphorylated NF-κB (p-P65) following CD40 stimulation compared with healthy donor controls. Combination therapy with IFN-β-1a (Avonex) and mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept) modulated the hyperphosphorylation of P65 in B cells of RRMS patients at levels similar to healthy donor controls. Lower disease activity after the combination therapy correlated with the reduced phosphorylation of P65 following CD40 stimulation in treated patients. Additionally, glatiramer acetate treatment also significantly reduced CD40-mediated P65 phosphorylation in RRMS patients, suggesting that reducing CD40-mediated p-P65 induction may be a general mechanism by which some current therapies modulate MS disease.","https://journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article-pdf/197/11/4257/1418353/1600782.pdf",""

The third chromosome of Drosophila pseudoobscura is a model system to test hypotheses about how rearrangements are established in populations because its third chromosome is polymorphic for &gt;30 gene arrangements that were generated by a series of overlapping inversion mutations. Circumstantial evidence has suggested that these gene arrangements are selected. Despite the expected homogenizing effects of extensive gene flow, the frequencies of arrangements form gradients or clines in nature, which have been stable since the system was first described &gt;80 years ago. Furthermore, multiple arrangements exist at appreciable frequencies across several ecological niches providing the opportunity for heterokaryotypes to form. In this study, we tested whether genes are differentially expressed among chromosome arrangements in first instar larvae, adult females and males. In addition, we asked whether transcriptional patterns in heterokaryotypes are dominant, semidominant, overdominant, or underdominant. We find evidence for a significant abundance of differentially expressed genes across the inverted regions of the third chromosome, including an enrichment of genes involved in sensory perception for males. We find the majority of loci show additivity in heterokaryotypes. Our results suggest that multiple genes have expression differences among arrangements that were either captured by the original inversion mutation or accumulated after it reached polymorphic frequencies, providing a potential source of genetic variation for selection to act upon. These data suggest that the inversions are favored because of their indirect effect of recombination suppression that has held different combinations of differentially expressed genes together in the various gene arrangement backgrounds.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/204/1/287/46823609/genetics0287.pdf",""

The system demonstrates the synergistic relationship between the two platforms by sharing different perspectives and information collected independently using their on-board sensors in performing a navigation task in an indoor environment, including avoiding obstacles and entering narrow pathways. The MAV uses an aerial view of the environment to develop an obstacle free path for the UGV using the A* algorithm. The UGV deploys the planned path in conjunction with information gathered from its own front facing camera to navigate through a cluttered environment using a Lyapunov stable sliding mode controller. The UGV is responsible for detecting low and narrow pathways and to guide the MAV to move through them. The bidirectional cooperation has been tested in hardware as well as in simulation, showing the system’s effectiveness.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/DSCC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/DSCC2016-9645/2375471/v002t24a002-dscc2016-9645.pdf",""

Prospective sources or reactive oxygen species (ROS) include mitochondria and NADPH oxidase‐2 (Nox2). We tested the causal role of Nox2 in unloading induced atrophy using a peptidyl inhibitor (gp91ds‐tat) with the following groups: ambulatory controls (CON), hindlimb unloaded for 7 days with scrambled sequence (HUScr), and unloading for 7 days + 5 mg/kg/day gp91dsTAT (HUG). Nox2 inhibition provided significant against HU‐induced reduction of plantarflexor muscle mass and soleus muscle fiber cross‐sectional area (CSA), measured using ImageJ and SMASH programs. There was a trend towards protection against a partial shift in fiber‐type shift from slow to fast twitch. Loss of sarcolemmal nNOSμ activity with HU, visualized using NADPH diaphorase and confirmed with immunofluorescence were also mitigated by gp91dsTAT. Gp91dsTAT also attenuated membrane localization of the Nox2 subunit p67phox. We conclude that Nox2 inhibition protects against muscle fiber atrophy and translocation of nNOSμ.","",""

Telomeres, protective “caps” at the end of chromosomes, modulate cellular aging and may be good biomarkers for the effects of chronic stress, including that associated with acculturation. The purpose of this analysis was to examine telomere length (TL) in acculturating Hispanic Mexican American women and to determine the associations among TL, acculturation, and psychological factors. As part of a larger cross-sectional study of 516 pregnant Hispanic Mexican American women, we analyzed DNA in blood samples ( N = 56) collected at 22–24 weeks gestation for TL as an exploratory measure using monochrome multiplex quantitative telomere polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We measured acculturation with the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans, depression with the Beck Depression Inventory, discrimination with the Experiences of Discrimination Scale, and stress with the Perceived Stress Scale. TL was negatively moderately correlated with two variables of acculturation: Anglo orientation and greater acculturation-level scores. We combined these scores for a latent variable, acculturation, and we combined depression, stress, and discrimination scores in another latent variable, “negative affectivity.” Acculturation and negative affectivity were bidirectionally correlated. Acculturation significantly negatively predicted TL. Using structural equation modeling, we found the model had an excellent fit with the root mean square error of approximation estimate = .0001, comparative fit index = 1.0, Tucker–Lewis index = 1.0, and standardized root mean square residual = .05. The negative effects of acculturation on the health of Hispanic women have been previously demonstrated. Findings from this analysis suggest a link between acculturation and TL, which may indicate accelerated cellular aging associated with overall poor health outcomes.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1099800416672005",""

For this examination, separate analyses were run on respondents with and without serious offending reported to determine whether predictors of police contact are different for individuals with whom the police presumably have more discretion (individuals who are not serious offenders). In addition, path models with logistic regression were created to examine potential indirect effects of all variables, including race. Results indicate that race does have an indirect effect on police contact, but it is White individuals who are more likely to be questioned and arrested. In addition, other factors including low parental socioeconomic status (which is associated with ethnicity), previous police contact, and gender are more likely, than even involvement in crime, to determine if a person will be questioned or arrested. Differences in predictors based on the seriousness of the offender and implications of the findings are discussed.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0734016816648188",""

Although MU can affect model calibration results, it is rarely incorporated in modeling practice. MU can be incorporated in two schemes: explicitly incorporated (MU‐EI) during model calibration and post‐processed (MU‐PP) after calibration is completed. In this study, both schemes are implemented in a case study of the Arroyo Colorado Watershed, Texas. Unexpectedly, no substantial differences were observed between each scheme for flow predictions. Although MU did not cause dramatic differences in most sediment and NH","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2F1752-1688.12401",""

The goal of this study was to assess available databases and present accurate data on the current otolaryngology workforce, examine methods for prediction of future health care needs, and explore potential issues with forecasting methods and policy implementation based on these predictions. Study Design: Retrospective analysis of research databases, public use files, and claims data. Methods: The total number of otolaryngologists and current practices in the United States was tabulated using the databases of the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery, American Medical Association, American Board of Otolaryngology, American College of Surgeons, Association of American Medical Colleges, National Center for Health Statistics, and Department of Health and Human Services. Otolaryngologists were identified as surgeons and classified into surgical groups using a combination of AMA primary and secondary self‐reported specialties and American Board of Medical Specialties certifications. Data gathered were cross‐referenced to rule out duplications to assess total practicing otolaryngologists. Data analyzed included type of practice: 1) academic versus private and 2) general versus specialty; and demographics: 1) urban versus rural, 2) patient age, 3) reason for visit (referral, new, established, surgical follow‐up), 4) reason for visit (diagnosis), and 5) payer type. Results: Analysis from the above resources estimates the total number of otolaryngologists practicing in the United States in 2011 to be 12,609, with approximately 10,522 fully trained practicing physicians (9,232–10,654) and 2,087 in training (1,318 residents and 769 fellows/others). Based on 2011 data, workforce projections would place the fully trained and practicing otolaryngology workforce at 11,088 in 2015 and 12,084 in 2025 unless changes in training occur. The AAO‐HNS Physicians Resource Committee performed an extensive analysis of collated data from multiple sources in 2014 and identified 10,800 practicing otolaryngologists and 2,087 in training. It is estimated that the current attrition rate is approximately 306 otolaryngologists per year. Percentage distribution of office visits by patient age was found to be 20% <15 years old, 7% 15 to 24 years old, 21% 25 to 44 years old, 32% 45 to 64 years old, 11% 65 to 74 years old, and 10% ≥75 years old. Reason for visit was 34% new, 29% chronic, 17% chronic with exacerbation, and 15% pre‐ or postsurgical follow‐up. The top diagnoses consisted of otitis media, chronic sinusitis, and impacted cerumen. Payer mix consisted of 59% private insurance, 19% Medicare, and 12% Medicaid/Children's Health Insurance Program. Conclusions: Despite past findings and predictions of 8,000 to 8,500 otolaryngologists practicing in the United States, collated data from above resources places the total at 12,887, with 10,800 fully trained and practicing in 2014. This 30% to 50% underestimation of the otolaryngology workforce has an impact on future predictions and resource utilization analysis. Even when this correction is considered, the available trained otolaryngologists required to serve the otolaryngologic health care needs of the US population are still insufficient and understaffed. The impact of an aging population and the estimated 30 to 47 million newly insured citizens under the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act are also unprecedented variables that must be considered. Further analysis of differences in physician productivity and geographic population density, and model formation of current otolaryngology workforce utilization, are needed to predict future public health needs.

The melting of orthorhombic lattice ordering under femtosecond optical excitation is found involving two distinct processes with different time scales, an initial fast melting of orthorhombic phase in about 4 ps and a subsequent slower transformation in 90 ps and longer timescales. The fast process is designated as the initial melting of orthorhombic phase induced by the Mn-O bond change that is most likely driven by the quenching of the dynamic Jahn-Teller distortion following the photo-excitation. The slow process is attributed to the growing of newly formed structure domain from the photo-excited sites to the neighboring non-excited orthorhombic sites.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.4960100/14482830/041905_1_online.pdf",""

As users learn to exploit the potential of networked communications, they participate in a process, which facilitates a shift from individual to collective contributions and introduces an opportunity for multi‐vocal and multi‐faceted representation of cultural heritage. Open access to crowdsourced collections requires reconsideration of the traditional authoritative approach of cultural heritage institutions. The arduous nature of the work rendered voluntarily in cultural heritage crowdsourcing initiatives calls for reconsideration of power relationships and giving power to devoted contributors supported by modern “intelligent” technology to regulate the process of representation and organization. Taking into consideration the fact that crowdsourced data are not without flaws, the question is how to better utilize the collective intelligence to create quality information. In this context, various issues such as power, control, trust, inter‐contributor consensus, heterogeneity of opinions will be raised and discussed by the panelists. Each of the panelists comes from a different field of expertise (Computer science, Information science, Economics, Communication studies, cultural heritage) and various cultural backgrounds and geographical locations (United States, Europe and Israel).

This phenomenon should preferably be studied using dietary ingredients that are relevant to human nutrition. This study was designed to evaluate the influence of whole-wheat, a food ingredient with several beneficial properties, on gut microorganisms of obese diabetic mice. Diabetic (db/db) mice were fed standard (obese-control) or whole-wheat isocaloric diets (WW group) for eight weeks; non-obese mice were used as control (lean-control).

Seeds were coated with teliospores and planted in autoclaved field soil in a growth chamber. Incidence of seedling infection at growth stage V3 differed between an inbred genotype of low susceptibility and those of moderate and high susceptibility, but did not differ between the high and moderately susceptible groups (P < 0.05). The real-time PCR assay was also used to compare infection status at early and late vegetative stages with observable symptoms in the field. We detected infection via real-time PCR in maize at both growth stages during field trials conducted in Texas and California but observed no disease symptoms (smutted ears or tassels). Notably, the fungus was present in up to 31% of the ear shoots in plots without disease symptoms. The real-time assay can be a useful tool for screening seedling-stage host resistance, and for better understanding the progress of infection in different maize genotypes. The field data suggest that asymptomatic infection is much more common than previously thought, and may have important implications for the epidemiology of this fungus under diverse plant resistance and growing conditions.","https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/pdf/10.1094/PHP-RS-15-0014",""

The authors contribute to the discussion by asserting that contemporary policing in America, and its relationship to racial inequality, is only the latest chapter in a broader historical narrative in which the police constitute the front line of a race- and class-stratified social order. In other words, contemporary criminal justice and race struggles are a legacy of colonialism. This essay begins with a brief overview of colonialism before turning toward dissecting the contemporary colonial character of policing African American urban ghetto communities in four parts. First, the emergence of ghettos as internal colonies is described. Second, mechanisms are given that propelled the mass entry of police into ghetto spaces, with particular attention given to the war on drugs, broken-windows and order-maintenance policing, and police militarization. Third, the authors explore how contemporary policing acts to manage the colonized through police stops, searches, and other practices. Finally, the relationship between American policing practices and cultural denigration of African Americans is described.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2332649216665639",""

The historical transition of farmers out of U.S. agriculture raises the question of whether Cooperative Extension and underlying Hatch‐funded research spending keeps farmers in agriculture or accelerates their exit. On balance, nearly 500,000 more farmers left than entered agriculture over the period studied. We estimate that without Extension, as many as 137,700 (or 28%) additional farmers would have disappeared on net. Overall, Extension programs are a remarkably cost effective way of keeping farmers in agriculture. Alternatively, shifting just 1.5% of federal farm program payments to Extension would have reduced net exits over this period by an estimated 11%, or 55,000 farmers.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1093/aepp/ppw007",""

The energy transfers in the samples are slower with a larger energy donor/acceptor gap, independent of the Raman spectra. The energy gap dependences of the nonresonant energy transfers cannot be described by the phonon compensation mechanism. Instead, the experimental energy gap dependences can be quantitatively described by the dephasing mechanism. Temperature dependences of resonant and nonresonant energy transfer rates in the melts are also consistent with the prediction of the dephasing mechanism. The series of results suggest that the dephasing mechanism can be dominant not only in solutions, but also in melts (pure liquids without solvents), only if the molecular motions (translations and rotations) are much faster than the nonresonant energy transfer processes.","https://pubs.aip.org/cps/cjcp/article-pdf/29/4/407/19744946/407_1_online.pdf",""

Ni45CoxMn45-xSn10 melt spun ribbons with x = 2, 4, 5, and 6 were characterized. The x = 5 sample was determined to exhibit the lowest transformation thermal hysteresis (7 K) and transformation temperature range during transformation from paramagnetic austenite to non-magnetic martensite, as well as a large latent heat of transformation (45 J kg−1 K−1). For this composition, it was found that increasing the grain size to thickness ratio of the ribbons from 0.2 to 1.2, through select heat treatments, resulted in a decrease in the magnetic field required to induce the martensitic transformation by about 3 T due to the corresponding reduction in the martensitic transformation temperature range. This decrease in the field requirement ultimately led to a larger magnetocaloric entropy change achieved under relatively smaller magnetic field levels. The giant inverse magnetocaloric effect of the optimized alloy was measured and showed that up to 25 J kg−1 K−1 was generated by driving the martensitic transition with magnetic fields up to 7 T.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.4960353/14885741/075101_1_online.pdf",""

We suggest that the usefulness of these discussions is partially limited by failure to consider the importance of wildlife “identity” rooted in freedom (i.e., how humans socially construct the “wildness” dimension of wild animals). To demonstrate the interrelations between identity and freedom, we explain that the class of subjects people care most about—partners, children, and people in general—typically should not be privately owned (i.e., chattel) because freedom (as opposed to slavery) is generally accepted as central to human identity, and its abrogation therefore degrades human identity. The degree to which this ethical argument applies to privatization of wildlife depends upon the relationship between freedom and the identity of wildlife as perceived by society. Thus, we suggest policy decisions regarding privatization of wildlife will be more accurately deliberated if society and wildlife professionals more completely considered the degree to which freedom is essential to a wild species’ identity and the degree to which that identity is inviolable. © 2016 The Wildlife Society.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fwsb.674",""

Using a simultaneous parallel interviewing procedure, we reviewed the literature, conducted qualitative interviews with, and solicited online feedback from Pagans, to write a manuscript on culturally-sensitive therapy with followers of Paganism. Our participant-informant experts indicated that Paganism is nature-oriented, rooted in historical beliefs and practices, polytheistic, and revering the feminine divine. Pagans believe in harming none and judging no one, celebrate many different holidays and worship rituals, believe in multiple deities, cosmic balance, Magic, and an afterlife, and often have spiritual or mystical experiences. Pagan character traits include open-mindedness, individualism, multiculturalism, experientialism, feminism, sex, and sexuality. Participants described encountering many stereotypes of Pagans, including evil Pagans, teenaged Goth chicks, witches, New Age Hippies, just a phase, sex-crazed perverts, and within- Pagan stereotypes. They described their attitudes about mental health and psychotherapy, and (perhaps idiosyncratic to our sample) they also described a process of religious identity development similar to the sexual identity development of people who are GLBT (gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgendered).

A dichotic listening paradigm was used in which different melodic sequences were presented to each ear, and listeners attended to (a) the left ear or the right ear or (b) the higher pitched tones or the lower pitched tones. Listeners judged whether tone-to-tone transitions within each melodic sequence moved upward or downward in pitch. Only musically experienced listeners could adequately judge the direction of successive pitch transitions when attending to a specific ear; however, all listeners could judge the direction of successive pitch transitions within a high-tone stream or a low-tone stream. Overall, listeners exhibited greater accuracy when attending to relatively higher pitches, but there was no evidence to support a right/high, left/low bias. Results were consistent with effects of attentional strategy rather than an ear advantage for high or low tones.

Conversely, when the misalignment is large, vertical dilution is suppressed when compared to the no‐swell case. Due to the strong directional shear of the mean flow within the OML, plume depth significantly impacts mean transport direction. The size of oil droplets in the plume also plays an important role in vertical dilution and mean transport direction.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2F2015JC011380",""

Efforts are underway to reduce the extent of hypoxic conditions through reductions in river nutrient inputs, but the response of hypoxia to such nutrient load reductions is difficult to predict because biological responses are confounded by variability in physical processes. The objective of this study is to identify the major physical model aspects that matter for hypoxia simulation and prediction. In order to do so, we compare three different circulation models (ROMS, FVCOM, and NCOM) implemented for the northern Gulf of Mexico, all coupled to the same simple oxygen model, with observations and against each other. By using a highly simplified oxygen model, we eliminate the potentially confounding effects of a full biogeochemical model and can isolate the effects of physical features. In a systematic assessment, we found that (1) model‐to‐model differences in bottom water temperatures result in differences in simulated hypoxia because temperature influences the uptake rate of oxygen by the sediments (an important oxygen sink in this system), (2) vertical stratification does not explain model‐to‐model differences in hypoxic conditions in a straightforward way, and (3) the thickness of the bottom boundary layer, which sets the thickness of the hypoxic layer in all three models, is key to determining the likelihood of a model to generate hypoxic conditions. These results imply that hypoxic area, the commonly used metric in the northern Gulf which ignores hypoxic layer thickness, is insufficient for assessing a model's ability to accurately simulate hypoxia, and that hypoxic volume needs to be considered as well.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2F2015JC011577",""

These competing perspectives motivate a lively debate in the organizational literature on the performance consequences of CEO power. To extend this line of inquiry, we examine the CEO power–firm performance relation during industry turmoil and delve into the role of three critical situational exigencies—managerial discretion, market competitiveness, and technological innovativeness.

Criminologists have theorized that a direct relationship exists between the association with criminal peers and the development of criminogenic thinking. The present study empirically explored the relationship between criminal associates and criminogenic thinking in 595 adult male inmates in the United States. It was hypothesized that the proportion of free time spent with and number of criminal associates would be associated with criminogenic thinking, as measured by two self-report instruments, the Measure of Offender Thinking Styles–Revised (MOTS-R) and the Psychological Inventory of Criminal Thinking Styles (PICTS). Hierarchal linear regression analyses demonstrated that the proportion of free time spent with criminal associates statistically predicted criminogenic thinking when controlling for demographic variables. The implications of these findings on correctional practice (including assessment and intervention) as well as future research are discussed.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0306624X15599605",""
