The purpose of this research was to determine the effects of 2-week 16:8-hour intermittent fasting on body composition. Participants ages ranged from 21-24 years, with a total of four (males: 3, female: 1), all college aged students. All participants were involved in regular exercise but had no previous experience of intermittent fasting. Each participant consumed their normal dietary intake till day of pre-intervention testing but were told to be in a fasted state before undergoing baseline testing. A glucometer was used to evaluate fasted blood glucose. Blood pressure was determined by using a manual cuff. A stadiometer was used to measure participants height and weight. A flexible tape measure was used to determine the waist and hip circumferences, which were used to determine the waist to hip ratio. Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis and Skinfold Calipers were used to determine body composition. Participants maintained normal physical activity levels, and logged volume and intensities in the MyFitnessPal application. Participants followed an isocaloric intake. Participants followed a 16:8 ratio, with a 16 hour fast and 8 hours allotted to consume food. Participants followed the intermittent fasting diet for a total of two weeks. Post-intervention was reevaluated at the two-week mark following intervention start. Data was presented as mean ± standard deviation and determined by descriptive analysis. Statistical significance was set at p < .05. The results may indicate that intermittent fasting with a 16:8 ratio can decrease body mass and resting blood pressure in young individuals. Due to COVID-19, limitations were placed allotting only 2 weeks for intervention and for smaller sample size. For future research, study would be increased to 8 weeks with an increased sample size up.","",""

The availability of VGI, such as social media and crowdsourced data, empowered the researchers to monitor and model floods in near-real-time by integrating multi-sourced data available. Nevertheless, the quality of VGI sources and its reliability for flood monitoring (e.g. WD) is not well understood and validated by empirical data. Moreover, existing literature focuses mostly on text messages but not the multimedia nature of VGI.

However, very little research investigates how the caregiving experience may impact an individual’s subjective aging experience. Various aspects of subjective aging have been implicated in health outcomes and memory function (Brothers et al., 2017; Stephan, Sutin, Caudroit, & Terracciano, 2016). The purpose of this study was to investigate the differences in perceptions of subjective aging between caregivers and non-caregivers. Participants (N = 185) completed a survey assessing several aspects of subjective aging, including subjective age, or how old an individual feels, memory function, well-being, attitudes towards aging, and aging stereotypes. A series of independent t-tests indicated that there were significant differences between groups on subjective age (p = .013), and subjective memory function (p = .013). Caregivers (n = 93) reported feeling significantly older than their chronological age, reported significantly more subjective memory complaints, and also reported poorer subjective memory function when compared to the non-caregiver (n = 92) control group. Previous literature does suggest that older subjective age ratings are associated with poor subjective memory function, so these results are not necessarily surprising. However, these results suggest that caregiving for individuals with ADRD may negatively impact caregivers’ perceptions of their own aging experience, but not necessarily their perceptions about aging in general.","https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/5/Supplement_1/792/43187765/igab046.2922.pdf",""

TES has a multitude of uses; from simply boiling a kettle of water on a stove to more complex applications such as solar power generation. This research focuses on the application of a thermal energy storage unit introduced to a selected Phase Change Material (PCM) to undergo controlled experimentation. It helpful to gain understanding of how the TES unit will perform in a typical laboratory environment. A PCM is any substance capable of absorbing or releasing sufficient energy to undergo a phase transition. For specified purposes of this work was, the relevant states of matter liquid and solid; hence the use of a paraffin wax was the ideal for the experimental work model where the phase transition from solid to liquid occurs in a relatively low temperature. The objective of this work was determining the amount of energy that can be stored, and the power that can be generated by using paraffin wax. The setup of the experimental work for this project was consisting of a wax chamber, corrugated steel plates, and gaskets compressed within two plexiglass frames with an inlet and outlet. Tap water was used the medium of transferring thermal energy, and a JULABO heating unit was used to generate enough thermal energy for the steel plates. PCM was used to absorb the energy and transfer it to the cold water during the PCM transformation. A normal faucet was to provide cool enough water to lower the temperature within the system initiating the liquid to solid phase transition. Hoses was used to connect the main TES unit, JULABO unit, and faucet, as well as allowing flow throughout the system. Experiential work and calculation model results shows that the energy recovery was effected by flow rates, melting temperatures, and PCM.

Because of the versatile nature of latent heat thermal energy storage systems, it is pertinent to conduct further studies. SolidWorks is used to create precise 3D models of Tranter Heat Exchanger Components. This purpose is to extract the volume between plates of an actual Tranter Heat Exchanger System. Also, in this model, located in a custom-made chamber of Poly (Methyl Methacrylate) or plexiglass, contacting the heat exchanger plate is the volume in which the phase change material (PCM) is stored to be melted and retrieved to obtain stored energy. A PCM is a medium that is capable of absorbing and releasing energy as the phase changes occur in low temperature, in our case from solid to liquid and conversely. Due to this process, it is necessary to study the various types of latent heat storage materials. Transient heat transfer analysis is conducted to investigate low temperature energy storage using corrugated thermal flow channel for lower temperature applications. The enthalpy porosity method is applied to simulate model in pure conduction. The PCM used in the study is the Paraffin C22−C45 packed in the chamber and contacted to corrugated stainless steel plate. Energy storage into PCM and energy retrieval from PCM is simulated in turbulent flow of the heat transfer fluid. Other key variables consist of time temperature, pressure, turbulent type flow, and properties of H2O and Paraffin C22−C45. The use of ANSYS Software can determine distribution of heat throughout the unit, and witness the melting process simultaneously unlike in physical testing. Due to the simulation’s quick nature, relative to physical testing, in future, multiple experiments can be performed with various phase change materials, calculations on the total energy stored can be performed quickly, and power recovery can be estimated based on the simulation results. The novelty of the work is demonstrated in simulation of PCM that is stored above a volume generated from combined complex ‘chevron’ shaped plates. The goal is to compare the results of the simulation to corresponding simulations. Due to the nature of the plate and its arrangement, it is correctly observed from the simulation that the melting of the PCM begins at the center of the plate where maximum heat transfer takes place.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2021-68202/6828192/v08at08a031-imece2021-68202.pdf",""

We hypothesized that mitochondrial function and capacity would be impaired in heat stressed (HS) compared to thermoneutral (TN) pigs but mitochondrially-targeted coenzyme Q (MitoQ) supplementation would rescue the impairment. Oxidative portions of the semitendinosus muscle were evaluated from TN and HS gilts receiving no supplementation (CON) or MitoQ for 2 d prior to and during the 24h environmental heat treatment (n = 8 per group). Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (P) and electron transfer (E) capacities were determined via high resolution respirometry and mitochondrial volume density and function were quantified by citrate synthase (CS) and cytochrome c oxidase activities, respectively. Data were analyzed using linear models in SAS v9.4 with fixed effects of heat, MitoQ treatment (trt), and heat×trt interaction. There were trends for the interaction of trt and heat (P≤0.1) on integrative (per mg tissue) and intrinsic (relative to CS) P with complexes I and II (PCI+II), maximum noncoupled E (ECI+II), and E with complex II only (ECII), in which all measures were greater in HS-MitoQ than TN-MitoQ (P≤0.03), but measures did not differ due to HS in CON pigs. The contribution of leak to total E (flux control ratio, FCRLeak) was lesser in HS-MitoQ than HS-CON, TN-CON, and TN-MitoQ (P≤0.02). The FCRPCI was greater (P≤0.05) while the FCRPCI+II was lesser (P=0.01) in TN compared to HS pigs.

This included Title 42, which deported asylum seekers immediately and prevented them from applying for asylum. These measures worsened an already precarious situation at the US–Mexico border for an estimated 60,000 asylum seekers who were prevented, by the Trump administration’s ‘Remain in Mexico’ (aka MPP) policy enacted in January 2019, from remaining in the United States while they awaited their asylum hearings. In-depth interviews, participant observation, and social media analysis with humanitarian and legal advocates for asylum seekers living in a camp at the border in Matamoros, Mexico reveal that COVID-19’s impacts are not limited to public health concerns. Rather, COVID-19’s impacts center on how the Trump administration weaponized the virus to indefinitely suspend the asylum system. We argue that the Matamoros refugee camp provides a strategic vantage point to understand the repercussions of state policies of exclusion on im/mobility and survival strategies for asylum seekers. Specifically, we use the analytical lenses of the politics of im/mobility, geographies of exclusion, and asylum seeker resilience to identify how COVID-19 has shaped the im/mobility and security of the camp and its residents in unexpected ways. At the same time, our research illustrates that camp residents exercise im/mobility as a form of political visibility to contest and ameliorate their precarity as they find themselves in conditions not of their choosing.","https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/10/2/47/pdf",""

A process is described to examine nano-diamond seeding densities 4 × 108, 8 × 1010, and 2 × 1012 cm−2 on silicon wafers. The diamond film is grown using hot-filament chemical vapor deposition with CH4/H2/O2 feed gases and varying growth time to determine properties at coalescence and as thickness increases. Polycrystalline morphology is examined by scanning electron and atomic force microscopy. Both vertical and lateral growth rates are found to be higher for sparse seeding prior to coalescence. Following coalescence, the growth rate is similar for all densities. The development of polycrystals is found to be influenced by the initial growth with smaller mean lateral size at higher seeding density and reduced surface roughness that also improves with thickness to reach ≲90 nm at a thickness of 6.4 μm. The crystal quality is examined by micro-Raman spectroscopy from the sample surfaces and line images from cross sections. Narrowing of the diamond phonon peak shows material quality to improve with the thickness, at a given seed density, and as density increases. Concomitant improvements are seen from the relative intensity of the diamond phonon and Raman bands from non-diamond carbon. Cross-section micro-Raman results suggest improved diamond film quality and crystallinity near the substrate interface as well as at the growth surface for the film grown with 2 × 1012 cm−2 seed density compared to 4 × 108 and 8 × 1010 cm−2.

We develop a number of spatial mechanisms to assess how these intermediary factors limit and/or enhance the effect of FDI on economic growth. In particular, we test whether different levels of resource rents, severity of civil conflict and openness to international trade are statistically different in attenuating direct and indirect (spillover) effects of inbound FDI on growth. Last, we conduct a test of asymmetry to investigate whether the effect of FDI on growth is statistically different from zero in three democratic (autocratic) regimes, that is, low democratic (high autocratic), moderate democratic–autocratic and high democratic (low autocratic) societies. A number of insightful contributions to the economic growth‐FDI literature can be extracted from our analyses. First, results indicate that inbound FDIs on their own have positive and significant effect on economic growth. However, the positive FDI effect on growth is significantly dampened by the negative intermediary role of civil conflict. Second, we find that, the more opened sub‐Saharan African economies are to international trade, the greater is the impact of FDI on growth. However, trade among African countries as a share of their economies plays insignificant intermediation role on direct and indirect effects of FDI on growth. Third, we find that an increase in resource rents as a share of the economy significantly reduces direct and spillover effects of inbound FDI on economic growth. Last, our analysis indicates that both low democratic (high autocratic) and high democratic (low autocratic) regimes do accelerate the positive impact of FDI on growth. However, results indicate a slow‐down effect of FDI on growth under moderate democratic–autocratic regimes. This particular finding suggests that the intermediary role of democracy in determining the effect of FDI on economic growth is non‐linear. A number of policy implications can be extrapolated from our analysis. Most importantly, trade policies, which boost integration of sub‐Saharan African countries and open up the continent to the rest of the world, are likely to play major intermediation roles in accelerating the positive effect of FDI on growth.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/twec.13167",""

Studies have yet to determine the role of visfatin and resistin in liver cancer, specifically in the context of obesity. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of neutralizing visfatin and resistin in obese (OB) or normal weight (NW) sera to determine the contribution of these proteins in obesity-induced invasive liver cancer. Sera from OB or NW males was used to determine the efficacy of neutralizing visfatin and resistin to reduce the obesity-induced liver cancer phenotype. HepG2 and SNU-449 cells were exposed to OB and NW sera ± antibodies for visfatin or resistin. The neutralizing antibodies differentially suppressed invasion, reactive oxygen species production, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 secretion. These changes corresponded with a decrease in phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases and protein kinase B in HepG2 cells, but differences were not observed in CAP1 or β-catenin.

The research questions guiding the study are: (1) What does the professional socialization of foreign-born scholars into U.S. academe entail? (2) What is traditionally expected of a scholar starting an academic career? (3) How can emergent scholars systematically reflect and learn about the profession? Video-conference meetings, transcripts and notes, email messages, and individual written reflective journal entries constitute the data collection sources. The narratives collected were analyzed following the constant comparative method: (a) comparing different people, (b) comparing data from same individual at different points in time, (c) comparing incident with incident, (d) comparing data with category, and (e) comparing category with other categories. In addition, selective coding, grouping categories to reduce data, synthesizing, and explaining the data, were also part of the data analysis process. Meaningful narratives support the results of the analysis and illustrate study findings through four themes: The holy trinity of academia, role models and mentors, matrix of professional socialization, and lessons learned. The need to re-conceptualize the professional socialization process of emergent scholars became evident. Without a doubt, to succeed in the U.S. academe, emergent scholars must prepare for teaching, research, and service expectations.

Improvement of these methods beyond P3HT is key to enabling the widespread application of PTs. In this work, P3HT and two ether-substituted PTs poly(2-dodecyl-2H,3H-thieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxine) (PEDOT-C12) and poly(3,4-bis(hexyloxy)thiophene) (PBHOT) are synthesized by the FeCl3-initiated oxidative method under different conditions.

Gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) was performed to determine the impact of the different methods on the molecular weights (Mw) and degree of polymerization (Xw) of the polymers relative to polystyrene standards. The standard addition method produced ether-substituted PTs with higher Mw and Xw than those produced using the reverse addition method for sterically unhindered monomers. For P3HT, the highest Mw and Xw were obtained using the reverse addition method. The results show the oxidation potential of the monomer and solution has the greatest impact on the yield and Xw obtained and should be carefully considered when optimizing the reaction conditions for different monomers.","https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/14/20/6146/pdf",""

Although many have relied on the Kissick model to advocate for health policy decisions, to our knowledge the model has never been empirically tested. Some have called for policy makers to come to terms with the premise of the Kissick model tradeoffs, while others have questioned the model, given the proliferation of quality-enhancing initiatives, automation, and information technology in the health care industry. One wonders whether these evolutionary changes alter or disrupt the originality of the Kissick paradigms themselves. Methods: Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to evaluate the Kissick hypothetical relationships among the unobserved constructs of cost, quality, and access in hospitals for the year 2018. Hospital data were obtained from Definitive Healthcare, a subscription site that contains Medicare data as well as non-Medicare data for networks, hospitals, and clinics (final n = 2766). Results: Reporting significant net effects as defined by our chosen study variables, we find that as quality increases, costs increase, as access increases, quality increases, and as access increases, costs increase.

Underneath a submarine landslide in the Orca Basin, Gulf of Mexico, in 3D seismic data we map an irregular bottom simulating reflection (BSR), which mimics the geometry of the pre-slide seafloor rather than the modern bathymetry. Based on the observed BSR, we suggest that the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) is currently adjusting to the post-slide sediment temperature perturbations. We apply transient conductive heat flow modeling to constrain the response of the GHSZ to the slope failure, which yields a most likely age of ~8 ka demonstrating that gas hydrate systems can respond to slope failures even on the millennia timescales.

Visfatin has anti-apoptotic, proliferative, and metastatic properties and may mediate its effects via ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling. Studies have yet to determine whether inhibition of kinase signaling will suppress visfatin-induced liver cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine which signaling pathways visfatin may promote liver cancer progression. Methods: HepG2 and SNU-449 liver cancer cells were exposed to visfatin with or without ERK or PI3K/Akt inhibitor, or both inhibitors combined. These processes that were assessed: proliferation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipogenesis, invasion, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP). Results: Inhibition of PI3K/Akt and combination of inhibitors suppressed visfatin-induced viability. ERK inhibition in HepG2 cells decreased visfatin-induced proliferation. ERK inhibitor alone or in combination with PI3K inhibitors effectively suppressed MMP-9 secretion and invasion in liver cancer cells. PI3K and ERK inhibition and PI3K inhibition alone blocked visfatin’s ROS production in SNU-449 cells.

To better understand how the U.S Veterans health outcomes compared to non-Veterans, this study utilized the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset to examine 10 different self-reported morbidities. Yearly age-adjusted, population estimates from 2003 to 2019 were used for Veteran vs. non-Veteran. Complex weights were used to evaluate the panel series for each morbidity overweight/obesity, heart disease, stroke, skin cancer, cancer, COPD, arthritis, mental health, kidney disease, and diabetes.

As societies worldwide experience the growth of aging populations who are at higher risk of having chronic diseases as they age, clinicians and researchers should assess and address loneliness of older adults with chronic diseases. Methods: This systematic review synthesizes research found in PubMed, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, CINAHL, and SocINDEX. Findings: fourteen studies were conducted in four countries and represented n= 128,610. Loneliness was measured by three different instruments. Reports of loneliness were frequent and ranged from 7.7% (in a report of severe loneliness) to 43.2% (moderate loneliness) of older adults. Older adults who experienced loneliness were less likely to be physically active, eat a healthy diet, or cope in positive ways and more likely to be female and seek healthcare. Conclusions: This systematic review found that loneliness was moderately prevalent, and that loneliness was associated with negative disease self-management behaviors in older adults with chronic diseases. Gaps in the research include a need for studies guided by theoretical pathways, using a consistent, theoretically-based measure of loneliness, and conducted on among people with specific chronic diseases.","https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/5/Supplement_1/624/43187012/igab046.2380.pdf",""

Here, we compared by microarray hybridization the mRNA levels in pooled DLP tissues and individual neuroendocrine carcinomas to characterize potential molecular targets of AGN extract and D/DA. Clustering and principal component analyses supported distinct gene expression profiles of TRAMP DLP versus neuroendocrine carcinomas. Pathway Enrichment, Gene Ontology, and Ingenuity Pathway Analyses of differential genes indicated that AGN and D/DA affected chiefly processes of lipid and mitochondrial energy metabolism and oxidation-reduction in TRAMP DLP, while AGN affected neuronal signaling, immune systems and cell cycling in neuroendocrine carcinomas. Protein–Protein Interaction Network analysis predicted and reverse transcription-PCR verified multiple hub genes common in the DLP of AGN- and D/DA-treated TRAMP mice at 28 WOA and select hub genes attributable to the non-D/DA AGN components. The vast majority of hub genes in the AGN-treated neuroendocrine carcinomas differed from those in TRAMP DLP. In summary, the transcriptomic approach illuminated vastly different signaling pathways and networks, cellular processes, and hub genes of two TRAMP prostate malignancy lineages and their associations with the interception efficacy of AGN and D/DA. Prevention Relevance:: This study explores potential molecular targets associated with in vivo activity of AGN root alcoholic extract and its major pyranocoumarins to intercept precancerous epithelial lesions and early malignancies of the prostate. Without an ethically-acceptable, clearly defined cancer initiation risk reduction strategy available for the prostate, using natural products like AGN to delay formation of malignant tumors could be a plausible approach for prostate cancer prevention.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerpreventionresearch/article-pdf/14/6/635/3100057/635.pdf",""

If tested too soon after calving, false positive readings can occur due to elevated concentrations from the previous pregnancy. This study’s objective was to determine factors that impact clearance of PAGs in postpartum beef females. Blood samples were collected from postpartum Angus and Angus-cross females (primiparous n = 46 and multiparous n = 58); once a week for up to 14 weeks after calving (range of first to last sample 1–7 to 98–105 days postpartum; dpp). Serum was tested in duplicate using the IDEXX Alertys Pregnancy Test. Data were analyzed as a repeated measure using the MIXED procedure of SAS (9.4) with parity, calf sex (sex), days postpartum, and all interactions in the model. Data were analyzed using the REG procedure in SAS. There was a significant effect of dpp (P &lt; 0.01) on PAG concentrations; however, PAG concentrations were not influenced by parity (P = 0.24), sex (P = 0.49), parity by dpp (P = 0.12), parity by sex (P = 0.65), sex by dpp (P = 0.37), or parity by sex by dpp (P = 0.99). Concentrations of PAGs rapidly decreased from d 0 to 50 postpartum and then continued to gradually decrease to d 100. Days postpartum accounted for 67.53% of the variation in PAG concentrations. Prior to 50 dpp, PAG concentrations were sufficiently elevated which resulted in false positive readings (S – N ≥ 0.3). In summary, concentrations of PAGs remained elevated after calving, but the clearance of PAGs were not impacted by parity or sex of the calf. Clearance of PAGs were significantly influenced by days postpartum. Additionally, using a blood pregnancy test prior to d 50 postpartum would increase the likelihood of false positive readings due to residual PAG concentrations from the previous pregnancy.","http://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/99/Supplement_3/123/40528697/skab235.226.pdf",""

The city of Austin is one of the ten cities in the US undergoing rapid urban gentrification; however, there is insufficient empirical evidence on the impact of this process on residents’ health. Consequently, this study explored the concept of weathering and life course perspective using data of 331 residents recruited from two regions endemic with gentrification to assess the health impacts of gentrification. We used a triangulation method including univariate, bivariate correlation, and multiple linear regression implemented through the structural equation model to examine the complex pathways to three health outcomes—measured stress, self-rated mental health, and depression symptoms. Bivariate Pearson’s correlation indicated a significant positive association between gentrification score and mental health symptoms and stress. However, the direct association between gentrification and depression disappeared in the causal/path model. In support of the weathering hypothesis, this study found that stress score was directly related to the adulthood depression score. Therefore, this research builds on the accumulating evidence of environmental stress and mental health in the US’s rapidly changing physical and sociocultural environment. Hence, implementing and guaranteeing social equity of resources will improve residents’ health and reduce the cost of health care spending at both the household level and the city government level.","https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/openhe-2021-0002/xml",""

Thus, the current system fails to accommodate the particular needs of LDISs, which, in addition to further developing their academic language proficiency, includes navigating multicultural perspectives and potentially unfamiliar instructional practices. To understand the current situation in this regard in order to provide evidence‐based practical recommendations, a need for exploration of instructors’ and institutions’ readiness is warranted. To attend to this critical need, this study asks: What are the professional knowledge base and dispositions of faculty in educator preparation programs about linguistic and academic matters to meet the needs of LDISs? What pedagogical choices by faculty in educator preparation programs particularly address the linguistic and academic needs of LDISs? What institutional readiness‐related affordances exist to support LDISs and faculty in participants’ experiences? Data sources include interviews and institutional documents. The findings indicate that faculty members acknowledge a lack of a) personal/professional knowledge and skills about linguistically and culturally responsive education, b) institutional readiness, and c) to some degree, ability to correctly identify instructional remedies (e.g., strategies) in addressing the needs of linguistically diverse students.

Research notes that both married and cohabiting couples effectively respond to difficult situations by sharing the ownership of a stressor and organizing a collaborative, collective response. However, little is known about the influence of religion on shared coping experiences, particularly among older African American couples. This study examined dyadic data from the Strong African American Couples Project to capture the influence of relational sanctification on the communal coping practices of married and cohabiting older African American couples. The sample included 194 African American couples (146 married and 48 cohabiting) between the ages of 50 and 86 years. With the use of Actor Partner Independence Models, this study found that men’s sanctification predicted both their own communal coping and their partner’s communal coping. However, there were no significant effects when women’s sanctification was used as a predictor of communal coping among older African American couples. These findings are both important and novel, because these relationships had never before been examined within the United States, much less among older African American couples. Similar to existing research among majority White couples, this research finds that men’s religiosity may be a more influential predictor of relational outcomes than women’s religiosity. Such findings offer a valuable foundation for future studies seeking to consider how relational sanctification and communal coping may impact other outcomes associated with the romantic relationships of older African Americans.","https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/5/Supplement_1/463/43183631/igab046.1790.pdf",""

Results: Among the 30 articles that met the inclusion criteria, three initiatives healthcare organizations have taken to maintain throughput were identified: the use (and enhanced use) of telehealth, protocol development, and health care provider training.

Conclusions: To maintain patient throughput during the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare organizations need to develop strategies such as the use of virtual consultation and follow-up, new guidelines to move patients along the care delivery value-chain, and ongoing training of providers. Additionally, the availability of required technology for telehealth, availability of resources, and adequate knowledge are vital for continuous patient throughput to ensure continuity of care during a pandemic.","https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/9/11/1474/pdf",""

Further, despite positive associations between religiosity and age, particularly among African Americans, a dearth of dyadic data consider the importance of religious constructs within the relationships of older African Americans. To address this gap, this study utilized dyadic data from the Strong African American Couples Project to examine the interconnection between relational sanctity and forgiveness among married and cohabiting older African American couples. A total of 194 African American couples (146 married and 48 cohabiting) aged 50 to 86 years were included in the analysis, and Actor Partner Independence Models were used to test the relational effects of sanctity and forgiveness. Findings revealed that no significant effects existed when women’s relational sanctity was the predictor variable. However, men’s relational sanctity had a significant positive association with both his own forgiveness of his partner and his perception of his partner’s forgiveness. These findings have valuable implications for professionals engaging older African American couples. First, this study helps to counter the often deficit-focused literature on African American couples by highlighting the potentially stabilizing influence of viewing one’s relationship as sacred. Second, this study offers a rare glimpse into the aspects of men’s religiosity that may be more consequential than women’s. Both practitioners and clergy could use this information to inform counseling efforts that seek to build on the strengths of married and cohabiting older African American couples.","https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/5/Supplement_1/921/43188886/igab046.3338.pdf",""

Instead, existing literature notes that older African Americans frequently utilize informal social support networks (e.g., church leaders) to respond to stress and buffer the negative effects of depression and depressive symptoms. Yet, little is known about the shared coping practices of older African American couples in relation to depression. Given the commonly noted high levels of religiosity among African Americans, this study examined communal coping as a mediator between sanctification and depression for older African American couples. This study utilized the dyadic data of 194 (146 married and 48 cohabiting) African American couples between the ages of 50 and 86 years. Capturing data with the Revised Sanctification of Marriage scale, the Communal Coping scale, and the Major Depression Inventory, bias-corrected bootstrap analysis revealed that men’s relationship sanctification and women’s depression was partially mediated by men’s, as well as the sum of men’s and women’s, communal coping in married couples. Further, men’s relationship sanctification and men’s depression was partially mediated by men’s, as well as the sum of men’s and women’s, communal coping. In addition, women’s sanctification was positively associated with men’s depression, directly.

The progress of OLEDs in the market over their inorganic counterpart is principally due to their cost savings, flexibility, and excellent performance. As a result of the rising demands for next‐generation electronic devices with increased efficiency, high flexibility, reduced cost, and stretchability, there is a need for improvements of OLEDs. In order to fulfill these requirements, it is necessity to replace the transparent conductive electrode (TCE) with a better alternative. The conventionally used TCE, indium tin oxide (ITO), suffers from the scarcity of indium, increased cost, instability, and brittleness. Graphene is recognized as a suitable alternative to ITO because of its excellent properties including high optical transmittance, outstanding electrical conductivity, stability, and great mechanical flexibility. However, the performance of graphene as the TCE material in OLEDs is limited. Several efforts have been made to improve graphene's performance through electrode modifications. This review covers a summary of fabrication techniques for graphene‐based TCEs and their improvements. Finally, the application and performance of graphene‐based TCEs in OLED devices and the performance of such OLEDs are discussed.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/adom.202002102",""

Our reporter strain tagged with NL was more than 100 times brighter than P. syringae tagged with the luxCDABE operon from Photorhabdus luminescens, one of the existing luciferase-based strains. In planta imaging was improved by using the surfactant Silwet L-77, particularly at a lower reporter concentration. Using this imaging system, more than 30 epigenetic mutants were analyzed for their resistance traits because the defense signaling pathway is known to be epigenetically regulated. SWC1, a defense-related chromatin remodeling complex, was found to be a positive defense regulator, which supported one of two earlier conflicting reports. Compromises in DNA methylation in the CG context led to enhanced resistance against virulent Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. Dicer-like and Argonaute proteins, important in the biogenesis and exerting the effector function of small RNAs, respectively, showed modest but distinct requirements for effector-triggered immunity and basal resistance to P. syringae pv. tomato. In addition, the transcriptional expression of an epigenetic component was found to be a significant predictor of its immunity contribution.

The purpose of applying stents is to help relieve the urine flow while the ureter is either blocked or trying to close itself, which creates blockages. These ureteral stents, while necessary, cause pain and discomfort to patients due to them being a solid that moves around inside the patients’ body. The ureter normally moves urine to the bladder through peristaltic forces. Due to the ureter being a hyperelastic material, these peristaltic forces cause the ureter to deform easily, making it necessary for the stent to properly move the urine that flows through it for the patient not to face further medical complications. In this study, we seek to find a relation between the amount of stent side holes and the overall flow rate inside the stent with the ureter contracting due to peristalsis. A fully coupled fluid-structure interaction (FSI) model is developed to visualize how the ureter deforms due to peristalsis and the subsequent effect on the urine flow due to the ureter’s deformation. Numerical simulations using COMSOL Multiphysics, a commercial finite-element based solver, were used to study the fluid-structure interaction, and determine whether the stent performs more properly as the amount of stent side holes increases. The results showed that the stent model with a 10 mm distance between side hole pairs provided the highest outlet flow rate, which indicates a proper stent design that allows for maximized urine discharge. We hope this study can help improve the stent design in kidney transplant procedures to further ease the inconvenience on the patients.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/FEDSM/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/FEDSM2021-64044/6780161/v001t02a037-fedsm2021-64044.pdf",""

Supervised machine learning (ML) approaches present one such method for analyzing new and previously published transcriptome data to identify novel genes and mechanisms. Our objective was to apply ML models to lung and immunological tissue datasets acquired from previous clinical BRD experiments to identify genes that classify disease with high accuracy. Raw mRNA sequencing reads from 151 bovine datasets (n=123 BRD, n=28 control) were downloaded from NCBI-GEO. Quality filtered reads were assembled in a HISAT2/Stringtie2 pipeline. Raw gene counts for ML analysis were normalized, transformed, and analyzed with MLSeq, utilizing six ML models. Cross-validation parameters (5-fold, repeated 10 times) were applied in a 70:30 training/testing ratio. Downstream analysis of genes identified by the top sparse classifiers for each etiological association was performed within WebGestalt and Reactome (FDR","https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-789747/v1",""

Test solutions with different surfactant concentrations (Cd = 75, 87.5, and 100 mM) at a fixed molar ratio of salt to surfactant (R = 0.32) were characterized by shear and extensional rheometry. While the lower concentrated test solution (Cd = 75 mM) with low τ0 (≈ 0.02 Pa) and no shear banding showed a Newtonian-like flow behavior for Mach number, Ma &lt; 1, the flow with corner vortices was formed when Ma exceeds unity. For higher Cd (87.5 and 100 mM), new fluidic phenomena are documented: (i) even at a low volumetric flow rate (Q), the fluid velocity at upstream corners was slower than that of Newtonian-like flows and (ii) at higher Q, the secondary flow with a quasi-static condition was formed at Ma well lower than unity. Micro-particle image velocimetry showed the lower shear rates at upstream corners, which can be understood by the effects of contraction entry, shear thinning, and high yield stress. The quasi-static secondary flow region was not induced by generation of elastic shock waves; instead the shear banding was found to be the underlying mechanism for the separation of the region from the main flow. In addition, the length of secondary flow regions showed a close correlation with the Deborah number, which was calculated using the extensional relaxation time.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/5.0063084/13874664/093112_1_online.pdf",""

In this study, we examine the association between lobbying and hospital performance and find that the effects of lobbying activities on hospital performance vary according to the distinct types of hospital ownership. Specifically, we find that lobbying raises employee salaries in not-for-profit (NFP) hospitals, reduces uncompensated care costs in both for-profit and NFP hospitals, and increases return on assets (ROA) in for-profit hospitals. We also find that the effects of lobbying on employee salaries, uncompensated care costs, and ROA are not significant in government hospitals. Taken together, our findings suggest that NFP hospitals lobby to protect employees' interests, while for-profit hospitals lobby to maximize investors' interests. Our paper provides evidence to illustrate that the goals and effects of hospital lobbying vary according to hospital ownership types.","https://publications.aaahq.org/jogna/article-pdf/10/1/1/1405/i2155-3815-10-1-1.pdf",""

Two thickness values of 50 and 100 nm are investigated with lateral dimensions ranging from 74 to 720 nm, thereby spanning the nanowire to nanoribbon scales. Average polycrystalline grain sizes were 27 ± 5 nm for thickness 50 nm and 35 ± 4 nm for 100 nm thickness. Systematic decrease in κ is observed as film thickness is reduced and, for given thickness, as width decreases. At large lateral width studied here, corresponding to the microscale, κ values at room temperature are 280 and 200 W/m K for thicknesses of 100 and 50 nm, respectively. These are to be compared with the accepted value of κ = 317 W/m K for bulk gold. For the smallest case investigated, 50 nm in thickness and 74 nm in width, a value of κ = 56 W/m K is obtained. A small decrease is observed for κ when measured with ambient temperature 100 °C. The systematic dependence on width, for each thickness and both ambient temperatures studied, followed a simple exponential dependence with a characteristic length parameter of ∼150 nm. This length parameter exceeds the accepted electron mean-free path (∼40 nm), the grain sizes, and the film thicknesses. The decrease in κ with diminishing size was examined based on the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) methods. Agreement and limitations of the BTE are discussed.","https://aip.scitation.org/doi/am-pdf/10.1063/5.0054546",""

Inactivation of Ku complex genes YKU70 or YKU80 in cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae gives rise to mutants that exhibit shortened telomeres and temperature-sensitive growth. In this study, we have investigated the mechanism by which overexpression of telomerase suppresses the temperature sensitivity of yku mutants. Viability of yku cells was restored by overexpression of the Est2 reverse transcriptase and TLC1 RNA template subunits of telomerase, but not the Est1 or Est3 proteins. Overexpression of other telomerase- and telomere-associated proteins (Cdc13, Stn1, Ten1, Rif1, Rif2, Sir3, and Sir4) did not suppress the growth defects of yku70 cells. Mechanistic features of suppression were assessed using several TLC1 RNA deletion derivatives and Est2 enzyme mutants. Supraphysiological levels of three catalytically inactive reverse transcriptase mutants (Est2-D530A, Est2-D670A, and Est2-D671A) suppressed the loss of viability as efficiently as the wild-type Est2 protein, without inducing cell senescence. Roles of proteins regulating telomere length were also determined. The results support a model in which chromosomes in yku mutants are stabilized via a replication-independent mechanism involving structural reinforcement of protective telomere cap structures.","https://academic.oup.com/g3journal/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/g3journal/jkab359/41295432/jkab359.pdf",""

Non-lactating, pregnant beef cows (n = 190) were ranked by parity, pregnancy type, body weight (BW) and body condition score (BCS), at 117 ± 2.2 d of gestation (d 0) and assigned to receive a supplement containing: 1) sulfate sources of Cu, Co, Mn, and Zn (INR; n = 95) or 2) an organic complexed source of Cu, Mn, Co, and Zn (AAC; Availa®4; Zinpro Corporation, Eden Prairie, MN; n = 95). From d 0 to calving, cows were maintained in a single pasture and individually offered treatments three times a week. Calves were weaned at 6 mo of age (d 367) and preconditioned for 45-d. Heifer puberty status was verified weekly (d 437 to d 619) based on plasma progesterone concentrations. Steer calves were shipped to a commercial feedlot on d 493, where they were managed as a single group until slaughter (d 724). Plasma cortisol concentration was greater (P = 0.05) in AAC calves at weaning but tended to be less (P = 0.10) on d 370 compared with INR calves. Mean plasma haptoglobin concentration was greater (P = 0.03) in INR vs. AAC calves during preconditioning, and no treatment effects were noted (P = 0.76) for preconditioning average daily gain (ADG).

Although the FMS™ has been a popular topic of research in recent years, normative data and asymmetries in college-aged students have not been established through research. Purpose: The objective was to determine normative FMS™ scores, report frequency counts for FMS™ asymmetries, and determine if the number of sports seasons and number of different sports an individual participated in during high school varied between university students that showed FMS™ identified asymmetries. Study Design: Cross-sectional Study Methods: One hundred university students completed the FMS™ and an associated survey to determine which sport(s) and for how many seasons they participated in each sport(s) during high school. Total FMS™ scores were assessed as well as identifying the presence of an asymmetry during a FMS™ screen. An asymmetry within the FMS™ was defined as achieving an unequal score on any of the screens that assessed right versus left movements of the body. Data Analysis: Data analysis included descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation was utilized to investigate the relationship between number of sports played and number of sport seasons. Shapiro Wilk test for normality, and Mann Whitney U test was employed to investigate group differences in number of sports played. All analyses were conducted using SPSS software. Results: Statistically significant correlations (r = .286, r Conclusion: Participating in multiple sports and multiple sport seasons during high school was associated with higher FMS™ total scores.

The factorial was made up of manure treatment (0, 0.25, 0.5, or 1% BW DDGS, chemical fertilizer, or none) soil type (Windthorst or Purves), and plant species (none, crimson clover, or rye). Pots were sown (5 seeds/pot) and grown in a greenhouse for 35 d. Water was applied daily at 90% evapotranspiration.

Training datasets are collected first to train a GRNN model. The model is then deployed to predict the rotation angle.

Selective Laser Melting (SLM) method generally melts pure elemental powders or prefabricated alloy powders without alloying process. In-situ alloying in SLM, which is also called Laser Additive Alloying (LAA), using pure elemental powders becomes a promising method for creating HEA with heterogeneous structures. However, the effect of the diffusion of elements in the molten pool on the formation of HEA remains unclear. In this paper, the well-discussed Cantor HEA was studied in an in-situ alloying situation, where pure elemental powders (Co, Cr, Mn, Ni, Fe) distributed on a powder bed were irradiated by laser and were subsequently allowed to cool back to room temperature. The diffusion of specific elements, with respect to their original clusters, was tracked via Mean Square Displacement (MSD) as well as the final composition of key locations. Our model was verified by showing a good agreement with the overall average diffusion rates of each element in the Cantor HEA qualitatively in other works from literature. Results initially showed that as the energy density increases, better diffusion was observed through a pixel overlay analysis about the mixing of different elements. The best-case scenario of diffusion from the pixel overlay map indicated a strong presence of 3 to 4 elements after the laser scanning. Given the conditions in the MD simulation, there was no apparent segregation of elements during the alloying process. In addition, we also conducted a simulation by implementing a 0.03 nm/ps laser scanning in a meander 2-track scan in order to completely melt the powder bed. After cooling and equilibration, Polyhedral Template Analysis was applied to analyze the crystal structure of the solidified powder bed in the presence of increasing components. When the powders of Cantor HEA were alloyed using LAA approach, all elements experienced a complex diffusion behavior, elements like Cr also experienced a relatively rapid diffusion compared to other elements. Despite this, Cr only diffused for a short period and diffused minimally during the in-situ alloying process. The analysis of element-specific behavior, such as diffusion, can provide a framework for the LAA production of HEA. This MD study provides a detailed analysis about the effect of diffusion on the formation of HEA system if in-situ alloying is adopted, the findings of this study can be used to guide the material design and the appropriate parameters for manufacturing process of new HEAs. This study can also be extended to analyze the effect of diffusion on the thermomechanical properties of HEAs.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2021-72075/6826759/v02at02a070-imece2021-72075.pdf",""

In this study, we conduct in‐depth interviews to examine the role accounting plays in the development of the US cannabis industry (CI) as it transitions from the illicit market in which formal accounting was systematically avoided to a state‐legal market in which participants are subject to conventional business processes. Facing impediments to traditional operating practices and pressures to increase normative conformity for industry survival, cannabis operators (COs) incorporated the use of accounting in three normalizing strategies (creative concession, collaborative facilitation, and experimentation), seemingly influenced by the incongruencies between prior illicit‐market culture and experiences and the state‐legal operating environment. In response to what operators perceived to be coercive regulation, they employed creative concession strategies, including influencing, bargaining, challenging, escaping, and cessation tactics. However, in response to pressures to adopt more commonly accepted forms of accounting, COs instead deployed two different strategies, one focused on acquiescence to normalizing pressures when doing so facilitated essential relationship building (i.e., collaborative facilitation strategies), and one deployed as strategic experimentation, working to normalize industry activities in areas of perceived threats to industry acceptance and continuity. Given CO accounting naiveté, its usefulness was often introduced by peripheral industry parties attempting to normalize their own participation with the CI. Notably, we also find that normalizing pressures occasionally resulted in unintended consequences, including reversion to the illicit market and forgoing normalizing strategies in favor of retaining some level of dirtiness to fend off pending competition, both of which threaten to reemphasize the industry's dirtiness. Our study, therefore, points to accounting itself as a central mechanism in the complex, multidirectional strategy to normalize transitional dirtiness.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1911-3846.12733",""

A type of degradation of the organic transport layer is examined, which is reversible by applying a forward bias soak, and how the degradation arises from ion migration mechanisms is explained. Experimental current–voltage and capacitance transient measurements are conducted as a function of temperature. The resulting S‐kink and positive capacitance decay are explained in terms of the modeled effects of a changing ion density at the hole transport layer. An irreversible degradation is found upon heating to more than 100 °C. On the contrary, the inorganic hole transport layer is found to eliminate the observable effects of ion migration, even at elevated temperatures, so long as air exposure is avoided.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/pssa.202000721",""

In summary, among heifers circulating PAG concentrations increased with gestational age, but gestational age only accounted for 25% of the variation. Among cows, gestational age (d 30–190) accounted for 64% of variation in PAG concentrations, thus a modified blood pregnancy test may allow for determining gestational age.","http://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/99/Supplement_1/207/37889845/skab054.339.pdf",""

Using video-cued ethnography and data from the Blinded Study, the authors center three- and four-year-old children who engaged in a collaborative, dynamic make-believe game involving a struggle between family members and los policías (“the police”). Using traditional qualitative methods, the authors first identify and name all the different ways in which the children enacted their agency and demonstrated capabilities in their play, particularly the cultural capabilities that challenge deficit discourses about Latinx immigrant communities. They contextualize the children’s play using teacher interview data in which the teachers explained their thinking behind the pedagogical decisions that made this type of learning and play possible. Finally, the authors explore how the teachers’ identities and histories positioned them to engage with their students in culturally sustaining ways. It is argued that with the growing global awakening to white supremacy structures and violence, there is urgency in creating time and space to support young children’s agency and their right to practice the skills they need to contribute to their communities’ well-being and survival now and in the future.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/14639491211021595",""

Exosomes, microvesicles secreted by cells, have been shown to play a role in drug resistance, but a comprehensive protein signature relating to osteosarcoma carboplatin resistance has not been fully characterized. MethodsIn this study, cell lysates and exosomes from two derivatives (HMPOS-2.5R and HMPOS-10R) of the HMPOS osteosarcoma cell line generated by repeated carboplatin treatment and recovery, were characterized proteomically by mass spectrometry. Protein cargos of circulating serum exosomes from dogs with naturally occurring osteosarcoma, were also assessed by mass spectrometry, to identify biomarkers that discriminate between good and poor responders to carboplatin therapy. ResultsBoth cell lysates and exosomes exhibited distinct protein signatures related to drug resistance. Furthermore, exosomes from the resistant HMPOS-2.5R cell line were found to transfer drug resistance to drug-sensitive HMPOS cells. The comparison of serum exosomes from dogs with a favorable disease-free interval [DFI] of >300 days, and dogs with <100 days DFI revealed a proteomic signature that could discriminate between the two cohorts with high accuracy. Furthermore, when the patient’s exosomes were compared to exosomes isolated from carboplatin resistant cell lines, several putative biomarkers were found to be shared. Conclusions﻿The findings of this study highlight the significance of exosomes in the potential transfer of drug resistance, and the discovery of novel biomarkers for the development of liquid biopsies to better guide personalized chemotherapy treatment.","https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-240444/v1",""

The effects of LY and TEMP were investigated using a 2 x 2 crossover design that spanned five periods. Eight Angus crossbred steers (365 ± 32 kg) were randomly split into pairs and housed in four outdoor pens outfitted with an individualized feeding system. Animals were limit fed a grower diet (DIET) at 1.2% SBW with no live yeast supplementation (NOY) or a grower diet top-dressed with 10 g live yeast/d for 14 days (1.2 × 1012 CFU/d). On days 13 and 14, animals were subjected to one of two TEMP conditions, thermoneutral (TN; 18.4 ± 1.1°C, 57.6 ± 2.8 % RH) or heat stress (HS; 33.8 ± 0.6°C, 55.7 ± 2.7 % RH), in two side-by-side, single-stall open-circuit, indirect respiration calorimetry chambers. Data were analyzed using a random coefficients model. Carryover effects were examined and removed from the model if not significant (P &gt; 0.05). There was no effect of DIET, TEMP, or DIET×TEMP (P &gt; 0.05) on ruminal pH, redox, ciliated protozoa count, acetate, butyrate, total VFA, and ruminal ammonia concentrations. Similarly, the acetate to propionate ratio was not influenced by DIET, TEMP, or DIET × TEMP (P ≥ 0.190). Propionate concentration was the greatest in animals in TN conditions receiving LY (P = 0.008). Compared to HS+NOY, HS+LY (P = 0.003) and TN+LY (P = 0.043) had greater ruminal enumerations of Fusobacterium necrophorum. This suggests LY (P = 0.010) provided a favorable environment for F. necrophorum during heat stress. Live yeast supplementation did not improve overall ruminal fermentation during heat stress. Additional research is required to better understand the dynamic relationship between live yeast and temperature exposure.","http://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/99/Supplement_3/459/40567904/skab235.814.pdf",""

However, the current TPIs exhibit many serious side effects that may pose limitations in chemotherapy. Combretastatin A-4 (CA-4) is a natural TPI that binds at the colchicine binding site located on microtubules. The only cis isomer of CA-4 is bio-active; however, due to its short half-life, it isomerizes quickly to its bio-inactive trans geometric isomer. For preventing shortcomings of CA-4, azobenzene based CA-4, called azo-CA-4 (azo-CA-4) is identified as a novel TPI. The geometric isomerization of azo- CA-4 can be controlled upon exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light to remotely control its bioactivity. Cis-azo-CA-4 is 200-500 times more active (IC50 = 0.2-10 μM) than trans-azo-CA-4 (IC50 = 50-110 μM) against various cancer cell lines. Photo-pharmacology uses light to control drug activity, introducing a unique mechanism to develop novel photo-responsive TPIs. Further, the green chemistry approach using ethanol and water as a green solvent in the synthesis of azo-CA-4 delivers advanced methodology in novel TPI development.","https://eurekaselect.com/article/download/193614",""

Background: Educational institutions operating in the higher education marketplace are facing increased competition for students. In order to be competitive in terms of the student services provided, these institutions need a method to evaluate and measure, on a frequent and recurring basis, the quality and performance of their services. Methodology: A survey was developed and administered to a stratified random sample of 1,400 students at a large public university in the southwestern United States. The 56% response rate was comprised of 790 total respondents. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyze model constructs and latent variables. Reliability, validity, non-response bias, and common method bias were assessed as part of the research. Contribution: The HESQI is a compact, parsimonious instrument that can be administered in a cost-effective manner for faster, point-in-time checks of student satisfaction with less survey fatigue than larger instruments. Findings Service quality is significantly correlated with student satisfaction. The developed model is capable of explaining nearly 70% of the variance in student perceptions of satisfaction. Recommendations for Practitioners: The developed HESQI instrument addresses the need for a quick and easy measurement instrument to assess student satisfaction in higher education institutions. The HESQI instrument simplifies data collection and analysis and can be used on a frequent and ongoing basis to gain rapid insight into service and quality issues affecting students. Recommendations for Researchers: The development of the HESQI provides an instrument that researchers can use to study the delivery of auxiliary services in higher education. In addition, the methodology used has implications for how to develop and test other parsimonious instrument for use in other contexts. Impact on Society: Higher education is of critical value to societal mobility. As such providing a better experience for those who seek education is important and services are an important part of that experience. The HESQI has an important role in helping to improve that experience because it allows measuring the satisfaction with changes that are made to improve auxiliary services which are important to the overall environment and experience. Future Research: Future research may be carried out to further validate and confirm the research findings and use it in other environments. Also, research may consider a single item instrument in similar environments.","",""

Adequacy was assessed through precision and accuracy using three standard mixtures of known acetate, propionate, and butyrate concentrations. The standard mixtures were prepared for VFA analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or gas chromatography (GC). Each mixture was injected ten times into each EM. The comparison was assessed with rumen fluid samples from four cannulated steers offered three diets at 2% BW. Diet A simulated a forage-based diet offered to cattle during the winter. Diet B simulated a grower-type diet offered to weaned calves. Diet C simulated a finisher-type diet offered to finishing cattle. Rumen fluid was collected three hours after the morning feeding for seven days for each diet and strained through 8 μm porosity fiberglass wool. Two 2-mL aliquots were stored at -20°C for HPLC analysis, while two 8-mL aliquots were diluted with 2 mL of 25% meta-phosphoric acid and stored at -20°C for GC analysis. Chromatograms without a flat baseline were removed from the analysis. For the adequacy evaluation, HPLC (R2 = 0.997; Cb = 0.874) was more precise and accurate at estimating total VFA than GC (R2 = 0.447; Cb = 0.763). When compared with the standards, HPLC estimated less (P &lt; 0.001) total VFA (98.8 ± 10.3 mM) than GC (110.5 ± 17.4 mM).

Acidosis occurrence has been directly correlated to the ratio of concentrate to forage in the diet. However, the rates of substrate fermentation and acid absorption vary at different locations in the rumen. The objective of this study was to determine the pH in different locations of the rumen using 16 rumenally- cannulated steers (309 ± 43 kg) receiving quebracho extract (QT; Schinopsis balansae) within a grower-type diet [25:75 forage-to-concentrate, dry matter (DM) % basis]. Animals were randomly assigned to one of four dietary treatments (n = 4): QT at 0, 1, 2, and 3% of DM (QT0, QT1, QT2, and QT3). Animals were adapted to the basal diet (QT0) for 12-d before being introduced to predetermined treatments for four weeks, with feed provided twice daily to allow ad libitum intake. Weekly measurements of ruminal fluid pH and redox potential (Eh) were taken four h post-feeding using a portable pH and redox meter probe in four locations of the rumen (cranial sac, ventral sac, dorsal sac, and reticulum). Data were analyzed using a random coefficients model with the pen as a random effect and week as repeated measures. The DM intake was included as a covariate. There was no interaction among diet, location, and week (P ≥ 0.925) on pH. Overall, ruminal pH was lower for QT0 and QT1 compared to QT3 (P &lt; 0.001). Ruminal pH in the cranial sac and reticulum was greater than in the dorsal sac (5.98, 6.03, and 5.87, respectively; P = 0.001). Redox potential was lower for QT0 in week 1 than all other treatments (P = 0.042).

Behavioral syndromes may be evolutionarily constrained, preventing behaviors from evolving independently, or they may be an adaptive result of selection on the correlation itself. We tested these hypotheses by characterizing the behavioral syndromes in two sympatric, closely related species and testing for differences between the species. We studied the unisexual Amazon molly (Poecilia formosa) and one of its bisexual, parent species, the sailfin molly (P. latipinna). Sympatric female sailfin and Amazon mollies compete for mating which could affect the behavioral syndromes found in each species. We identified a behavioral syndrome between exploration and activity in both species that did not differ between species. Additionally, we explored the relationship between a stress response hormone, cortisol, and behavioral type, and did not detect a relationship. However, P. formosa differed from P. latipinna in their cortisol release rates. Behavioral syndromes may be constrained in this complex, aiding in mate acquisition for P. formosa by virtue of having a similar behavioral type to P. latipinna. The difference between the females in cortisol release rates may be a useful mate identification cue for males to offset higher mating mistakes associated with the similar behavioral types.","https://www.mdpi.com/2079-7737/10/3/186/pdf",""

The constituent materials are: a two-part elastomer, iron oxide microparticles, and a rapid cure epoxy. Combining the elastomer with the iron oxide particles results in an MAE actuator, such that application of an external magnetic field induces dipoles in the iron oxide particles, resulting in the actuation of the MAE. The shape memory epoxy polymers are deformed at an elevated temperature and cooled to lock-in the temporary programmed shape. Subsequent exposure to elevated temperature can then recover a permanent geometry. In a first step, the layered unimorph structure is fabricated using casting techniques in which the SMP serves as the ‘passive’ substrate, and the MAE is cast on top of this substrate or joined post-processing using adhesives. To demonstrate shape change, the unimorph is heated beyond the transition temperature of the epoxy, and a magnetic field is applied to deform the structure. Upon cooling, the shape change is locked into place. This configuration serves as proof-of-concept that the proposed magnetically-responsive polymers are capable of eliciting the shape change of an SMP through bending in response to an external magnetic stimulus. After demonstrating feasibility, the next step is to use additive manufacturing (AM) to produce both the SMP and MAE by developing and tuning MAE and SMP resin formulations for printability. Printability is assessed by characterizing the viscosities, effective yield stress, gelation times, and extent of cure of the material formulations. The bending response of the layered structure is characterized as a function of magnetic field, material composition, geometric parameters, and AM process settings.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/SMASIS/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/SMASIS2021-68238/6776517/v001t01a012-smasis2021-68238.pdf",""

We chose the pulmonary valve (PV) to study, due to its importance in congenital heart valve disease. Excised pulmonary outflow tracts from eleven 1-year old C57BL/6J mice were fixed at 10, 20, and 30 mmHg to simulate physiological loading. Micro-computed tomography was used to reconstruct the 3D organ-level PV geometry, which was then spatially correlated with serial en-face scanning electron microscopy imaging to quantify local collagen fiber distributions. From the acquired volume renderings, we obtained the geometric descriptors of the murine PV under increasing transvalvular pressures, which demonstrated remarkable consistency. We also observed that the preferred collagen orientation was predominantly in the circumferential direction, as in larger mammalian valves.

Three access to healthcare variables proved statistically significant: lack of a primary care provider (Odds Ratio, OR = 0.853, p < 0.001), cost considerations prevented some care (OR = 1.232, p < 0.001), and lack of an annual checkup (OR = 0.807, p < 0.001). The directionality of these odds ratios is congruent with a marginal effects model and implies that those without MI are more likely not to have a primary provider or annual checkup, but those with MI are more likely to have missed care due to the cost of that care. Cost of healthcare for MI patients is associated with not receiving care after accounting for all other variables.","https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/21/11284/pdf",""

Some philosophers nevertheless suggest this sensory phenomenal character does not exhaust the way things are made manifest to us in perceptual experience. Edmund Husserl maintains that there is also a significant non‐sensory side to perception's phenomenal character. We may experience, for instance, an object's facing surface in a sensory mode and, as part of the same perceptual experience, also that object's out‐of‐view surface in a non‐sensory mode. To the extent that perceptual experience makes things available to us in a non‐sensory mode, Husserl calls it inadequate. Here, I reconstruct four arguments for the conclusion that perceptual experience is inadequately found in various of Husserl's writings and critically evaluated them. My aim is both to showcase the variety and sophistication of Husserl's reasons for thinking perceptual experience is inadequate and to problematize that idea.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ejop.12705",""

While scholars' methods and ethical conventions have historically privileged the agency of research participants, the current landscape suggests the value of exploring methods that would reveal actions that are purposefully hidden. We propose investigation as a model for critical information studies and review the methods and epistemological conventions of investigative journalists as a provocative example, noting that their orientation toward those in power enables them to discuss societal harms in ways that academic researchers often cannot. We conclude by discussing key topics, such as process accountability and institutional norms, that should feature in discussions of how academic researchers might position investigation in relation to their own work.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/asi.24446",""

This paper proposes a heuristic method to optimize the order picking distance based on frequent itemset grouping and nonuniform product weights. The proposed heuristic uses association rule mining (ARM) to create families of products based on the similarities between the stock keeping units (SKUs). SKUs with higher similarities are located near the rest of the members of the family. This heuristic is applied to a numerical case using data obtained from a real distribution center in the food retail industry.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between SCR, sperm motility, SERPINA5 concentrations, and in vitro embryo development. Measurements were performed in 19 bulls with SCR values ranging from -7.7 to 4.45. For each bull, an aliquot of frozen-thawed semen was used for analyses of total (TMOT) and progressive (PROG) motility. Remaining semen was fixed with 2% formaldehyde, and concentration of SERPINA5 was determined by immunolocalization (antibody SERPINA5/Dylight405; PA5-79976-Invitrogen / ab201798-Abcam). Mean fluorescence intensity was determined in ~200 sperm heads/bull. Approximately 149 oocytes/bull were fertilized in vitro for embryo development analysis (cleavage and blastocyst rates). Statistical procedures were performed in SAS (9.4) using the procedures CORR for correlations (SCR, TMOT, PROG, SERPINA5, cleavage and blastocyst) and GLIMMIX for comparison of “field-fertility” (SCR divided in HIGH or LOW) and “field-embryo-fertility” (LOW-SCR sires were divided based on blastocyst rate (HIGH or LOW) resulting in two classifications; LOW-HIGH≥31% and LOW-LOW≤26%, respectively). There were positive correlations (P &lt; 0.05) between cleavage-blastocyst (r=0.50), SERPINA5-cleavage (r=0.48), and TMOT-PROG (r=0.76). Sire SCR was not associated with SERPINA5, TMOT, PROG, cleavage and blastocyst rate (P &gt; 0.52). Among LOW-SCR sires, LOW-LOW sires (-4.83±0.60) tended to have a better SCR score than LOW-HIGH (-6.18±0.42) sires (P = 0.08), but there were no differences (P &gt; 0.43) between LOW-HIGH, LOW-LOW, and HIGH sires for SERPINA5, TMOT, PROG, and cleavage. In conclusion, some LOW SCR sires have good embryo development indicating a different mechanism for their low SCR; however, these differences in SCR could not be explained by TMOT, PROG, SERPINA5, cleavage and blastocyst. There were, however, positive correlations between cleavage-blastocyst rate, and SERPINA5-cleavage rate.","http://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/99/Supplement_3/310/40567785/skab235.569.pdf",""

Previous studies have shown that women, night shift workers, and individuals with comorbid psychological conditions are more likely to report nightmares. Yet no studies have comprehensively examined demographic and psychosocial factors of nightmares among nurses. Methods: To address this gap, we examined demographic (age, gender, race, ethnicity, number of children, marital status, shift work status) and psychosocial (chronotype, PTSD, anxiety, depression, perceived stress) correlates of nightmares in a sample of 462 nurses (91% female; mean age = 39.03, SD = 11.07; 78% White; 10% Hispanic/Latinx). Nightmares were determined two ways: 1) using a newly validated retrospective survey measure, the Nightmare Disorder Index (NDI), and 2) using aggregated prospective reports of daily nightmare frequency across 2 weeks (nurses who reported any nightmares in the past 2 weeks were classified as having nightmares). Results: Nurses experiencing nightmares as determined by the NDI (n = 236; 51%) were younger, more likely to be female, less likely to have children, more likely to be an intermediate chronotype, less likely to be a morning chronotype, and had higher mean levels of PTSD, anxiety, depression, and perceived stress than nurses without nightmares. Nurses experiencing nightmares as determined by daily surveys (n = 191; 41%) were not different in terms of any demographic characteristics, but had higher levels of PTSD, anxiety, depression, and perceived stress than those nurses without nightmares. Conclusion: Demographic and psychosocial differences in nightmare prevalence may differ based on how nightmares are assessed (i.e., retrospective vs. prospective measures). Overall, nurses with higher stress, PTSD, depression, and anxiety may be at greatest risk of having nightmares. Future studies should examine if targeting these factors results in improvements in sleep and well-being among nurses.

This indicates the α and PPII conformations are dominant components of the ensembles of denatured structures that exist in solution for biological proteins, an observation supported in part by structural studies of short, and thus unfolded, peptides. Although intrinsic conformational propensities have been determined experimentally for the common amino acids in short peptides, and estimated from surveys of the protein coil library, the ability of these intrinsic conformational propensities to quantitatively reproduce structural behavior in intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), an increasingly important class of proteins in cell function, has thus far proven elusive to establish. Recently, we demonstrated that the sequence dependence of the mean hydrodynamic size of IDPs in water and the impact of heat on the coil dimensions, provide access to both the sequence dependence and thermodynamic energies that are associated with biases for the α and PPII backbone conformations. Here, we compare results from peptide-based studies of intrinsic conformational propensities and surveys of the protein coil library to those of the sequence-based analysis of heat effects on IDP hydrodynamic size, showing that a common structural and thermodynamic description of the protein denatured state is obtained.","https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/3/634/pdf",""

Tumor cells preferentially using nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), the rate-limiting enzyme in the salvage pathway for synthesis of NAD, a critical cofactor for diverse biological processes including cellular redox reactions, energy metabolism, and biosynthesis. NAMPT is overexpressed in most malignancies, including gliomas, and can serve as a tumor-specific target. Methods: Effects of pharmacological inhibition of NAMPT on cellular oxygen consumption rate, extracellular acidification, mitochondrial respiration, cell proliferation, invasion, and survival were assessed through in vitro and ex vivo studies on genetically heterogeneous glioma cell lines, glioma stem-like cells (GSCs), and mouse and human ex vivo organotypic glioma slice culture models. Results: Pharmacological inhibition of the NAD salvage biosynthesis pathway using a highly specific inhibitor, KPT-9274, resulted in the reduction of NAD levels and related downstream metabolites, inhibited proliferation, and induced apoptosis in vitro in cell lines and ex vivo in human glioma tissue. These effects were mediated by mitochondrial dysfunction, DNA damage, and increased oxidative stress leading to apoptosis in GSCs independent of genotype, IDH status, or MGMT promoter methylation status. Conversely, NAMPT inhibition had minimal in vitro effects on normal human astrocytes (NHA) and no apparent in vivo toxicity in non-tumor-bearing mice. Conclusions: Pharmacological NAMPT inhibition by KPT9274 potently targeted genetically heterogeneous gliomas by activating mitochondrial dysfunction. Our preclinical results provide a rationale for targeting the NAMPT-dependent alternative NAD biosynthesis pathway as a novel clinical strategy against gliomas.","http://academic.oup.com/neuro-oncology/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/neuonc/noab175/40075445/noab175.pdf",""

Purpose: The aim of this project was to discover if self-exposure to immersive virtual nature can lead to any change in nature connectedness. Methodology/Approach: Participants were recruited from the Texas State University campus and randomized into three experimental conditions: a filmed library or nature experience, and an in-nature experience. 360-degree videos of a nature preserve and the university library were projected within a head-mounted display in a laboratory setting. Results of pre- and postsurvey data were compared between experimental groups. Findings/Conclusions: Pairwise comparisons with the Nature Relatedness Scale indicated that participants in the in-nature experience reported significantly stronger beliefs about their connection to nature than those in either virtual condition. With respect to the State of Independence with Nature Scale, planned pairwise comparisons indicated that between participants in the in-nature experience and the virtual nature experience did not differ. Implications: This study suggests that to connect with nature, one should spend time there. In addition, here data support that a virtual immersive nature experience can affect a state-dependent measurement of nature connection, and even equal that of an in-nature experience.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/10538259211001568",""

The Ge Γ conduction band valley state plays the largest single role, but L and X valley states collectively contribute a larger share than Γ due to the multiplicity of degenerate states. C sites structurally resemble uncharged vacancies in the Ge lattice, similar to Hjalmarson's model for other HMAs. C also perturbs the entire Ge band structure even at the deepest crystal core energy levels, particularly if staggered supercells are used to mimic a disordered alloy. Projection onto atomic sites shows a relatively weak localization compared with other HMAs, but it does show a strong anisotropy in probability distribution.

Therefore, the purpose of this qualitative study was to seek understanding of the experiences in managing T2D among Black men during the COVID-19 pandemic. One on one interviews were conducted via Zoom video conferencing with twenty-two (n=22) Black men regarding their experience of managing type 2 diabetes (T2D) in a pandemic environment. Four main themes emerged from the study, which are: (1) stress levels during the pandemic, (2) barriers to managing my diabetes, (3) who/what is helping the most, and (4) communication with health-care provider. As more information becomes available, it is apparent that having diabetes increases the risk for detrimental COVID-19 outcomes (i.e. increased lengths of hospital stays, the need for mechanical ventilation, and mortality.

Prior research finds that performance evaluations are based largely on the subordinate's work outcomes, such as task completion and budgeted hours, and also are related to employee satisfaction/dissatisfaction and an increase/decrease in overall job performance. Utilizing psychology theories, we investigate whether a manager's feedback tone (supportive/non‐supportive) and evaluation focus (tasks/goals) influence auditors’ self‐esteem as well as their corresponding professional skepticism, including their search for evidence. Based on an experiment with 118 experienced auditors, we find that supportive and goal‐focused performance evaluations, independently, lead to higher self‐esteem. This elevated self‐esteem translates into desirable auditor attributes, such as greater professional skepticism and an increase in search for evidence and audit quality.

While current regulations restrict audit committee members from holding management positions (i.e., affiliations), studies find that management's preferences continue to impact audit committee decisions. This motivates analysis of independence threats beyond affiliations. We apply the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' conceptual approach to independence and examine the threat of management's undue influence over audit committee members. Examining the relative tenure of executives and audit committee members, we find that greater management influence is associated with a lower propensity of the auditor to issue a modified going concern opinion to a distressed client. We also find that greater management influence is associated with increased opinion shopping behavior. These findings are consistent with an undue influence threat to audit committee independence. Our results extend the academic literature and inform regulatory concerns on audit committee independence.","https://publications.aaahq.org/ajpt/article-pdf/41/1/49/51380/i1558-7991-41-1-49.pdf",""

We add to this literature by investigating whether the advantages of highly educated family members matter for both Blacks and Whites in the U.S. Specifically, we ask whether the resources of family members-parents and offspring-partially explain the racial gap in both the prevalence and incidence of cognitive health across both groups. For this, we employ logistic regression models to examine the prevalence of cognitive impairment at baseline, and discrete-time event history models to assess the incidence of cognitive impairment, using data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) for the years ranging from 2000 to 2012. Preliminary results indicate that at the baseline, respondent’s own education is predictive of cognitive impairment among Whites, but not Blacks. Once respondent-level health conditions and behaviors are taken into consideration, parental or offspring education is not associated with the prevalence of cognitive impairment. For respondents who are not impaired at the baseline, our results from the incidence models align with the “adjacent generations” literature suggesting that both parental and offspring education has a salient positive effect on later-life cognitive health. However, we find notable differences across groups to suggest that the education of parents and offspring may play a larger role in mitigating cognitive decline among African Americans, compared to Whites.","https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/5/Supplement_1/520/43184478/igab046.2008.pdf",""

However, extant research offers few insights into the antecedents to student immigration attitudes. Survey data from undergraduate students taking business courses at two large public universities in the southeast U.S. reveal that while student attitudes toward immigration are more moderate than the general U.S. population, these attitudes differ by gender, political affiliation, and immigration background. Following realistic conflict theory and social identity theory, these student immigration attitudes are a function of both fear and competition. First, their attitudes are confounded by conflicting antecedents in perceived personal competition for resources with immigrants (e.g., jobs, wages) versus immigration benefits (e.g., costs, labor base, innovation). Second, xenophobia (fear of immigrants) is a remarkably powerful influencer of one’s immigration attitude and its antecedents. With these points, management educators must engage students in critical thinking about immigration to prepare them to effectively work with diverse colleagues and business partners while leading global organizations. We, therefore, present four cross-disciplinary areas of intersection between immigration and management education, including diversity and cultural intelligence, human resource management and ethics, entrepreneurship and innovation, and finally, economic and socioeconomic impacts.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/10525629211065623",""

Ovaries were collected from beef cows at specific stages of follicular development [pre-selection (PRE, n = 9), post-selection (POST, n = 9), and post-selection 24h after luteal regression (PG, n = 9)]. The largest follicle per stage was aspirated to obtain granulosa cells (GC) and follicular fluid (FF). Total cellular RNA was extracted from GC and RT-PCR was performed for GnRH-1, GnRH-2, GnRH-R and GAPDH. Radioimmunoassays were performed to determine FF concentrations of E2 and P4. Data were analyzed using the MIXED and REG procedures in SAS. There was no difference (P ≥ 0.23) in mRNA abundance of GnRH-2, GnRH-R or FF concentrations of P4 across follicular stages. There was an effect of stage on FF E2 (PRE: 17,925±20,273, POST: 28,458±21,503, and PG: 252,616±21,503 pg/mL; P &lt; 0.01).

Consequently, AW is one of the seven grand challenges (GCs) identified by the ASAS Public Policy Committee (PPC). Societal concerns can lead to public policy decisions at the state or federal level that impact animal agriculture. The ASAS PPC GCs on animal welfare will be examined, progress evaluated, and recommendations made for setting research priorities. Five key questions and their corresponding expected outcomes were identified to advance AW in the GC areas of sustainable management practices, genetic markers, pain mitigation, transportation, and humane euthanasia/depopulation. The diversity of disciplines required to address these key questions is astounding. A five-year window (2015-present) was used to evaluate each key question and outcome. The published peer-reviewed literature and the North Central 1029 and Western 3173 multi-state project station reports served as the foundation for our evaluation. In brief, research opportunities exist to identify new methods and technologies to improve livestock transportation, humane endpoints for emergency depopulation, and management practices enhancing the sustainability footprint of livestock; and there is an urgent need to identify effective preventative measures against heat stress. The investigation of effective methods for species-specific pain assessment and mitigation strategies should continue to be a priority and include the development of alternative practices that avoid pain. Research into genetic markers associated with various aspects of animal wellbeing is growing and offers ample opportunity to improve animal welfare. Animal welfare research also requires scientists to engage with stakeholders to maintain perspective. One example is demonstrated by members of NC 1029 who report engagement in over thirty advisory boards across the supply chain.

Each of these sleep problems can contribute to physical (e.g., inflammation, musculoskeletal pain, cardiovascular disease and heart rate variability, indigestion, and menstrual cycle irregularity) and mental (e.g., depression, anxiety, suicidality) health problems as well as daytime fatigue and sleepiness among nurses and may contribute to burnout and job change. Methods: Participants (N=458) were nurses recruited for a parent study, “Sleep and Vaccine Response in Nurses (SAV-RN)” (Taylor & Kelly: R01AI128359-01). Most identified as female (90.5%), White/Caucasian (77.2%), and non-Hispanic (88.6%) with an average age of 39.03 (SD = 11.07). Participants completed baseline measures online via Qualtrics survey. The Sleep Condition Indicator (SCI; Espie et al., 2014) was used to identify a probable diagnosis of insomnia (score of ≤16 = Insomnia; endorsement of each of the primary DSM-5 criteria on the measure). In addition, a checklist of current major health conditions (high blood pressure, sleep apnea, GI issues, HIV/AIDS, cancer, etc.) was also completed. A Chi square test of Independence was conducted using SPSS to determine if insomnia detected by the SCI was associated with reported health conditions. Results: At baseline, 25.4% of nurses had a probable insomnia diagnosis. Insomnia was associated with a greater likelihood of diagnosed sleep apnea, cancer (all types), high blood pressure, chronic pain, gastrointestinal problems, an autoimmune disease, and/or an endocrine problem at Month 11 of the study (all ps &lt;.05). Data cleaning is ongoing, but similar analyses will be presented examining shift work sleep disorder and insufficient sleep (i.e., average &lt; 6hrs per night) as individual and simultaneous predictors of physical and mental health at baseline and change from baseline to Month 11 (if available). Conclusion: These results help to identify associations between insomnia and health conditions in nurses and may contribute to future research that supports evidence-based intervention and prevention strategies for this population. While evidence-based interventions for sleep disturbances and insomnia exist (CBT-I), accessibility and feasibility of scaling such interventions to reach the nursing community at large remains challenging.","http://academic.oup.com/sleep/article-pdf/44/Supplement_2/A133/37656391/zsab072.332.pdf",""

Similarly, there were not significant differences for vocabulary and comprehension outcomes (ES = 0.14; p = .59) for students with or at risk for WLRD.

A large percentage of young adults also struggle with low self-esteem. Together, disturbed sleep and low self-esteem may deplete coping resources, heighten to reactivity to stress, and increase disease risk. Yet no studies to our knowledge have examined interactions between self-esteem and sleep on biomarkers of health among young adults. Methods: To address this gap, we investigated associations between sleep quality, self-esteem, and two inflammatory markers, C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), in a sample of 60 young adults (mean age 25.3 ± 4.0 years old, 53% female, 83% White). Participants completed a baseline survey to assess self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Questionnaire) and sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI] sleep quality item), followed by 14 days of self-reported sleep disturbances each morning (PROMISTM sleep disturbances short-form; averaged across the 14 days). A plasma blood draw was then collected to assess CRP and IL-6 approximately one week after the end of the daily portion. Results: Lower self-esteem (b = -0.04, 95%CI [-0.06,-0.01], p = 0.015) and lower sleep quality were each associated with higher CRP (b = -0.34, 95%CI [-0.62, -0.07], p = 0.015), but not IL-6. Greater daily sleep disturbances were marginally associated with higher CRP (b = 0.37, 95%CI [-0.06,-0.79], p = 0.088]. Interactions between self-esteem and either sleep quality or sleep disturbances did not predict CRP or IL-6. Conclusion: Our results suggest low self-esteem and poorer sleep are each associated with higher levels of inflammation but may not interact to exacerbate risk. It is possible low self-esteem and poor sleep each lead to negative emotions or engagement in risky behaviors (e.g., substance use, sedentary behavior) that impact levels of inflammatory markers. Overall, our results highlight the importance of assessing both sleep and personality traits in relation to biomarkers of health among young adults.

Background: Toddlerhood is a time in which children have developed consistent, characteristic strategies for coping with their negative emotions. Temperament plays an important role in the development of emotion regulation strategies. Overregulated emotions are understudied and characterized by children's flat or suppressed affect. Method: The present study examined mothers' reports of infant temperament assessed at 6 weeks of age and observations of hostile and emotionally disengaged family interactions in relation to observed toddlers' emotional overregulation gathered at 24 months of age. Families ( Results: Infants with temperaments low in net negative reactivity who experienced disengaged family interactions at 24 months showed the greatest overregulation. Conclusions: Taken together, the results suggest that the way toddlers respond to a disengaged family emotional environment may depend at least in part on temperament assessed at infancy. Findings support the suggestion that overregulation is a unique type of emotional dysregulation and that it should continue to be examined in relation to family subsystems. Implications: This work emphasizes the importance of clinicians examining emotional disengagement within multiple family subsystems and the importance of not overlooking overregulated toddlers compared with underregulated children.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/fare.12580",""

Within these educational spaces, faculty members are often relied upon to deliver educational content without having their Second Amendment speech rights chilled by the prospect of loaded firearms within a classroom. Given this tension, this study fills an important gap in the research and explains how faculty members view campus carry as it relates to their personal safety and professional work. This study employed a mixed methods design (survey and qualitative) to expound upon the attitudes toward campus carry of 226 faculty and staff members working in a large research-intensive university within the state of Texas. Results suggest strong gender differences between how faculty members view campus carry policies and their safety on campus, with women often reporting feeling less safe and less able to perform their job duties under the pressure and anxiety of campus carry policies. Ultimately, this study’s results imply that women faculty members may more less safe, more marginalized, and further victimized by campus carry laws than men faculty members, transgressing gender equity progress in the professoriate, as women have been traditionally underrepresented on college faculties.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/00131245211047207",""

Our study aims to identify relationships between change in depression and marital transitions, test whether social support moderates this association, and to examine variation by gender. The sample included 3,705 participants from the Health and Retirement Study, who reported being married or partnered in 2012. Changes in marital status were measured between 2012 and 2014 (remained married/partnered (reference), divorced/separated, and widowed). Depression was measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression short form (CESD-8). Three types of social support from family, friends, and children were assessed: social support, social strain, and social contact. Autoregressive multiple regression was used to examine the relationship between change in depression, marital transitions, social support, and gender. Widowhood and social strain were independently associated with an increase in CESD-8 scores between 2012 and 2014. Significant interactions between social support and social strain, and separation/divorce were identified, and the relationship between social support, depression, and divorce varied by gender. Change in depression was positively associated with social support for separated/divorced females, but not separated/divorced males. These results indicate that social support may modify the influence of divorce on changes in depression among recently divorced older females. These findings can help mental health service providers more effectively target older adults at the greatest risk of depression after experiencing a marital transition.","https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/5/Supplement_1/919/43188898/igab046.3332.pdf",""

Immersion freezing initiated by ice-nucleating particles (INPs) is the dominant pathway of primary ice crystal formation in mixed-phase clouds, where supercooled water droplets and ice crystals coexist, with important implications for the hydrological cycle and climate. However, derivation of INP number concentrations from an ambient aerosol population in cloud-resolving and climate models remains highly uncertain. We conducted an aerosol–ice formation closure pilot study using a field-observational approach to evaluate the predictive capability of immersion freezing INPs. The closure study relies on collocated measurements of the ambient size-resolved and single-particle composition and INP number concentrations. The acquired particle data serve as input in several immersion freezing parameterizations, which are employed in cloud-resolving and climate models, for prediction of INP number concentrations. We discuss in detail one closure case study in which a front passed through the measurement site, resulting in a change of ambient particle and INP populations. We achieved closure in some circumstances within uncertainties, but we emphasize the need for freezing parameterization of potentially missing INP types and evaluation of the choice of parameterization to be employed. Overall, this closure pilot study aims to assess the level of parameter details and measurement strategies needed to achieve aerosol–ice formation closure. The closure approach is designed to accurately guide immersion freezing schemes in models, and ultimately identify the leading causes for climate model bias in INP predictions.","https://journals.ametsoc.org/downloadpdf/journals/bams/102/10/BAMS-D-20-0151.1.xml",""

However, disparities in the identification of ASD have been consistently documented for racial/ethnic minority and immigrant populations. The majority of studies of immigrant populations have focused on the qualitative experience of ASD, however, greater knowledge about the predictors of the age of initial ASD diagnosis is needed. This study examined the child, maternal, and family‐level factors that predicted the age of initial ASD diagnosis in a diverse clinical sample through a retrospective medical record review. Medical records of clinical evaluations conducted between 2004 and 2014 were reviewed for children with ASD born to immigrant and non‐immigrant mothers. Regression analyses found that for both groups of children with ASD, using verbal language to communicate and having another diagnosis (attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder or another condition) predicted an older age of initial ASD diagnosis. For children with ASD born to immigrant mothers, residing in a multilingual household was associated with a younger age of diagnosis. These results highlight the complexities of an ASD diagnosis among diverse children and families, particularly among immigrant communities. Lay Summary: This research looked at predictors of when children received their first autism spectrum disorder diagnosis across children born to immigrant mothers and children born to U.S.‐born mothers. Living in a multilingual home was related to a younger age of diagnosis for children of immigrant mothers; being verbal and having another diagnosis was related to an older age of diagnosis for both groups of children.

Recent trends suggest increased risk of poor self-reported health, physical disability, cognitive impairment, and mortality among later born birth cohorts, yet we are unaware of work examining cohort trends in multimorbidity among aging US adults. Observations were drawn from the Health and Retirement Study (2000–2018) and included adults aged 51 and older across 7 birth cohorts (1923 and earlier, 1924–1930, 1931–1941, 1942–1947, 1948–1953, 1954–1959, and 1960–1965). Multimorbidity was measured as a count of 9 chronic conditions including heart disease, hypertension, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, lung disease, cancer (excluding skin cancer), depression, and cognitive impairment. General linear models adjusting for repeated measures and covariates including age, sex, race/ethnicity, and education were used to identify whether trends in multimorbidity varied across birth cohort. 31,923 adults contributed 153,940 total observations, grand mean age was 68.0 (SD=10.09), and mean multimorbidity was 2.19 (SD=1.49). In analyses adjusted for age and other covariates, adults born 1948–1953 reported .34 more chronic conditions (SE=.03, p&lt;.001), adults born 1954–1959 reported .42 more chronic conditions (SE=.03, p&lt;.001), and adults born 1960–1965 reported .55 more chronic conditions (SE=.03, p&lt;.001), than those born 1931–1941, respectively. Our preliminary results confirm increasing multimorbidity among later birth cohorts of older Americans and should help guide policy to manage impending health declines among older Americans.","https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/5/Supplement_1/255/43180691/igab046.987.pdf",""

Some studies estimate that 35% of nurses experience nightmares related to experiences at work. Nightmares may also exacerbate stress among nurses, although this has yet to be tested empirically. We examined daily bidirectional associations between stress severity and nightmare occurrence and severity, and whether posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms moderated those relationships. Methods: 392 nurses (mean age = 39.54 years; SD = 11.15; 92% female; 78% White) were recruited for a larger study on sleep and vaccine response. For 14 days, upon awakening, nurses completed daily sleep diaries to assess previous-day stress severity (0 = not at all, 4 = extremely), as well as nightmare occurrence (0 = no nightmare, 1 = nightmare occurred) and nightmare severity (0 = not at all, 3 = very). PTSD symptoms were assessed at baseline using the PTSD Checklist of DSM-5 (PCL-5). Multilevel models were used to examine bidirectional, within-person associations between daily stress and nightmares, and cross-level moderation by baseline PTSD symptoms. Results: Approximately 10.5% of nurses met criteria for PTSD based on PCL-5 scores. 47.2% of nurses reported at least one nightmare across the two weeks. Days with greater stress severity were associated with higher odds of experiencing a nightmare (OR = 1.22, p = 0.001), as well as greater nightmare severity that night (b = 0.09, p = 0.033). Nightmare occurrence (b = 0.15, p &lt; 0.001) was associated with greater next-day stress severity. PTSD symptoms did not moderate daily stress and nightmare associations. Conclusion: Nurses face intense occupational demands and frequent exposure to potentially traumatic events. Our results indicated nightmares and stress may occur in a bidirectional fashion among nurses. Results were similar regardless of nurses’ PTSD status. Future studies should explore whether targeting nightmares and stress may improve nurses’ health and well-being. Given the essential role that nurses play in maintaining patient health and safety, it is critical to understand the causes and consequences of their sleep-related disturbances.","http://academic.oup.com/sleep/article-pdf/44/Supplement_2/A285/37657722/zsab072.726.pdf",""

In this paper, we describe a multiyear effort at Dow Agrosciences (now Corteva) to manage its seed corn portfolio, which includes several hundred seeds and is valued at more than $1 billion. The effort had two mutually interacting parts: (1) developing a decision-analytic theory to estimate the production yield distributions for new seed varieties from discrete quantile judgments provided by plant biology experts and (2) developing an optimization protocol to determine Dow's annual production plan for the seed portfolio with the flexibility of backup production in South America, under production yield uncertainty. The first part, owned by the research and development (R&D) function, provides yield probability distributions as inputs to the optimization protocol of the second part, which the production function owns. The results of the optimization problem, which include information about the attractiveness of specific future varieties, are returned to R&D. Both parts incorporate contextual details specific to this industry. In this paper, we show the optimality of linear policies for both problems. Additionally, the linear policies have many attractive structural properties that continue to hold for the more complex instances of the problems. A major strength of the theory we developed is that it is implementable in a transparent fashion, providing managers with a user-friendly, real-time decision support tool.

Attackers add carefully-crafted perturbations to input, where the perturbations are almost imperceptible to humans, but can cause models to make wrong predictions. Techniques to protect models against adversarial input are called adversarial defense methods. Although many approaches have been proposed to study adversarial attacks and defenses in different scenarios, an intriguing and crucial challenge remains that how to really understand model vulnerability? Inspired by the saying that ""if you know yourself and your enemy, you need not fear the battles"", we may tackle the challenge above after interpreting machine learning models to open the black-boxes. The goal of model interpretation, or interpretable machine learning, is to extract human-understandable terms for the working mechanism of models. Recently, some approaches start incorporating interpretation into the exploration of adversarial attacks and defenses. Meanwhile, we also observe that many existing methods of adversarial attacks and defenses, although not explicitly claimed, can be understood from the perspective of interpretation. In this paper, we review recent work on adversarial attacks and defenses, particularly from the perspective of machine learning interpretation. We categorize interpretation into two types, feature-level interpretation, and model-level interpretation. For each type of interpretation, we elaborate on how it could be used for adversarial attacks and defenses. We then briefly illustrate additional correlations between interpretation and adversaries. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future directions for tackling adversary issues with interpretation.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3468507.3468519",""

This is about 30% of the estimated total cancer patients in American women and therefore a major threat to the society with an urgent need of advanced treatment regimens. Especially the subgroup of estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancers (ENBC), which are approximately one quarter to a third of all breast cancer, are lacking efficient treatment methods. Particularly dangerous is triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a subtype of ENBC with a high metastatic potential, since 90% of cancer-related deaths are due to metastasis. However, an effective drug for ENBC/TNCB treatment remains to be developed. The pro-apoptotic protein Bax was shown to be downregulated in most cancers. As a result, the balance between Bax and its antagonist Bcl-2 gets disturbed which leads to dysfunctional apoptotic signaling in favor of cancer cell survival. Upon activation, Bax is translocated from the cytosol to the mitochondria where it binds to the outer mitochondrial membrane. This leads to increased permeability of the mitochondrial membrane and a release of pro-apoptosis related molecules such as cytochrome C and others. Hence, drug discovery for Bax activation is a promising approach for developing novel cancer therapies. The small molecules GL0385 and GL0388 were identified from our progenitor molecules including small-molecule Bax activator (SMBA1), CYD-2-11, and CYD-4-61. The CYD compounds specifically target the Ser184 residue of Bax and have shown apoptosis-inducing effects both in vitro and in vivo. These lead Bax activators provided proof-of-concept studies while further optimization is needed to mitigate potential toxicity, leading to the discovery of advanced lead molecules GL0385 and GL0388. Treatment with either GL0385 or GL0388 resulted in significantly decreased cell proliferation in MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, BT549, MDA-MB-453, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-361 cells. Additionally, MDA-MB-231 cells treated with GL0385 or GL0388 showed reduced migration and invasion, compared to control cells. Western blot analysis confirmed increased protein levels of Bax, cleaved PARP, cleaved caspase 3, and cytochrome C. These results show that GL0385 and GL388 have a significant impact on cancer cell proliferation and cellular motility which are main attributes of metastasizing cells. Additionally, increased expression of apoptosis markers indicates that these compounds may be beneficial to regain the anti-apoptotic/pro-apoptotic balance in breast cancer cells. Therefore, GL0385 and GL0388 are promising new advanced lead compounds towards the development of effective therapies for breast cancers and other cancers. Further investigation is warranted to fully explore their anti-cancer potential and mechanisms of action.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/81/13_Supplement/1239/667168/Abstract-1239-Putative-Bax-activators-GL0385-and",""

Results suggest that grain sorghum hybrid combinations involving lines adapted to different target regions can produce superior hybrids.

ENBCs do not respond to selective ER modulators such as tamoxifen. Therefore, there is an urgent need for non-ER-based therapies for ENBC. Recently, STAT3 was found to play an important role in maintaining cancer stem cells in vitro and in mouse models of human cancers. In addition, during mammary carcinogenesis, STAT3 is highly activated in mammary epithelial cells involving in mammary epithelial cell transformation, tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. STAT3 has been traditionally considered as non-targetable or undruggable, and there is currently a lack of FDA-approved STAT3 inhibitors for clinical use. We recently developed a putative STAT3 inhibitor, HJC0152, and a series of HJC0152-based analogues as orally bioavailable STAT3 inhibitors. These small molecules have been evaluated and a number of them showed low micro-molar potency in inhibiting the proliferation of a panel of breast cancer cell lines.

JMX0804 inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation at the Tyr705 residue and induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. In vivo, mice treated with JMX0804 at a 10 mg/kg dose via i.p. showed reduced growth of xenograft tumors arisen from MDA-MB-231 cells, with minimal impact on general health and body weight. Our current research supports the notion that JMX0804 suppresses breast cancer growth by inhibiting breast cancer cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis via mediating STAT3 signaling. JMX0804 is currently undergoing further characterization for breast cancer metastasis and mechanisms of action as well as optimization to improve drug properties including potency and safety profile.

The interest toward the red planet exploration has considerably increased as result of the successful deployment of the Perseverance Rover and the continuous tests developed by SpaceX’s launch vehicle, Starship. While the Mars 2020 Mission is currently in progress, the first controlled flight on another planet have been proven in April 2021 with the Vertical Take-off and Landing of the Ingenuity rotorcraft in Mars. In addition, the rotorcraft Dragonfly is expected to achieve the same endeavor in Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, by 2036. Continuous efforts have been oriented to the development of new technologies and aircraft configurations to improve the current designs and performance. In this paper we summarize the different Mars drone design and configuration approaches carried out by several research groups in the last two decades.

Background: Fatigue is commonly reported in people with T2DM, a chronic condition that is highly prevalent worldwide. However, a holistic understanding of the consequences and factors related to fatigue in adults with T2DM is not well synthesised. Design: This integrative review used Whittemore and Knafl's methodology and was reported according to the Preferred Reporting for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and checklist. Methods: The theory of unpleasant symptoms (TOUS) was used as a conceptual model to guide the review. The PubMed, PsychINFO and CINAHL databases were searched to identify studies that recruited adults with T2DM, were peer‐reviewed, written in English and investigated fatigue as a primary or secondary outcome. Two investigators independently appraised the quality of the studies and extracted the data. Results: Twenty‐nine articles met the inclusion criteria: 23 observational studies, two randomised controlled trials, one quasi‐experimental study and three qualitative studies. All articles were of high quality. Physiological (e.g. T2DM duration, complications and inflammatory biomarkers), psychological (e.g. diabetes distress, depression and sleep quality) and situational factors (e.g. race/ethnicity, education and social support) were related to fatigue. Studies reported fatigue as a barrier to physical activity, healthy eating behaviours and the physical aspect of QOL. Conclusions: Multiple factors are related to fatigue in adults with T2DM. Gaps in the literature include the multiple dimensions of fatigue, the effectiveness of interventions to alleviate fatigue and fatigue experiences in under‐represented populations. Relevance to clinical practice: This integrative review supports the complex origin of fatigue and its impact on adults with T2DM. Nurses should evaluate modifiable factors related to fatigue and provide support to help improve DSM and QOL in this population.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jocn.16058",""

But little is known about how college students and their households mitigate food insecurity, particularly during a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic. The Household Observations of Meals and Environments (HOME) Study described how college students in the US utilized multilevel resources, including an on-campus food pantry, to maintain food security during the pandemic. A convenience sample of college students (n = 18) were recruited from an on-campus food pantry and provided quantitative and qualitative data through online surveys and in-depth Zoom interviews. Survey data were analyzed to describe sociodemographic characteristics. In-depth interviews were recorded, transcribed, coded, and analyzed thematically to identify emergent themes. Social support and the use of an on-campus food pantry were primary factors in maintaining a food security safety net. Students faced barriers when trying to access federal and state food assistance programs and identified multilevel resources, their food security, and the role of social support as facilitators in their perceptions of food insecurity status and experiences.

Studies suggest that greater attention to suicide prevention programs for older adults is needed as well as continued research related to interventions with older adults at risk of attempting suicide. A systematic review of the literature on suicide prevention treatment and effectiveness is fundamental to assessing existing services and developing new programs and practice standards. This systematic review of the literature extends an earlier and well-cited systematic review (1966-2009) by examining articles published between 2009 and 2021 with a focus on what types of empirically evaluated suicide prevention programs effectively prevent and reduce suicidality in older adults. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were used to gather the appropriate extant research and improve reporting accuracy. A three-stage review guided the selection of the articles. At stage one, titles were screened, which excluded 284 articles based on the inclusion criteria.

Yet, little research exists on dementia care in Chinese long-term care facilities. Our research addresses this gap in the knowledge-base by examining the challenges nursing home directors encounter as well as the coping strategies they employ to deal with these challenges. Twenty-one facility directors employed by faith-based nursing homes across 14 provinces in China participated in this study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in respondents’ native language via phone or in person. Most respondents reported a religious affiliation, and about half were female and had been facility directors for more than four years. Two researchers fluent in Mandarin and English coded interview transcripts; thematic analysis was conducted to identify patterns in the data. The results indicated four primary challenges, which pertained to recruiting and retaining nursing staff, funding, lacking support from the government, and conflicts with family members. The coping strategies included obtaining and using external resources such as volunteer visitors, operationalizing personal spiritual beliefs, and providing training to improve skills and empathy among employees. This study contributes to nursing home practice by expanding our knowledge of culturally relevant dementia management strategies in China. Suggestions to address management challenges from a policy and practical perspective include clear and sustainable financial support from the government, staff training, and staff-resident ratio regulations, seeking external resources, and integrating spiritual strategies into problem management and service quality improvement.","https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/5/Supplement_1/944/43189520/igab046.3413.pdf",""

Furthermore, a large variety of online sensors are also commonly incorporated in the manufacturing systems for online quality monitoring and control. However, the cyber-enabled environment may pose the collected online stream sensor data under high risks of cyber-physical attacks as well. Specifically, cyber-physical attacks could occur during the manufacturing process to maliciously tamper the sensor data, which could result in false alarms or failures of anomaly detection. In addition, the cyber-physical attacks may also illegally access the collected data without authorization and cause leakage of key information. Therefore, it becomes critical to develop an effective approach to protect online stream data from these attacks so that the cyber-physical security of the manufacturing systems could be assured. To achieve this goal, an integrative blockchain-enabled method, is proposed by leveraging both asymmetry encryption and camouflage techniques. A real-world case study that protects cyber-physical security of collected stream data in additive manufacturing is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that malicious tampering could be detected in a relatively short time and the risk of unauthorized data access is significantly reduced as well.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/DETC2021-72023/6801285/v002t02a035-detc2021-72023.pdf",""

Methods: Using linear mixed models, we compared differences in parent and child outcomes across three timepoints: baseline, 4 months after baseline (Time 2), and 8 months after baseline (T3). Parent outcomes included family empowerment, self-reported confidence in, and frequency of using evidence-based strategies. Child outcomes included parent-reported challenging behaviors, social communication impairments, and the number of services received. Participants were 109 Latina mothers (intervention = 54, control = 55) of children with autism spectrum disorder. Results: After intervention at both Time 2 and Time 3 in both sites, mothers in the intervention groups reported significantly greater confidence in and frequency of using evidence-based strategies, and that their child received significantly more services.

Currently, 1 in 59 children are identified with ASD in the United States. ASD refers to a range of neurological disorders that involve some degree of difficulty with communication and interpersonal relationships. The range of the spectrum for autism disorders is wide with those at the higher functioning end often able to lead relatively independent lives and complete academic programs even while demonstrating social awkwardness. Those at the lower functioning end of the autism spectrum often demonstrate physical limitations, may lack speech, and have the inability to relate socially with others. As persons with ASD age, options such as employment become increasingly important as a consideration for long‐term personal planning and quality of life. While many challenges exist for persons with ASD in obtaining and maintaining employment, some research shows that, with effective behavioral and social interventions, employment can occur. About 37% of individuals with ASD report having been employed for 12 months or more, 4 years after exiting high school. However, several studies show that individuals with ASD are more likely to lose their employment for behavioral and social interaction problems rather than their inability to perform assigned work tasks. Although Westbrook et al. (2012a, 2013, 2015) have reviewed the literature on interventions targeting employment for individuals with ASD, this review is outdated and does not account for recent developments in the field. Objectives: The objective of this review is to determine the effectiveness of employment interventions in securing and maintaining employment for adults and transition‐age youth with ASD, updating two reviews by Westbrook et al. (2012a, 2013). Search Methods: The comprehensive search strategy used to identify relevant studies included a review of 28 relevant electronic databases. Search terminology for each of the electronic databases was developed from available database thesauri. Appropriate synonyms were used to maximize the database search output. Several international databases were included among the 28 databases searched. In addition, the authors identified and reviewed gray literature through analysis of reference lists of relevant studies. Unpublished dissertations and theses were also identified through database searches. The programs of conferences held by associations and organizations relevant to ASD and employment were also searched. In sum, the search strategy replicated and expanded the prior search methods used by Westbrook et al. (2012a, 2013). Selection Criteria: Selection criteria consisted of an intervention evaluation using a randomized controlled trial or quasi‐experimental design, an employment outcome, and a population of individuals with ASD. Data Collection and Analysis: We updated the search from Westbrook et al., replicating and broadening the information retrieval processes. Our wide array of sources included electronic databases, gray literature, and conference and organization websites. Once all potentially relevant studies were located, pairs of coders evaluated the relevance of each title and abstract. Among the studies deemed potentially relevant, 278 were subjected to full‐text retrieval and screening by pairs of coders. Because many intervention studies did not include employment outcomes, only three studies met our inclusion criteria. Given the small number of included studies, meta‐analytic procedures were not used; rather, we opted to use more narrative and descriptive analysis to summarize the available evidence, including an assessment of risk of bias. Results: The systematic review update identified three studies that evaluated employment outcomes for interventions for individuals with ASD. All three studies identified in the review suggest that vocation‐focused programs may have positive impacts on the employment outcomes for individuals with ASD. Wehman et al. indicated that participants in Project SEARCH had higher employment rates than control participants at both 9‐month and 1‐year follow‐up time points. Adding autism spectrum disorder supports, Project SEARCH in Wehman et al.'s study also demonstrated higher employment rates for treatment participants than control participants at postgraduation, 3‐month follow‐up, and 12‐month follow‐up. Smith et al. found that virtual reality job interview training was able to increase the number of job offers treatment participants received compared to control participants. Authors' Conclusions: Given that prior reviews did not identify interventions with actual employment outcomes, the more recent emergence of evaluations of such programs is encouraging. This suggests that there is a growing body of evidence regarding interventions to enhance the employment outcomes for individuals with ASD but also greater need to conduct rigorous trials of vocation‐based interventions for individuals with ASD that measure employment outcomes.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/cl2.1185",""

We begin with a description of computational models for how alphabetic written language is processed. Next, we explain the roles of a dorsal sublexical system in the brain that relates print and speech, a ventral lexical system that develops the visual expertise for rapid orthographic processing at the word level, and the role of cognitive control networks that regulate attentional processes as children read. We then use studies of children, adult illiterates learning to read, and studies of poor readers involved in intervention, to demonstrate the plasticity of these neural networks in development and in relation to instruction. We provide a brief overview of the rapid increase in the field’s understanding and technology for assessing genetic influence on reading. Family studies of twins have shown that reading skills are heritable, and molecular genetic studies have identified numerous regions of the genome that may harbor candidate genes for the heritability of reading. In selected families, reading impairment has been associated with major genetic effects, despite individual gene contributions across the broader population that appear to be small. Neural and genetic studies do not prescribe how children should be taught to read, but these studies have underscored the critical role of early intervention and ongoing support. These studies also have highlighted how structured instruction that facilitates access to the sublexical components of words is a critical part of training the brain to read.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/rrq.439",""

A proper understanding of these flow characteristics can provide a better idea of the cooling capabilities of the system in both normal operation and accident scenarios. In order to enhance the accuracy of computationally efficient, intermediate fidelity modeling, high-fidelity simulation may be used to generate correlative data. For this research, NekRS, a GPU-enabled spectral-element computational fluid dynamics code, was used in order to produce the high-fidelity flow data for beds of 1,568 and 45,000 pebbles. Idaho National Lab’s Pronghorn porous media code was used as the intermediate fidelity code. The results of the high-fidelity model were separated into multiple concentric regions in order to extract porosity and velocity averages in each region. The porosity values were input into the Pronghorn model and the resulting velocity profile was compared with that from NekRS. Both cases were run with a Reynolds number of 20,000 based on pebble diameter. The Pronghorn results were found to significantly overestimate the velocity in the outermost region indicating that changes in the porosity alone do not cause the difference in fluid velocity. We conclude that further work is necessary to develop a more effective drag coefficient correlation for the near-wall region and improve predictive capabilities of intermediate fidelity models.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/ICONE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/ICONE28-65759/6775475/v004t14a086-icone28-65759.pdf",""

Yet, survey research on racial and gender attitudes tends to treat these components as independent. We apply latent class analysis to a set of racial and gender attitude items from the General Social Survey (1977 to 2018) to identify four configurations of individuals’ simultaneous views on race and gender. Two of these configurations hold unified progressive or regressive racial and gender attitudes. The other two formations have discordant racial and gender attitudes, where progressive views on one aspect combine with regressive views on the other. In the majority of survey years, the most commonly held configuration endorsed gender equality but espoused new racialist views that attributed racial disparities to cultural deficiencies. This perspective has become increasingly common since 1977 and is most prevalent among White women and White men, likely due to racial-group interest. Black women and Black men, in contrast, are more likely to embrace progressive racial and gender attitudes. We argue that White men’s gender egalitarianism may be rooted in self-interest, aimed at acquiring resources through intimate relationships. In contrast, Black men adopt progressive racial and gender attitudes to form a necessary coalition with Black women to challenge racism.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/00031224211033582",""

Hemp is the agricultural product of Cannabis sativa L. which must contain less than 0.3% tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive component common to marijuana. Hemp oil, cold-pressed from C. sativa seed, has been gaining popularity over recent years for its use in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and human food products. Like most oilseeds, this leaves an oilseed meal with a potential for inclusion in livestock feeds. Thus, our objective was to quantify the sources of variation in the nutritive value of hempseed meal. Hempseed meal samples were obtained from commercial oil processing facilities (n = 4). Across these facilities, samples represented 15 independent hempseed meal batches. Our experimental design was a completely randomized design including the random effects of source, batch within source, and replicate within batch by source (laboratory replication). Samples were assayed for NDF, ADF, ADL, CP, and IVTD. Source had no contribution to variance for NDF, ADF, ADL, or CP (P ≥ 0.20). However, batch within source had a significant contribution to variation for NDF (μ = 50.1%; P = 0.01), ADF (μ = 36.8%; P = 0.01), ADL (μ = 12.9%; P &lt; 0.01), and CP (μ = 30.9%; P &lt; 0.01). Irrespective of the differences in nutritive value, there was no contribution to variation (P ≥ 0.23) of any measured effect on IVTD (μ = 53.0%). Results are interpreted to mean that, while variation exists among hempseed meal samples with respect to nutritive value, the viability of hempseed meal as a livestock feed source is strong.","http://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/99/Supplement_3/479/40568354/skab235.844.pdf",""

Understanding movement and foraging patterns of species in dynamic and diverse habitats can allow managers to develop more effective conservation plans. Threatened lemurs in Madagascar are an example where management plans and protected areas are typically created to encompass large, remaining forests rather than the resource needs of the target species. MethodsTo gain an understanding of golden-crowned sifaka ( Propithecus tattersalli ) movement patterns, including space use and habitat selection, across their range of inhabited forest types, we combined behavior data with Dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Models and Resource Selection Functions. We also examined the influence of abiotic, biotic, and anthropogenic factors on home range size, movement rates, and foraging patterns. ResultsWe found that home range size and movement rates differed between seasons, with increased core area size and movement in the rainy season. Forest type also played a role in foraging behavior with lemur groups in humid forest avoiding roads in both seasons, groups in the dry deciduous forest avoiding road networks in the rainy season, and groups in the moderate evergreen forest displaying no selection or avoidance of road networks while foraging. ConclusionOur study illustrates the importance of studying primate groups across seasons as well as across forest types, as developing conservation plans as a single snapshot can give an inaccurate assessment of their natural behavior and resources needs. More specifically, by understanding how forest type influences golden-crowned sifaka movement and foraging behavior, we can make conservation management plans specific to the individual forest types they inhabit (humid, moderate evergreen, dry deciduous, littoral, etc.), rather than the region as a whole.","https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1001185/v1",""

Based on correlations among data from different environments within two adjacent years and heritability estimated in each environment, yield data from 87 environments were selected and assigned to two correlation-based groups. The yield best linear unbiased estimation (BLUE) from each group, along with reaction to greenbug and Hessian fly in each line, were used for GWAS to reveal genomic regions associated with yield and insect resistance. A total of 74 genomic regions were associated with grain yield and two of them were commonly detected in both correlation-based groups.

Introduction:: In general, the large size is associated with increased longevity among species of mammals and birds but is associated with decreased longevity within individual species such as dogs and mice. In this study, we examined the relationship between measures of individual body size and longevity in a captive population of speckled cockroaches (Nauphoeta cineria). Methods:: Newly molted adults of both sexes were removed from a mass colony housed in multiple terraria and housed individually with food and water provided ad libitum for the duration of their lifespan. Thrice weekly, the status (i.e., live/dead) of individual cockroaches was noted for the duration of the study. Individuals found dead were weighed and measured to obtain body mass and morphometric measures, and the age at the time of death was recorded. The relationship between body size and lifespan was assessed. Result:: Contrary to what is commonly seen within vertebrates, large cockroaches were longerlived than their smaller counterparts. Specifically, body mass, body length, and pronotum width were all significantly correlated with the age at death in a mixed population of males and females (n = 94). In addition, we found that the longevity of a historically larger population in terms of both body mass and body length was significantly longer-lived than the population used in this study. Conclusion:: These data indicate there is a significant interaction between body size and aging in this species and that increased size results in a survival advantage. There is evidence in the literature indicating that a positive relationship between size and longevity may be common in insects.","https://eurekaselect.com/article/download/195091",""

However, the DMLS method produces a significant and unique surface roughness. Previous work in scaled passages analyzed pressure losses and friction factors associated with the rough surfaces, as well as investigated the velocity profiles and turbulent flow characteristics within the passage. In this study, the heat transfer characteristics of scaled additively manufactured surfaces were measured using infrared (IR) thermography. Roughness panels were CNC machined from plates of aluminum 6061 to create near isothermal roughness elements when heated. Fluid resistance differences between the aluminum roughness panels and roughness panels constructed from ABS plastic using the same roughness patterns from McClain et al. (2020) were investigated. Finally, the overall thermal performance enhancements and friction losses were assessed through calculation of surface averaged “global thermal performance” ratios. The global thermal performance characterizations indicate results in-line with those found for traditional commercial roughness and slightly below traditional internal passage convection enhancement methods such as swirl chambers, dimples, and ribs. The passages investigated in this study do not include compressibility effects or the long-wavelength artifacts and channel geometric deviations observed by Wildgoose et al. (2020). However, the results of this study indicate that, based on the roughness augmentation alone, artificial convective cooling enhancers such as turbulators or dimples may still be required for additively manufactured turbine component cooling.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/GT/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/GT2021-59684/6758283/v05bt15a018-gt2021-59684.pdf",""

At AI, heifers were randomly assigned new treatment groups (post-AI) which created four pre- x post-AI diet treatments (High-High, High-Low, Low-High, and Low-Low). Post-AI dietary treatments continued until uteri were flushed for embryo recovery (d 7 or 8 post-AI). Blood samples were collected on d -3,-2,-1, 0 (AI day), 1,3,5,7, and 8 for analysis of plasma cholesterol concentrations using a colorimetric assay. Uterine flushes were analyzed for concentrations of Mg, Al, P, S, K, Ca, Cu, Zn, Se, and Fe by ICPMS. Plasma cholesterol (repeated measures) and uterine mineral concentrations were analyzed using the MIXED procedures in SAS. Plasma cholesterol concentrations changed over time (P &lt; 0.0001); however, there were no differences between treatments (P &gt; 0.10). There was an effect of embryo presence on uterine flush mineral concentrations for Mg (P &lt; 0.04), Al (P &lt; 0.01), S (P &lt; 0.01), K (P &lt; 0.01), and Ca (P &lt; 0.01), with decreased concentrations when uterine flushes contained an embryo.

To probe these validity limits, we used a mobile EEG system to record electrophysiological signals from human participants while they were located within a controlled laboratory environment and an uncontrolled outdoor environment exhibiting several moderate background influences. Participants performed two tasks during these recordings, one engaging brain activity related to several complex cognitive functions (number sense, attention, memory, executive function) and the other engaging two default brain states. We computed EEG spectral power over three frequency bands (theta: 4–7 Hz, alpha: 8–13 Hz, low beta: 14–20 Hz) where EEG oscillatory activity is known to correlate with the neurocognitive states engaged by these tasks. Null hypothesis significance testing yielded significant EEG power effects typical of the neurocognitive states engaged by each task, but only a beta-band power difference between the two background recording environments during the default brain state. Bayesian analysis showed that the remaining environment null effects were unlikely to reflect measurement insensitivities. This overall pattern of results supports the external validity of laboratory EEG power findings for complex and default neurocognitive states engaged within moderately uncontrolled environments.","https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/11/3/330/pdf",""

Indeed, this figure in Gothic literature helps to push the bounds of subjective tension so central to the genre. This article examines Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897) as an entry into the canon of doppelgänger fiction by complicating traditional readings of the central relationship between Count Dracula and Jonathan Harker. By revisiting the novel within the framework of a doppelgänger narrative, this article suggests that part of the real terror for Stoker's fin-de-siècle audience lies in the novel's timing. Located in the gap between the retreating Romantic and advancing high modern epochs, the novel dramatizes the apprehensions of a culture experiencing enormous technological and social upheaval. Specifically, it offers in its doubled pair a means to navigate those anxieties.","https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/full-xml/10.3366/gothic.2021.0078",""

Additionally, some research has demonstrated that victim characteristics can exacerbate racial disparity in outcomes for offenders, but little research has focused on the arrest stage. We use a quasi-experimental approach that examines incidents involving co-offending pairs to isolate the influence of offender race on arrest, beyond any characteristics of the incident itself, and we test for moderating effects of victim race and sex on racial disparities in arrest. Our findings reveal that, on average, when two offenders of different races commit the same offense together against the same victim, Black offenders are significantly more likely to be arrested than their White co-offending partners, especially for assault offenses. More importantly, this effect—for both assaults and homicides—is particularly strong when the victim is a White woman. Because these differences are between two offenders who commit the same offense together, we argue that the most plausible explanation for the differences is the presence of racial bias or discrimination.","https://academic.oup.com/socpro/article-pdf/70/2/297/50131763/spab043.pdf",""

Moreover, this study specifies how the consistent use of IoT technologies results in substantial organizational competitiveness. The paper also explains how IoT can be referred to as a new component of business analytics and digital marketing and discusses the challenges related to introducing IoT solutions. The most pressing issues that need to be addressed in the IoT context are described as ethical and data privacy issues. It can be explained by the fact that a substantial amount of data is generated during the development of IoT solutions, which raises the question of whether the respective information could be properly managed. It necessitates implementing a transparent, ethical framework, which should be supported by an adequately regulatory process. The extensive exploration of IoT solutions allows academics and marketing practitioners to generate a wide range of data that can be used to improve products and services provided to diverse consumer groups. Therefore, this paper offers a framework for the collaboration process between academics and practitioners. This collaboration in developing IoT tools is marked by adopting a holistic approach to facilitating the progress of such innovation. Academic researchers’ expertise can be utilized to generate creative and innovative ideas on the IoT sector. The combination of important theoretical assumptions and practical experience is vital to achieving the strategic goals of the collaboration between academics and practitioners.","",""

FW is the fraction of unconstrained water within an image voxel, which can be estimated from diffusion‐weighted images. T2‐weighted Fluid‐Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) white matter hyperintensity (WMH) is a widely used index to assess the damages caused by CSVD. It is critical to characterize how FW content is altered in WMH lesions. In this work, we proposed a data processing framework to assess FW distributions in WMH and normal‐appearing WM as well as in different WM fiber tracts. Method: Single‐shell diffusion‐weighted image (SS‐DWI) and T2 FLAIR image data of 133 cognitively normal (CN) adults (Table 1) were obtained from the ADNI dataset (http://adni.loni.usc.edu). FW maps were generated from SS‐DWI images using the DIPY software package (https://dipy.org/). WMH lesions were identified with the lesion segmentation toolbox implemented in SPM. We co‐registered FW and WMH maps of individual subjects in the MNI space. Then we derived group WM fiber tracts using the tract‐based spatial statistics (TBSS). Finally, we examined the localization of WMH and FW in the major WM tracts. Result: Figure 1 shows the FW map, FLAIR image, and WMH lesion from a representative subject. Figure 2 shows group average and individual FW distributions in WMH and normal‐appearing WM. Two sample T‐Test found that FW content in WMH is significantly higher than that in normal‐appearing WM (mean FW and standard deviation FW in WMH are 0.430 and 0.112, mean FW and standard deviation FW in normal‐appearing WM are 0.203 and 0.06, P < 1×10 Conclusion: We developed an image processing pipeline to estimate FW changes in WMH lesions and normal‐appearing WM. Free water content is elevated in WMH lesions, which is likely driven by CSVD.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/alz.057398",""

LP-SIM uses sub-wavelength illumination patterns to encode high spatial frequency information. It can enhance the resolution up to three-fold before gaps in the optical transfer function (OTF) support arise. For blinking fluorophores or for quantum antibunching, an intensity correlation analysis induces higher harmonics of the illumination pattern and enlarges the effective OTF. This enables ultrahigh resolutions without gaps in the OTF support, and thus a fully deterministic imaging scheme. We present simulations that include shot and external noise and demonstrate the resolution power under realistic photon budgets. The technique has potential in light microscopy where low-intensity illumination is paramount while aiming for high spatial but moderate temporal resolutions.","https://opg.optica.org/viewmedia.cfm?URI=ol-46-7-1554&seq=0",""

A significant portion of the literature deals with the band Meshuggah, but the music of countless artists scattered across manifold subgenres remains unexplored. Widening the focus on such a large repertoire not only helps remedy this issue, but serves to inform one recent music-theoretical topic that relies on a broad stylistic understanding: time feels. To date, scholars have mainly limited the discussion of time feels to the kick and snare drums (e.g., de Clercq 2016), and indeed, these instruments ultimately determine a feel. I argue, however, that different uses of guitar, bass, and cymbals can reinforce, clarify, or contradict the feel laid down by the kick and snare. In this article, I describe several categories of guitar and bass riff types and timekeeping cymbals. I then discuss how their associations with certain time-feel contexts inform further analyses. To this end, I draw from post-millennial metal music in various subgenres including black metal, death metal, doom metal, grindcore, metalcore, progressive metal, sludge metal, and thrash metal.","",""

However, replication of these studies is limited. In particular, a lack of investigations exists in examining optimism as individuals transition across older adulthood. Considering the dearth of literature that examines the influence of religion/spirituality and humor on the optimism of older adults, 203 members of Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes, age 65 years and older, from Idaho and California completed pen and paper or electronic surveys. The study used hierarchical multiple regression analysis to examine the impact of age, positive religion/spirituality coping skills, and humor on the optimism of community-dwelling older adults. The participant’s gender significantly explained a 19.3% variance in the optimism scores, whereas age did not significantly contribute to the model (R Change =.000). Positive religious or spiritual coping skills and humor significantly contributed to the variance in optimism scores, explaining a 2.3% and 21.6% variance, respectively. In the final model (F (1, 202, = 13.78, p = .000), all variables except age significantly contributed to the model with humor revealing the highest beta value (beta = .467, p = .000). The findings suggest that optimism is perceived differently by gender but does not change with age. While positive religious coping skills influence optimism, internal or external humor strategies may be more helpful to instill, promote or maintain optimism in older adults. The addition of humor assessment items in wellness evaluations and humor-infused interventions may foster optimism in community-dwelling older adults.","https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/5/Supplement_1/904/43188904/igab046.3281.pdf",""

Typically, mme and their hosts differ in mineral assemblage and the compositions of phenocrysts and matrix glass. In contrast, in many arc plutons, the mineral assemblages in mme are the same as in their host granitic rocks, and major-element mineral compositions are similar or identical. These similarities lead to difficulties in identifying mixing end members except through the use of bulk-rock compositions, which themselves may reflect various degrees of hybridization and potentially melt loss. This work describes the variety of enclave types and occurrences in the equigranular Half Dome unit (eHD) of the Tuolumne Intrusive Complex and then focuses on textural and mineral composition data on five porphyritic mme from the eHD. Specifically, major- and trace-element compositions and zoning patterns of plagioclase and hornblende were measured in the mme and their adjacent host granitic rocks. In each case, the majority of plagioclase phenocrysts in the mme (i.e., large crystals) were derived from a rhyolitic end member. The trace-element compositions and zoning patterns in these plagioclase phenocrysts indicate that each mme formed by hybridization with a distinct rhyolitic magma. In some cases, hybridization involved a single mixing event, whereas in others, evidence for at least two mixing events is preserved. In contrast, some hornblende phenocrysts grew from the enclave magma, and others were derived from the rhyolitic end member. Moreover, the composition of hornblende in the immediately adjacent host rock is distinct from hornblende typically observed in the eHD. Although primary basaltic magmas are thought to be parental to the mme, little or no evidence of such parents is preserved in the enclaves. Instead, the data indicate that hybridization of already hybrid andesitic enclave magmas with rhyolitic magmas in the eHD involved multiple andesitic and rhyolitic end members, which in turn is consistent with the eHD representing an amalgamation of numerous, compositionally distinct magma reservoirs. This conclusion applies to enclaves sampled &lt;30 m from one another. Moreover, during amalgamation of various rhyolitic reservoirs, some mme were evidently disrupted from a surrounding mush and thus carried remnants of that mush as their immediately adjacent host. We suggest that detailed study of mineral compositions and zoning in plutonic mme provides a means to identify magmatic processes that cannot be deciphered from bulk-rock analysis.","https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geosphere/article-pdf/17/2/352/5259592/352.pdf",""

Rhythmicity is a central regulator of life and a sentinel for animal health and metabolism, thus chronic stress and disease can disrupt behavioral patterns. Feedlot cattle may exhibit irregularities in circadian rhythms due to social, environmental, and nutritional stressors and may benefit from behavior-based management strategies. This study characterized the hourly behavioral patterns of feedlot cattle with and without environmental enrichment, established behavioral expectations for animal managers, and proposed practical interventions. Fifty-four crossbred steers were shipped to Texas A&M AgriLife Feedlot in Bushland, Texas, blocked by weight, and assigned to one of six pens (n = 9 steers/pen), half of which had a cattle brush and half did not. Frequency of headbutting, mounting, bar licking, tongue rolling, allogrooming, and brush usage was decoded from video recordings of cattle from 08:00h to 17:30h on d -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 relative to brush implementation. The impact of time (hour), treatment, and their interaction on cattle behavior were evaluated using PROC MIXED in SAS. Brush use (P &lt; 0.0001), allogrooming (P &lt; 0.0001), and mounting (P &lt; 0.0001) were performed at lower frequencies during early hours of the day and at higher frequencies in the afternoon. Both tongue rolling (P &lt; 0.0001) and bar licking (P &lt; 0.0349) occurred most often during daylight hours in accordance with a diurnal pattern. Major periods of headbutting (P &lt; 0.0001) were observed in the morning and afternoon. Behavioral expectations were characterized so that stockpeople could observe the prevalence of each behavior during morning, midday, and evening to facilitate the implementation of best management practices. Proposed interventions include medical treatment, modified pen surface or bunk management, altered stocking density, and/or introduction of environmental enrichment.","http://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/99/Supplement_3/313/40567972/skab235.575.pdf",""

Varieties of organic and inorganic materials either in the form of small molecules or nano‐sized materials have been engineered as a contrast agent (CA) to enhance image resolution among different tissues for the detection of abnormalities such as cancer and vascular occlusion. Among different innovative imaging agents, contrast agents coupled with biologically derived endogenous platform shows the promising application in the biomedical field, including drug delivery and bioimaging. Strategy using biocomponents such as cells or products of cells as a delivery system predominantly reduces the toxic behavior of its cargo, as these systems reduce non‐specific distribution by navigating its cargo toward the targeted location. The hypothesis is that depending on the original biological role of the naïve cell, the contrast agents carried by such a system can provide corresponding natural designated behavior. Therefore, by combining properties of conventional synthetic molecules and nanomaterials with endogenous cell body, new solutions in the field of bioimaging to overcome biological barriers have been offered as innovative bioengineering.

The tyrosine kinase inhibitor gilteritinib is approved for the treatment of relapse/refractory AML with FLT3 mutations, yet its mechanism of action is not completely understood. Here, we sought to identify additional therapeutic targets that can be exploited to enhance gilteritinib's antileukemic effect. Based on unbiased transcriptomic analyses, we identified the glutamine transporter SNAT1 (SLC38A1) as a novel target of gilteritinib that leads to impaired glutamine uptake and utilization within leukemic cells. Using metabolomics and metabolic flux analyses, we found that gilteritinib decreased glutamine metabolism through the TCA cycle and cellular levels of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate. In addition, gilteritinib treatment was associated with decreased ATP production and glutathione synthesis and increased reactive oxygen species, resulting in cellular senescence. Finally, we found that the glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 enhanced antileukemic effect of gilteritinib in ex vivo studies using human primary FLT3-ITD–positive AML cells harboring mutations in the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate, producing α-ketoglutarate. Collectively, this work has identified a previously unrecognized, gilteritinib-sensitive metabolic pathway downstream of SLC38A1 that causes decreased glutaminolysis and disruption of redox homeostasis. These findings provide a rationale for the development and therapeutic exploration of targeted combinatorial treatment strategies for this subset of relapse/refractory AML.","https://aacrjournals.org/mct/article-pdf/20/11/2207/3198643/2207.pdf",""

In this study, the authors have explored different machine learning techniques to classify all-rounders into bowling all-rounders or batting all-rounders based on their observed performance statistics. In particular, logistic regression, linear discriminant function, quadratic discriminant function, naïve Bayes, support vector machine, and random forest classification methods were explored. Evaluation of the performance of the classification methods was done using the metrics accuracy and area under the ROC curve. While all the six methods performed well, logistic regression, linear discriminant function, quadratic discriminant function, and support vector machine showed outstanding performance suggesting that these methods can be used to develop an automated classification rule to classify all-rounders in cricket. Given the rising popularity of cricket, and the increasing revenue generated by the sport, the use of such a prediction tool could be of tremendous benefit to decision-makers in cricket.","https://content.iospress.com/download?id=10.3233/JSA-200467",""

Abundant genome sequencing and analyses of gene regulatory networks illustrate that genes and entire pathways are conserved, reused, and elaborated in the evolution of diversity. Predating these discoveries, 19th-century embryologists observed that though morphology at birth varies tremendously, certain stages of vertebrate embryogenesis appear remarkably similar across vertebrates. In the mid to late 20th century, anatomical variability of early and late-stage embryos and conservation of mid-stages embryos (the “phylotypic” stage) was named the hourglass model of diversification. This model has found mixed support in recent analyses comparing gene expression across species possibly owing to differences in species, embryonic stages, and gene sets compared. We compare 186 microarray and RNA-seq data sets covering embryogenesis in six vertebrate species. We use an unbiased clustering approach to group stages of embryogenesis by transcriptomic similarity and ask whether gene expression similarity of clustered embryonic stages deviates from a null expectation. We characterize expression conservation patterns of each gene at each evolutionary node after correcting for phylogenetic nonindependence. We find significant enrichment of genes exhibiting early conservation, hourglass, late conservation patterns in both microarray and RNA-seq data sets. Enrichment of genes showing patterned conservation through embryogenesis indicates diversification of embryogenesis may be temporally constrained. However, the circumstances under which each pattern emerges remain unknown and require both broad evolutionary sampling and systematic examination of embryogenesis across species.","http://academic.oup.com/gbe/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/gbe/evab160/38897299/evab160.pdf",""

Among these groups are freshwater gastropods (stygosnails), which represent a widespread and taxonomically diverse component of groundwater ecosystems in North America. However, owing to sampling difficulty and lack of targeted study, stygosnails remain among the most understudied of all subterranean groups. We conducted a literature review to assess the biodiversity and geographic associations of stygosnails, along with the threats, management activities, and policy considerations related to the groundwater systems they inhabit. We identified 39 stygosnail species known to occur in a range of groundwater habitats from karst regions in the United States and Mexico. Most stygosnails exhibit extreme narrow‐range endemism, resulting in a high risk of extinction from a single catastrophic event. We found that anthropogenically driven changes to surface environments have led to changes in local hydrology and degradation of groundwater systems inhabited by stygosnails such as increased sedimentation, introduction of invasive species, groundwater extraction, or physical collapse of water‐bearing passages. Consequently, 32 of the 39 described stygosnail species in the United States and Mexico have been assessed as imperiled under NatureServe criteria, and 10 species have been assessed as threatened under International Union for Conservation of Nature criteria. Compared with surface species of freshwater snails, stygosnail conservation is uniquely hindered by difficulties associated with accessing subterranean habitats for monitoring and management. Furthermore, only three species were found to have federal protection in either the United States or Mexico, and current laws regulating wildlife and water pollution at the state and federal level may be inadequate for protecting stygosnail habitats. As groundwater systems continue to be manipulated and relied on by humans, groundwater‐restricted fauna such as stygosnails should be studied so unique biodiversity can be protected.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/cobi.13722",""

In response to the loss and degradation of oak savannas, associated wildlife populations have experienced long-term declines. For example, 70% of disturbance-dependent bird species in the United States have experienced declines, with most of these species being associated with grasslands, oak savannas, and open forest communities. Few studies have documented the success of restoration in post oak savanna systems in regard to breeding bird assemblages. Our objective was to quantify avian abundance, density, species richness, and assemblage structure under three site conditions (reference, restored, and partially restored [aka unrestored]) within post oak savannas at Gus Engeling Wildlife Management Area in eastern Texas. We conducted vegetation and avian transect surveys postrestoration (2016–2017) and compared our results with prerestoration baseline surveys conducted in 2009. Restoration initiated in 2010 was partially successful, with vegetation changes that closely resemble presettlement characteristics, with the appearance of obligate grassland species. Specifically, prerestoration, one dickcissel Spiza americana and no lark sparrows Chondestes grammacus were detected. By 2017, dickcissel density in the restored sites was similar to densities recorded on tallgrass prairie and other high-quality habitat in the southern portion of its range. Lark sparrows were also detected, but at low densities. We also observed the persistence and increase of several woodland and open woodland species over time. These patterns are likely attributed to the creation of a mosaic of microhabitats selected by these species, such as the persistence of mottes, as well as their increased edge-to-area ratios. Restoration sites that are larger in size and in closer proximity to other restored or remnant savannas should have a higher priority to increase their likelihood of recolonization by target species. Restoration efforts may still be successful in more isolated areas, such as Gus Engeling Wildlife Management Area, but conducting postrestoration monitoring will further elucidate site-specific restoration dynamics.","http://meridian.allenpress.com/jfwm/article-pdf/12/1/61/2883359/i1944-687x-12-1-61.pdf",""

In prolonged field care (PFC) situations, medical evacuation could be delayed for days. During this time, burn wounds can become infected, detrimentally impact neighboring tissue, and cause systemic immune responses. Therefore, it is essential to test and evaluate non-surgical debridement agents that could be implemented prior to reaching a Role 3 military treatment facility. This work details how the proprietary proteolytic gel SN514 impacts burn debridement when applied within a PFC-like timeline. SN514 contains an enzyme formulation that is thermostable, easy to apply, and selectively degrades non-viable tissue in vitro and in vivo. Methods: Deep-partial thickness contact burns were created using an established porcine model and covered with gauze or an antimicrobial incise drape. Four days later, the burns were treated with one of five treatments: 0.2% SN514, 0.8% SN514, a vehicle control, gauze, or an antimicrobial silver dressing. Treatments were re-applied every 24 hours for 72 to 96 hours. The effects of the treatment regiments were compared histologically. Biopsies were also taken to monitor bacterial contamination levels. Results: Burns treated with SN514 were partially debrided and visually distinct from those treated with gauze, the silver dressing, or the vehicle control. Preliminary analyses suggest that SN514-treated burns that had been covered with “dry” gauze had a much lower debridement efficiency than those treated with the incise drape. This suggests that SN514 debridement efficiency may depend on the presence of a moist eschar. Preliminary analyses also suggest that there was little difference in burn wound bacterial counts among the five treatment groups. Conclusions: SN514 is able to debride burns that experienced delayed treatment, without any evidence of harm to the surrounding tissue or evidence of exacerbating the original burn injury. SN514-treated wounds displayed little to no blood loss and did not increase burn wound infection levels compared to wounds treated with gauze or an antimicrobial silver dressing.","http://academic.oup.com/jbcr/article-pdf/42/Supplement_1/S191/36836656/irab032.316.pdf",""

Data were collected on 394 nursing calves from 4 sets of cows (years 1953, 1959, 1964, 1974) of various breeds in which monthly milk yield and butterfat content, individual calf feed intake, and birth and weaning weights were measured during their first three lactations. Cows were milked at 14-d intervals to determine milk yield. The calf feed intake equations used to predict observed feed intake were Equation 9.1 (TED06; Tedeschi et al., 2006, In “Nutrient Digestion and Utilization in Farm Animals: Modeling Approaches”) and Equation 25 (TED09; Tedeschi and Fox, 2009, J.

In turn, CEOs can influence important decisions related to changes in R&D spending—the kind of spending with the potential to lead to innovation. We seek to understand the motivation and conditions under which CEOs may influence R&D spending changes. Drawing on regulatory focus theory, this study investigates how CEO motivation affects changes in firm R&D spending. We explore the effect of CEO promotion and prevention foci on yearly R&D increase. We use a panel dataset of 688 S&P 1500 firms to test our hypotheses. Our findings suggest a negative relationship between CEO prevention focus and R&D increase, while CEO promotion focus produces no meaningful effect. We further test CEO compensation as a moderating mechanism, testing both incentive and fixed CEO compensation. We find that incentive compensation negatively moderates the relationship between CEO promotion focus and R&D increase, and positively moderates the relationship between CEO prevention focus and R&D increase. Additionally, CEO fixed income negatively moderates the relationship between CEO prevention focus and R&D increase. Based on these results we discuss theoretical implications of our findings, including differing effects of CEO regulatory focus on firm risk‐taking behavior and how compensation packages may alter those effects. We further discuss the practical necessity for boards of directors to understand both the R&D goals of an organization and the individual motivational orientation of CEOs when crafting compensation packages.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jpim.12591",""

Significant compromise of the TMJ can be debilitating functionally, psychologically, and aesthetically. Reconstruction of the mandibular condyle is rarely straightforward. Multiple considerations must be accounted for when preparing for condylar reconstruction such as ensuring eradication of all chronically diseased or infected bone, proving clear oncologic margins following tumor resection, or achieving stability of the surrounding architecture in the setting of a traumatic injury. Today, there is not one single gold-standard reconstructive method or material; ongoing investigation and innovation continue to improve and transform condylar reconstruction.

The empirical evidence affirms a positive influence of TSI participation on two TSR outcomes (application and access to higher education), according to data from a longitudinal study of 2,068 refugees (Study 1) that relies on propensity score matching and regression analysis. Study 2 uses qualitative data from six focus groups and identifies 16 barriers to successful refugee integration; it also identifies four individual strategies to overcoming those integration barriers.

Combined, ESDs and state‐and‐transition models (STMs) describe existing and potential plant community dynamics. Unlike previous methods used to assess rangeland health, STMs take into account that multiple states exist in space and time across sites and that reversible and directional changes in vegetation can occur in response to factors such as fire, erosion, weather, and management activities. Wildlife responses are seldom incorporated into this framework. However, combining STMs, ESDs, and species‐specific habitat use and demographic data could provide land managers with tools that classify current ecosystem conditions, predict vegetative change, and inform management for maintaining or improving key habitat features for species of interest. To demonstrate a multi‐species, multi‐response STM approach for wildlife management, we quantified vegetation structure and composition as a function of time since prescribed burning and wildfire in four geographically distinct study areas.

This study evaluates how repeated daily stage fluctuations, representative of hydropeaking conditions, influence aerobic respiration of river‐sourced dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the riparian exchange zone using reactive flow and transport simulations. Over 50 hypothetical scenarios were modelled to evaluate how the duration of the daily flood signal, river DOC concentration, aquifer hydraulic conductivity and ambient groundwater flow condition affect the fate and transport of DOC and DO in the riparian aquifer. Time series subsurface snapshots highlight how the various factors influence the subsurface distribution of DOC and DO. The total mass of DOC respired per meter of river had a wide range depending on the parameters, spanning from 1.4 to 71 g over 24‐h, with high hydraulic conductivity and losing ambient groundwater flow conditions favouring the largest amount of DOC respired. The ratio of DOC mass entering the riparian zone with the mass returning to the river showed that as little as 5% to as much as 76% of the DOC that enters the bank during stage fluctuations returns to the river. This return ratio is dependent on river DOC concentration, hydraulic conductivity and ambient groundwater flow. The results illustrate that stage variations due to river regulation can be a significant control on aerobic respiration in riparian exchange zones.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hyp.14386",""

Then, based on the outcome of clustering analysis, the sensitive counties are Cottle, Stonewall, Bexar, Tarrant, Dallas, Harris, Jim hogg, and Real, corresponding to Southeast Texas analysis in Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) modeling.

By using the PCA, we extracted five factors related to mortality of COVID-19, involved population and hospitalization, adult population, natural supply, economic condition, air quality or medical care. We established the GWR model to seek the sensitive factors. The result shows that adult population, economic condition, air quality, and medical care are the sensitive factors.

The effect of this process in gliomas is mostly unknown with relatively little research examining the effects of chromosomal instability on patient outcome and therapeutic efficacy, although studies have shown that overall/total copy number variation (CNV) is elevated in higher histologic grades and in cases with more rapid progression and shorter patient survival. Herein, we examine a 70-gene mRNA expression signature (CIN70), which has been previously shown to correlate tightly with chromosomal instability, in 2 independent cohorts of IDH-mutant astrocytomas (total n = 241), IDH-wildtype astrocytomas (n = 228), and oligodendrogliomas (n = 128). Our results show that CIN70 expression levels correlate with total CNV, as well as higher grade, progression-free survival, and overall survival in both IDH-mutant and IDH-wildtype astrocytomas. In oligodendrogliomas, these mRNA signatures correlate with total CNV but not consistently with clinical outcome. These data suggest that chromosomal instability is an underlying factor in aggressive behavior and progression of a subset of diffuse astrocytomas. In addition, chromosomal instability may in part explain the poor response of diffuse gliomas to treatment and may serve as a future therapeutic target.","http://academic.oup.com/jnen/article-pdf/80/4/354/36664140/nlab008.pdf",""

The current standards of care for KOA are aimed toward reducing pain and are largely comprised of analgesic medications, but existing pharmacologic approaches often produce significant adverse effects. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that KOA pain is characterized by alterations in pain-related brain mechanisms. Cranial electrical stimulation (CES), which delivers a low-amplitude alternating electric current to the brain, can facilitate the reversal of maladaptive brain function. Portable CES devices can be used at home with real-time monitoring through a secure videoconferencing platform to facilitate high adherence. Thus, the purpose of this pilot clinical study was to examine the preliminary efficacy of remotely supervised CES on clinical pain severity in older adults with KOA. Thirty participants with KOA were randomly assigned to receive 10 daily sessions of remotely supervised CES with 0.1 mA at a frequency of 0.5 Hz for 60 minutes (n=15) or sham CES (n=15). We measured clinical pain severity using the numeric rating scale (NRS; range, 0 – 100). Participants (67% female) had a mean age of 59 years. Active CES significantly reduced scores on the NRS (Cohen’s d = 1.43, P &lt; 0.01). Participants tolerated CES well without any adverse events. Our findings demonstrate the promising clinical efficacy of remotely supervised CES for older adults with KOA. Future studies with larger-scale randomized controlled trials with follow-up assessments are needed to validate and extend our findings.","https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/5/Supplement_1/165/43180317/igab046.632.pdf",""

However, our understanding of growth in the past is subject to a number of methodological challenges. This study aims to model the skeletal growth of past populations by considering the challenges associated with the data collection process and the challenges associated with the age estimation procedures. Materials and methods: We use skeletal remains from two historic African American cemeteries in the American South to model femoral diaphyseal length‐for‐age. We estimate the age of each individual using dental development techniques and present growth curves as both a product of the maximum likelihood (MLE) age estimate and the estimated posterior age distribution. Growth was compared against a reference sample from the University of Colorado Child Research Council Study. Results: The results of our analyses showed that femoral diaphyseal length in two historic African American communities is small‐for‐estimated age as compared to a modern reference sample. However, the magnitude and characterization of this difference is variable when taking into account the broader posterior age distribution. Discussion: Both samples may be small‐for‐age due to physiological stress associated with racism, inequality, and the compounding effects of early urbanization. However, the interpretation of growth in the past is muddled when considering the relationship between the study sample and the reference sample, when accounting for uncertainty in the age estimation procedure, and the error‐inducing steps taken during the data collection process. Future interpretation of skeletal growth in the past must include a full account of the possible sources of error in order to present an accurate representation of growth.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ajpa.24415",""

In 2010, Mississippi State University surveyed 1,078 Texas freshwater catfish anglers to examine their catch‐related attitudes and trip preferences by using a stated choice experiment. The study showed that the responding freshwater catfish anglers could be grouped into five clusters based on their catch‐related attitudes. We used ESRI’s Business Analyst extension to define the primary customer segments (also called “Tapestries”) within these five catch‐related clusters. We used principal components analysis followed by a similarity profile analysis to help us identify differences among the customer segments for the five catch‐related clusters. We found that the Rooted Rural Tapestry, located outside urban areas, was significantly more likely to be associated with catfish anglers whose answers suggested that they had higher trophy motivation compared to the other angler clusters. We also found that anglers in the urban areas were more likely to have a variety of motivations. The Southwestern Families Tapestry was identified as an underserved group exhibiting high growth potential and should be considered for targeted R3 efforts using insight gathered from that tapestry on its preferred media channels. We plotted areas with high populations and proportions of individual tapestries that were the greatest in discriminating among the catch‐related angler clusters. Our ESRI predictive maps for 2024 showed areas throughout Texas where managers could focus different R3 advertising and catfish management strategies based on the underlying customer segments.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/nafm.10538",""

Each PE teacher leadership style implies a critical meaning of how a class reaches its goals and objectives effectively. Transformational leadership initially was proposed by Burns (1978). Daft (2008) defined transformational leadership as “characterized by the ability to bring about significant change in followers and the organization” (p. 356). The expectancy value theory focuses on two critical aspects: an expectation of being successful in a current or distant task and the value placed on having a value for doing the task. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of PE teachers’ transformational leadership on middle school students’ expectancy-value. Transformational teaching questionnaire (Beauchamp et al., 2010) and expectancy-value questionnaire (Duncan & Tammen, 1989) were employed for this study; a total of 16 items were used. The participants included 295 middle school students from three private middle schools located in the southwestern area in the USA and 262 questionnaires were used for the data analyses. Collected data were analyzed by descriptive, exploratory factor analysis and regression using the SPSS 25.

Based on multiple regression, intellectual stimulation was a common factor that affected students’ expectancy-value positively. The results of the study support the importance of transformational leadership which used a means of enhancing middle school students’ expectancy-value in PE. Moreover, this study indicated that transformational leadership facilitates teaching and students’ learning in PE. Thus, it is recommended that PE teachers be able to understand and display appropriate leadership, in particular transformational leadership.","",""

We investigate how trends in short sleep duration are influenced by changes in population aging, socioeconomic factors (e.g., education, labor force participation, marital status), and health conditions and behaviors (e.g., pain, smoking, drinking, obesity, psychological distress). We use the pooled cross-sectional data from the 2004-2018 National Health and Interview Survey, a large and nationally representative study. We partition overall trends in short sleep duration into (a) compositional effects due to distributional changes in age structure, socioeconomic and health factors and (b) unexplained rate effects. Subsequently, we compare the relative contribution of each factor to the total compositional effects among Black and White participants. Results demonstrate that greater education is associated with greater prevalence of short sleep duration among Black Americans, but reduced prevalence among White Americans. For both racial groups, population aging contributes relatively little to temporal patterns in short sleep duration; by contrast, higher distress and lower labor force participation in recent years are associated with the increasing prevalence of short sleep duration.","https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/5/Supplement_1/909/43189151/igab046.3298.pdf",""

However, such an infill scheme in the field practice still heavily relies on empirical knowledge or pressure responses, and the geomechanics consequences have not been fully understood. Backed by the data set from the Permian Basin, in this work we present a novel integrated reservoir-geomechanics-fracture model to simulate the spatiotemporal stress evolution and locate the optimal development strategy in the upside target of the Bone Spring Formation. An embedded discrete fracture model (EDFM) is deployed in our fluid-flow simulation to characterize complex fractures, and the stress-dependent matrix permeability and fracture conductivity are included through the compaction/dilation option. After calibrating reservoir and fracture properties by history matching of an actual well in the development target (i.e., third Bone Spring), we run the finite element method (FEM)-based geomechanics simulation to model the 3D stress state evolution. Then a displacement discontinuity method (DDM) hydraulic fracture model is applied to simulate the multicluster fracture propagation under an updated heterogeneous stress field in the upside target (i.e., second Bone Spring). Numerical results indicate that stress field redistribution associated with parent-well production indeed vertically propagates to the upside target. The extent of stress reorientation at the infill location mainly depends on the parent-child horizontal offset, whereas the stress depletion is under the combined impact of horizontal offset, vertical offset, and infill time. A smaller parent-child horizontal offset aggravates the overlap of the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV), resulting in more substantial interwell interference and less desirable oil and gas production. The same trend is observed by varying the parent-child vertical offset. Moreover, the efficacy of an infill operation at an earlier time is less affected by parent-well depletion because of the less-disturbed stress state. The candidate infill-well locations at various infill timings are suggested based on the parent-well and child-well production cosimulation. Being able to incorporate both pressure and stress responses, the reservoir-geomechanics-fracture model delivers a more comprehensive understanding and a more integral solution of infill-well design in multilayer unconventional reservoirs. The conclusions provide practical guidelines for the subsequent development in the Permian Basin.","http://onepetro.org/REE/article-pdf/24/03/570/2475151/spe-205476-pa.pdf",""

While protective factors are a useful concept for understanding suicide protection, they address only moderators of risks for suicidal behavior instead of how people effectively cope with risks and stress (Werner 2000). More recently, researchers have begun studying resilience to suicide to ascertain how people cope and thrive in the face of adverse situations. We analyzed Black women’s social resilience to suicide. After analyzing 33 interviews with African American women, we found that they employ a repertoire of resilience that is made up of interrelated scripts that value Black women’s (1) shared experiences of struggle, (2) centuries of strength building, and (3) the counter-evaluation of privilege. We argue that by counter-framing marginalizing experiences of poverty, discrimination, and low social status, this cultural repertoire provides Black women with an empowering self-conceptualization that fosters their resistance to suicide.","https://academic.oup.com/socpro/article-pdf/70/3/650/50878145/spab072.pdf",""

The simulation is conducted using the unsteady compressible inviscid flow solver, which is implemented in OpenFOAM®, the open-source CFD tool. Further, the wedge motion is applied by moving the mesh boundary, performing the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) technique. In addition, the sonic and the detachment criteria are used to define the dynamic transition from RR to MR during the increase of the wedge angle. Different reduced frequencies, κ, in the range of [0.1–2] for the moving wedge are applied to study the lag in the dynamic transition from the steady-state condition. The results show that the critical value of κ = 0.4 distinguishes between the rapid and gradual lag in the transition from RR to MR. In addition, the transition from RR to MR occurs above the Dual Solution Domain (DSD), since the shock is curved downstream during the rapid motion of the wedge.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2021-69625/6827324/v004t04a006-imece2021-69625.pdf",""

Responses to the four diets were similar (~12% decrease in % LDL4, p = 0.890) in the lower (<2.73 median) HOMA-IR subgroup but differed across diet conditions in the higher HOMA-IR subgroup (p = 0.013), in which % LDL4 was reduced with BOLD+ (−11%), was unchanged in BOLD and increased with the HAD (8%) and DASH (6%) diets (p < 0.05 for BOLD+ vs. HAD). Individual responses to diet interventions are influenced by presence and degree of insulin resistance as measured by HOMA-IR.","https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/12/4328/pdf",""

Calves born following various reproductive treatments (synchronized natural service and synchronized AI) in 10 herds over 2 years were fed to reach a target backfat (BF) of 1.27 cm, sent to harvest, and carcass data collected. Calves were classified into calving groups as natural service born early (NS-Early, n = 189), natural service born late (NS-Late, n = 203), or AI sired born early (AI-Early, n = 116). Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure in SAS with calving group, year and calf gender in the model. Weaning weights were similar between AI-Early and NS-Early; however, earlier born calves (AI-Early and NS-Early) were heavier (P &lt; 0.0001) than NS-Late. AI-Early calves had heavier finished bodyweight (622.2 kg: P = 0.0024) compared to NS-Early (601.4 kg) and heavier HCW compared to both NS-Early and NS-Late (P &lt; 0.01). NS-Early calves reached 1.27 cm BF in fewer days than AI-Early (261 d and 275 d, respectively; P &lt; 0.01) with NS-late requiring the most days on feed to reach the same endpoint (296 d, P &lt; 0.01). No differences in Quality Grade, Yield Grade, REA, marbling, or BF were detected between AI-Early, NS-Early, and NS-Late, or between early- and late-born calves (P &gt; 0.38). Late-born calves required 29 more days on feed (P &lt; 0.001) to reach 1.27 cm BF resulting in greater final bodyweight compared to early-born calves (625.5 kg and 612.8 kg, respectively; P = 0.04); however, hot carcass weights were similar between early- and late-born calves. Reproductive technologies that increase the number of calves born early in the calving season increased weaning weight and post weaning growth performance, but compared to high quality natural service sires, AI did not improve carcass characteristics.","http://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/99/Supplement_3/433/40568178/skab235.776.pdf",""

We describe SROs’ perceptions of the quality and content of the training, need for the training, and the self-reported impact of training on officers’ daily job activities. Based on the largely positive responses and comments from over 400 SROs, we provide recommendations for policy makers considering similar specialized training for SROs.","https://academic.oup.com/policing/article-pdf/15/4/2283/42262246/paab049.pdf",""

This market has risen to dizzying heights fueled by social media and collaborations with celebrities and designers which, coupled with limited availablility of merchandise, have generated great consumer demand and interest surrounding this market. The aim of this study was to investigate popular culture and social media and their influence on fashion conscious consumers interested in secondary sneaker retailers (i.e., StockX, GOAT) as well as their further impact on purchase intentions. The authors utilized the theory of reasoned action (TRA) to examine consumer behavior toward secondary sneaker retailers. The findings support the TRA, suggesting that the social mechanisms of interest (i.e., popular culture and social media) positively influence consumers, who report high levels of fashion consciousness and subsequent positive attitudes toward the secondary sneaker retailer, subjective norms, and ultimately purchase behavior vis‐a‐vis secondary sneakers. The findings of this study will enable industry practitioners and members of academia to gain a deeper understanding of this phenomenon.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ijcs.12725",""

A four-stage, multiple linear hierarchical regression model and two multiple mediation bootstrap analyses were employed. Race-related stress and racial identity attitudes significantly and uniquely predicted involvement in African American activism, complementing existing literature. Beyond that, social justice beliefs predicted African American activism over and above racial identity and race-related stress. More specifically, social justice subjective norms (i.e., social influence) was the most important predictor of activism for African American undergraduates.

Industrial byproducts can be repurposed for livestock diets to decrease these costs. Therefore, finding alternative feedstuffs may benefit the economics of livestock production. The goal of this project was to evaluate the variation in nutritive value of ruminal waste as a potential feedstuff. Twelve paunch samples were collected from individual cattle across multiple harvest dates at the Tarleton State University Meat Laboratory, Stephenville, TX. Samples were dried and assayed for dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), sequential neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and acid detergent lignin (ADL), and physically-effective fiber (peNDF). Samples were subjected to batch-culture in vitro digestibility assays for the determination of digestibility coefficients. Mean NDF, ADF, ADL, CP and peNDF concentrations were 681, 399, 109, 150, and 387 g kg−1 DM, respectively. Contribution to variance from sample for NDF, ADF, ADL, CP, and peNDF were 75.3, 41.9, 33.0, 51.2, and 71.3%, respectively.

Results indicate that rumen waste harvested from abattoirs may be useful for sustainable livestock production, while reducing environmental threats posed by disposal, but the viability of the product is highly dependent on the source animal. For full viability of application in a sustainable system, a centralized receiving and compositing system may be useful for developing a consistent product.","https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/11/12/3573/pdf",""

Agriculture is responsible for mass deforestation. The world is facing a water crisis, and farming is responsible for using 80% of its freshwater. Also, the prospect of global climate change is projecting a much riskier future for practices of conventional farming. One could argue that these alarming problems might someday be treated as more imminent as the population grows, less fertile land becomes available, and the effects of global climate change become more apparent. Vertical farming solves a lot of the mentioned issues associated with traditional farming by using considerably less water, requiring less land, and not relying on the environmental conditions whatsoever. However, vertical farming is also energy and labor intensive and can be quite expensive in some cases. This study works to quantitatively model and evaluate the economic prospect of vertical farming as a business venture in a competitive marketplace under different circumstances. A generalized quantitative framework to evaluate vertical farming with respect to traditional farming is developed. Then, the developed framework is employed for a case study to evaluate the merits of vertical farming in several locations around the US by measuring the relative profit and risk. The results quantify the value proposition of the practice in various conditions and help evaluate the current and future prospect the vertical farming industry.","https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-943119/v1",""

Element:Ca chronologies were developed for otolith Li:Ca, Mg:Ca, Mn:Ca, Zn:Ca, Sr:Ca, and Ba:Ca, and our assessment focused on the section of the otolith corresponding to the juvenile period (age-0 to age-1+). Next, we applied a common time-series approach (i.e., changepoint analysis) to geochemical profiles to identify divergences presumably linked to inshore-offshore migrations. Conspicuous geochemical shifts were detected during the juvenile interval for Mg:Ca, Mn:Ca, and Sr:Ca that were indicative of coastal-offshore transitions or egress generally occurring for individuals approximately 4-6 mo. old, with later departures (6 mo. or older) linked to overwintering being more limited. Changepoints in ototith Ba:Ca profiles were most common in the early age-1 period (ca. 12-16 mo.) and appear associated with entry into upwelling areas such as the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem following trans-Pacific migrations. Natal origin of PBT was also predicted using the early life portion of geochemical profile in relation to a baseline sample comprised of age-0 PBT from the two primary spawning areas in the East China Sea and Sea of Japan. Mixed-stock analysis indicated that the majority of adult PBT in our sample originated from the East China Sea, but individuals of Sea of Japan origin were also detected our sample of spawning adults collected in the Ryukyu Archipelago.","https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-199680/v1",""

The relatively higher levels of androgen exposure in the male fetus are thought to cause this difference. Postnatally, the onset of puberty is also associated with the androgen surge in males. In this study, we investigated sexual dimorphism in age-related changes in stimulus-frequency otoacoustic emissions for children. Design:: In a retrospective design, stimulus-frequency otoacoustic emissions were analyzed from a cross-sectional sample of 170 normal-hearing children (4 to 12 years) and 67 young adults. Wideband acoustic immittance and efferent inhibition measures were analyzed to determine the extent to which middle ear transmission and efferent inhibition can account for potential sex differences in stimulus-frequency otoacoustic emissions. Results:: Male children showed a significant reduction in otoacoustic emission magnitudes with age, whereas female children did not show any such changes. Females showed higher stimulus-frequency otoacoustic emission magnitudes compared with males. However, the effect size of sex differences in young adults was larger compared with children. Unlike the otoacoustic emission magnitude, the noise floor did not show sexual dimorphism; however, it decreased with age. Neither the wideband absorbance nor efferent inhibition could account for the sex differences in stimulus-frequency otoacoustic emissions. Conclusions:: The cochlear-amplifier function remains robust in female children but diminishes in male children between 4 and 12 years of age. We carefully eliminated lifestyle, middle ear, and efferent factors to conclude that the androgen surge associated with puberty likely caused the observed masculinization of stimulus-frequency otoacoustic emissions in male children. These findings have significant theoretical consequences. The cochlea is considered mature at birth; however, the present findings highlight that functional cochlear maturation, as revealed by otoacoustic emissions, can be postnatally influenced by endogenous hormonal factors, at least in male children. Overall, work reported here demonstrates sexual dimorphism in the functional cochlear maturational processes during childhood.","https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/AUD.0000000000000976",""

Due to harvest facility slowdowns and shutdowns, many market animals, including beef cattle, were on feed greater than 60 d past their optimal endpoint. These dramatic changes caused many changes in feeding and growth technologies management. The two major growth enhancing compounds used in feedlot cattle production are steroidal implants (IMP) and β-adrenergic agonists (β-AA). Implementation of β-AA during the pandemic was extremely difficult due to the lack of knowledge on exact shipping dates. The β-AA are fed the last 28 to 42 d on feed. Ractopamine was approved for cattle with essential a 12-h withdrawal. Many questions arose about the maximum length of withdrawal on ractopamine before losing any of the added growth response in both the live animal and carcass. Many feedlot operators relied on IMP administration to achieve added growth response in cattle held for longer days on feed. With zero-day withdrawal on implants, it was a cost-effective means to hold cattle in an efficient manner. Many producers simply could not manage β-AA feeding during the pandemic period and used other management technologies to enhance growth and efficiency during the end of the feeding period.","http://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/99/Supplement_1/38/37890298/skab054.066.pdf",""

To mitigate these differences, the radar-simulator Quickbeam within the Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project (CFMIP) Observation Simulator Package (COSP) simulates reflectivity from model variables at the subgrid scale. This work adapts Quickbeam to the dual-frequency precipitation radar (DPR) on board the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite. The longer wavelength of the DPR is used to evaluate moderate to heavy precipitation in GCMs, which is missed when Quickbeam is used as a cloud radar simulator. Latitudinal and land–ocean comparisons are made between COSP output from the Community Atmospheric Model version 5 (CAM5) and DPR data. Additionally, this work improves the COSP subgrid algorithm by applying a more realistic, nondeterministic approach to assigning GCM gridbox convective cloud cover when convective cloud is not provided as a model output. Instead of assuming a static 5% convective cloud coverage, DPR convective precipitation coverage is used as a proxy for convective cloud coverage. For example, DPR observations show that convective rain typically only covers about 1% of a 2° grid box, but that the median convective rain area increases to over 10% in heavy rain cases. In our CAM5 tests, the updated subgrid algorithm improved the comparison between reflectivity distributions when the convective cloud cover is provided versus the default 5% convective cloud-cover assumption.","https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atot/38/9/JTECH-D-20-0089.1.xml",""

A learner agent seeks to mimic another expert agent's state and control input behavior trajectories by observing the expert's behavior trajectories. These observations are used to reconstruct the unknown expert's performance objective. This article develops novel inverse RL algorithms to solve the inverse RL problem in which both agents suffer from adversarial attacks and have continuous‐time nonlinear dynamics. We first propose an offline inverse RL algorithm for the learner to reconstruct unknown expert's performance objective. This offline inverse RL algorithm is based on the technique of integral RL (IRL) and only needs partial knowledge of the system dynamics. The algorithm has two learning stages: an optimal control learning stage first and a second learning stage based on inverse optimal control. Then, based on the offline algorithm, an online inverse RL algorithm is further developed to solve the inverse RL problem in real time without knowing the system drift dynamics. This online adaptive learning method consists of simultaneous adaptation of four neural networks (NNs): a critic NN, an actor NN, an adversary NN, and a state penalty NN. Convergence of the algorithms as well as the stability of the learner system and the synchronous tuning NNs are guaranteed.

Consequently, exploring alternative treatment methods for chronic pain is essential. Noninvasive brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are increasingly being investigated for their neuropharmacological effects in the treatment of chronic pain. This review aims to examine and evaluate the present state of evidence regarding the use of tDCS and TMS in the treatment of chronic pain. Recent findings: Despite conflicting evidence in the early literature, evidence from recent rigorous research supports the use of tDCS and TMS in treating chronic pain conditions. For both tDCS and TMS, standardized stimulation parameters have been identified with the recommendation for repeated maintenance stimulation to ensure that the analgesic effect is sustained beyond discontinuation of therapy. Summary: Due to a lack of defined stimulation protocols, early findings on the efficacy of tDCS and TMS are mixed. Although the application of tDCS and TMS as pain relief approaches is still in its early stages, the introduction of standardized stimulation protocols is paving the way for more robust and informed research.","https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/ACO.0000000000001056",""

Past research is ambiguous regarding the degree to which shoppers try to simplify this information integration process. Some results suggest that customers will invest a substantial amount of time and effort into the decision process, while others suggest that customers prefer to keep the process as simple as possible and avoid extra effort. In the present study, we sought to examine the conditions under which people will use heuristic strategies versus more analytic ones. We found that the average user rating plays a large role in determining which strategy customers use to integrate product information into a purchasing decision. We show that people use a “binary bias”—assessing the relative number of “high” and “low” ratings and choosing items with the more favorable ratio—when products have a lackluster (~three‐star) average user rating. However, when average ratings are higher, customers instead use even simpler cues to make decisions. We also found evidence that individual differences in analytical thinking dispositions are associated with using more effortful information integration strategies. Thus, the present research suggests different strategies for displaying product information to customers depending on the average user ratings of the product and characteristics of the shoppers themselves.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/cb.1995",""

Experimental Design:: Therapeutic efficacy of the combination was assessed in platinum-resistant human and murine ovarian cancer peritoneal metastatic mouse models (n = 9–10/group). RNA sequencing along with flow cytometry of splenocytes from treated mice was employed to examine the effect of antitumor immune response (n = 3/group). Anti-PD-1 antibody was performed to evaluate impact on checkpoint inhibition in vivo. Results:: Gene Ontology pathway analysis uncovered disruption of cellular extracellular vesicle (EV)-related pathways in infected cells (FDR = 2.97E-57). Mechanistically, we identified reduced expression of transporters expressed on EV implicated in cisplatin efflux. The increased cisplatin retention led to increased cisplatin–DNA adducts, which resulted in micronuclei and the subsequent activation of cGAS–STING pathway with a significant activation of innate immune cells and translated to an increase in antitumor immunity and efficacy. In mice bearing platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, we also observed a feedback induction of PD-L1 on tumor cells, which sensitized combination-treated mice to anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint therapy. Conclusions:: To our knowledge, this is the first report to show HSV-induced cisplatin retention in infected cells. The consequential increased damaged DNA was then expelled from cells as micronuclei which resulted in induction of inflammatory responses and education of antitumor immunity. The combination therapy also created an environment that sensitized tumors to immune checkpoint therapy.","https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article-pdf/27/2/542/2068698/542.pdf",""

Materials and Methods: A multi‐institutional retrospective case series was performed to identify dogs with a gall bladder mucocele between 2004 and 2018 that underwent a cholecystectomy. Dogs were classified into nonelective or elective based on the presence or absence, respectively, of gall bladder rupture, biliary duct distension, clinical signs or hyperbilirubinemia. Each cholecystectomy was classified into three groups: duodenotomy and retrograde catheterisation, normograde catheterisation or no catheterisation. Complications were divided into four grades based on increasing severity and mortality rates were assessed for each. Results: The mortality rate was 2 (6%) out of 31 for dogs undergoing an elective cholecystectomy and 21 (23%) out of 90 for dogs undergoing a nonelective cholecystectomy.

New objective methods that optimize spectacle corrections for this population may reduce limitations on daily living by improving visual quality. PURPOSE: This article describes the methods and baseline characteristics of study participants in a National Eye Institute–sponsored clinical trial to evaluate objectively derived spectacle corrections in adults with Down syndrome. Intersession repeatability of the primary outcome measure (distance visual acuity) is also reported. METHODS: Adults with Down syndrome were enrolled into a nine-visit study to compare clinically derived spectacle corrections and two different objective spectacle corrections derived from wavefront aberration data. Spectacle corrections were randomized and dispensed for 2 months each. Distance visual acuity was measured with a Bailey-Lovie–style chart. Intersession repeatability of acuity was established by performing difference versus mean analysis from binocular acuity measures obtained through habitual corrections at visits 1 and 2. RESULTS: Thirty adults (mean ± standard deviation age, 29 ± 10 years) with a large range of refractive errors were enrolled. Presenting visual acuity at visit 1 was reduced (right eye, 0.47 ± 0.20 logMAR; left eye, 0.42 ± 0.17 logMAR). The mean difference between visits 1 and 2 was 0.02 ± 0.06 logMAR, with a coefficient of repeatability (1.96 × within-subject standard deviation) of 0.12 logMAR. CONCLUSIONS: This study seeks to investigate new strategies to determine optical corrections that may reduce commonly observed visual deficits in individuals with Down syndrome. The good intersession repeatability of acuity found in this study (six letters) indicates that, despite the presence of reduced acuity, adults with Down syndrome performed the outcome measure for this clinical trial reliably.","https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/OPX.0000000000001631",""

We hypothesized that integrative behavior mediated the relationship between dyad personal characteristics and negotiation outcomes after controlling for negotiation skill. Data were collected from 134 MBA dyads. We found that dyad integrative behavior predicted arriving at a negotiated agreement, satisfaction with outcomes and the creativity, practicality, and quality of agreements. Integrative behavior mediated the relationship between dyad personal characteristics (homogeneity in gender, country of origin, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and competing preference) and some negotiation outcomes. In conclusion, as a social exchange, negotiation is largely successful to the extent that negotiators demonstrate behavior that is fair, straightforward and rational. The study contributes to the evidence of the predictive power of dyad integrative behavior on negotiation outcomes.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/crq.21332",""

Where knowledge gaps exist, we propose potential research to elucidate health, environmental, policy, and economic impacts of the extreme weather event. We expect that recommendations made here — while specific to the situation and outcomes of Winter Storm Uri — will increase Texas’ resilience to other extreme weather events not discussed in this paper. We found that out of 14 million residents who were on boil water notices, those who were served by very small water systems went, on average, a minimum of three days longer without potable water. Available county-level data do not indicate vulnerable communities went longer periods of time without power or water during the event. More resolved data are required to understand who was most heavily impacted at the community or neighborhood level. Gaps in government communication, response, and policy are discussed, including issues with identifying — and securing power to — critical infrastructure and the fact that the state’s Emergency Alert System was not used consistently to update Texans during the crisis. Finally, research recommendations are made to bolster weaknesses discovered during and after the storm including (1) reliable communication strategies, (2) reducing disproportionate impacts to vulnerable communities, (3) human health impacts, (4) increasing water infrastructure resilience, and (5) how climate change could impact infrastructure resilience into the future.","https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S2345737621500226",""

As the intermediary between mother and fetus, the placenta has the potential to interpret environmental signals, such as nutrient availability, and adapt to support fetal growth and development. While this potential is present, it is clear that at times placental adaptation fails to occur resulting in poor pregnancy outcomes. This review will focus on placental responses to maternal undernutrition related to changes in placental vascularization and hemodynamics and placental nutrient transport systems across species. While much of the available literature describes placental responses that result in poor fetal outcomes, novel models have been developed to utilize the inherent variation in fetal weight when dams are nutrient restricted to identify placental adaptations that result in normal-weight offspring. Detailed analyses of the spectrum of placental responses to maternal malnutrition point to alternations in placental histoarchitectural and vascular development, amino acid and lipid transport mechanisms, and modulation of immune-related factors. Dietary supplementation with selected nutrients, such as arginine, has the potential to improve placental growth and function through a variety of mechanisms including stimulating cell proliferation, protein synthesis, angiogenesis, vasodilation, and gene regulation. Improved understanding of placental responses to environmental cues is necessary to develop diagnostic and intervention strategies to improve pregnancy outcomes.","https://rep.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/rep/162/4/REP-21-0179.xml",""

Background: Parents tend to report worse health than nonparents due to elevated stress associated with parenting. However, most existing scholarship de facto examines parental status and health among cisgender heterosexual adults. Little research has employed an intersectional approach to focus on parenthood and health differences within sexual minority adults across varying gender identities. Method: Ordinary least squares (OLS) and logistic regression models were used to analyze data from the 2010 Social Justice Sexuality Project ( Results: In a sample composed predominantly of people of color, parenthood status is related to both mental well‐being and smoking status among gay and lesbian adults, but this relationship is inconsistent across cisgender and transgender groups. OLS regression models show that parenthood is positively related to mental well‐being among gay and lesbian transgender people, whereas logistic regression results find that parenthood is associated with higher odds of smoking among cisgender gay men. Conclusion: These findings suggest that among a sample of sexual and gender minorities composed mostly of people of color, parenthood status is connected with the health and well‐being of gay and lesbian adults in ways that depend on gender identity.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jomf.12778",""

Using data from GPCM, FTM, and RTM, we examine performance of the scoring models in multiple aspects: relative model fit, absolute item fit, significance of testlet effects, parameter recovery, and classification accuracy. The empirical analysis suggests that relative performance of the models varies substantially depending on the testlet-effect type, effect size, and trait estimator. When testlets had no or fixed effects, GPCM and FTM led to most desirable measurement outcomes. When testlets had random interaction effects, RTM demonstrated best model fit and yet showed substantially different performance in the trait recovery depending on the estimator. In particular, the advantage of RTM as a scoring model was discernable only when there existed strong random effects and the trait levels were estimated with Bayes priors. In other settings, the simpler models (i.e., GPCM, FTM) performed better or comparably. The study also revealed that polytomous scoring of testlet items has limited prospect as a functional scoring method.

Recent advances have incorporated quantitative data as an asymmetric encryption key. With this method, the sender and receiver each run the same experiment to encode and decode the message of interest. Experimental asymmetric keys can come from DNA, enzymatic assays, and most recently, electrochemical data. This manuscript summarizes recent advances in cryptography and outlines new electrochemical techniques.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/elsa.202100188",""

Nevertheless, some nations in the Region are lagging and need to reform their E-commerce laws to participate fully in the growth trend. They can look to the Jamaican and Puerto Rican statutes as models to emulate. Jamaica’s Electronic Transactions Act (ETA) contains a third-generation E-signature law; all types of E-signatures are accepted, but a preference is given to the digital signature. The most distinguished sections of the ETA are the comprehensive provisions relating to the use of the electronic form to satisfy statutory requirements; legal liability of Certification Service Providers, subscribers, and relying on third parties; and the provisions relating to the effect of an error or omission occurring during an E-commerce communiqué. Despite these positive aspects, the ETA does need to be fine-tuned. Puerto Rico’s E-Government Act (EGA) is exemplary because it: mandates the implementation of a comprehensive list of E-government services at the Government Portal; assigns one government agency the responsibility of implementation of E-government and gives it broad powers to achieve that goal; and establishes a long list of specific government services that government departments are required to provide citizens. This article makes recommendations for amendment of the ETA and presents the amended Jamaican ETA and the Puerto Rican EGA as paradigms for other Caribbean nations to follow.","",""

Full-night polysomnography is considered the gold standard for OSA diagnosis. However, it is time-consuming, expensive and is not readily available in many parts of the world. Many screening questionnaires and scores have been proposed for OSA prediction with high sensitivity and low specificity. The present study is intended to develop models with various machine learning techniques to predict the severity of OSA by incorporating features from multiple questionnaires. Methods: Subjects who underwent full-night polysomnography in Torr sleep center, Texas and completed 5 OSA screening questionnaires/scores were included. OSA was diagnosed by using Apnea-Hypopnea Index ≥ 5. We trained five different machine learning models including Deep Neural Networks with the scaled principal component analysis (DNN-PCA), Random Forest (RF), Adaptive Boosting classifier (ABC), and K-Nearest Neighbors classifier (KNC) and Support Vector Machine Classifier (SVMC). Training:Testing subject ratio of 65:35 was used. All features including demographic data, body measurement, snoring and sleepiness history were obtained from 5 OSA screening questionnaires/scores (STOP-BANG questionnaires, Berlin questionnaires, NoSAS score, NAMES score and No-Apnea score). Performance parametrics were used to compare between machine learning models. Results: Of 180 subjects, 51.5 % of subjects were male with mean (SD) age of 53.6 (15.1). One hundred and nineteen subjects were diagnosed with OSA. Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of DNN-PCA, RF, ABC, KNC, SVMC, STOP-BANG questionnaire, Berlin questionnaire, NoSAS score, NAMES score, and No-Apnea score were 0.85, 0.68, 0.52, 0.74, 0.75, 0.61, 0.63, 0,61, 0.58 and 0,58 respectively. DNN-PCA showed the highest AUROC with sensitivity of 0.79, specificity of 0.67, positive-predictivity of 0.93, F1 score of 0.86, and accuracy of 0.77. Conclusion: Our result showed that DNN-PCA outperforms OSA screening questionnaires, scores and other machine learning models.","http://academic.oup.com/sleep/article-pdf/44/Supplement_2/A164/37656197/zsab072.413.pdf",""

This online self-presentation constitutes a narrative that can be examined as a shared account. In this study, we tested the applicability of Duck’s model of relational dissolution (Duck, 1982; Rollie & Duck, 2006) to participants’ personal and public accounts of their romantic breakups on social networking sites (also referred to as social network sites). We adopted mixed methods (content analysis, survey, and interview) to examine emerging adults’ ( N = 97) account-making during romantic relationship dissolution and the role of social media, specifically Facebook, in the process. Over 3500 posts and comments from before and after users’ breakups were quantitatively and qualitatively content analyzed. Synthesizing these three data sources revealed patterns regarding users’ selective self-presentation in masspersonal channels. Their dissolution accounts were shaped by perceptions of Facebook’s social affordances, such as the visibility and persistence of posts, comments, and relational artifacts; social feedback (e.g., comments and “likes” from the online social network, usually for social support); conversational control (e.g., blocking and defriending); and network association, which created a diverse imagined audience and context collapse. Findings suggest that some of Duck’s relational dissolution model manifests on social media, particularly social, gravedressing, and resurrection processes. Users consider and capitalize on perceived affordances of computer-mediated communication channels to construct, curate, or avoid public accounts of their breakups. Our study also provides a methodological framework for investigating user experiences and selective self-presentation on social media over time synthesizing quantitative and qualitative methods.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/02654075211052247",""

One should not presume that allyship conceptually permeates all social justice movements. One should not presume that allyships develop to combat or dismantle a predefined socially constructed ism. A critical interrogation of allyship and allyship constructions necessitates recognition of broader, universal tenets of allyships anywhere. This must go further to embrace the nuanced, situated, dynamic, critically problematic, and complex dimensions rooted in individual lived experiences intersecting multiple marginalizations which contribute as praxis toward an actualizing of individual allyships. Although we will blur constructed distinctions as we progress, here, we endeavor to surface and deliberate upon the derivations and functions and shapes of allyships between two demographic categories, made arbitrarily distinct here for the purposes of engaging in discursive analysis: cisgender heterosexual Black women and cisgender gay White men. In short, we are proposing a way to view this allyship as bidirectional allyships, grounded in social justice frames of existing: a way to see each respective group as traveling within their own lane down a collectively traveled highway.

We also present empirical evidence that, in contrast to the practice in most manufacturing industries, smaller craft breweries pay more for higher quality inputs and charge higher prices. The model is simulated to analyze three counterfactual scenarios: the taste renaissance by expanding consumers' (i) taste for variety and (ii) preference for unique quality beer and (iii) the 2017 tax reform. The taste renaissance scenarios have similar directional effects on the monopolistic segment, but the impacts of an increase in the love‐of‐variety are much stronger than those of an increase in quality. In all three scenarios, the craft segment expands and the macrosegment contracts, but industry‐level sales rise and the aggregate price index declines, benefiting consumers.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ecin.12996",""

Addressing biogeochemical changes and resource limitations may help improve restoration efforts within this difficult-to-restore biome. In the present article, we present a synthesis of restoration literature that identifies multiple ways biogeochemical understandings might augment dryland restoration outcomes, including timing restoration around resource cycling and uptake, connecting heterogeneous landscapes, manipulating resource pools, and using organismal functional traits to a restoration advantage. We conclude by suggesting ways to incorporate biogeochemistry into existing restoration frameworks and discuss research directions that may help improve restoration outcomes in the world's highly altered dryland landscapes.","https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article-pdf/71/9/907/40080442/biab043.pdf",""

Previous research has demonstrated an association between neighborhood environments and cognitive function in older adults. However, most studies were cross-sectional, focused on western countries, and did not examine potential moderating factors. This study examined gender and age variations in the relationship between neighborhood environments and cognitive decline in middle and old age in a developing country that is experiencing rapid population aging and rising prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. Using data from a nationally representative sample of adults aged 45 years and older from the three waves of China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS 2011-2015), this study estimated multilevel growth curve models for the effects of neighborhood environments on cognitive decline separately for men and women and for those aged 45 to 64 and those aged 65 and above. It showed that the cross-sectional effect of outdoor facility and longitudinal effect of handicapped access were more significant for men, but the cross-sectional effect of community social participation and longitudinal effects of raining days, number of disasters, employment service, and community SES were more significant for women. The cross-sectional effect of infrastructure advantages and longitudinal effects of employment service and old age income support were more significant for adults aged 65 and over. These findings suggest that community-level interventions may be more beneficial for older women.","https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/5/Supplement_1/245/43180867/igab046.946.pdf",""

To achieve this objective, we utilize 2006–2015 county‐level longitudinal data with information on cover crop adoption and crop insurance participation for the State of Indiana. Cover crop adoption information is collected from a remote sensing (satellite‐based) data set of soil health practices. Linear fixed effect (FE) models and instrumental variable FE models are used in the empirical analysis to take advantage of the panel nature of the data and address potential endogeneity issues. Our results suggest that while crop insurance coverage may play a role in “disincentivizing” cover crop use, it is likely not a major driver in the cover crop adoption decision (i.e., the magnitude of the effect is small). Therefore, further research and policy attention toward other potential mechanisms that can likely have a larger impact on cover crop uptake may be a better approach (e.g., enhanced outreach programs and/or additional targeted conservation payments).","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/aepp.13206",""

A growing body of literature has linked the constructs of the triarchic model of psychopathy (boldness, meanness, disinhibition) to the FFM. Recently, researchers developed both item and regression-based measures of the triarchic model of psychopathy using the NEO Personality Inventory–Revised—a popular measure of the FFM. The current study examines the correlates of these two FFM-derived operationalizations of the triarchic model using data from the Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study. The two approaches had strong convergent validity coefficients and similar patterns of criterion-related validity coefficients. Meanness related to greater personality pathology characterized by exploitation of others and poor attachment, whereas disinhibition related to indicators of greater negative affect and poor behavioral constraint. Boldness related to reduced negative affect and greater narcissistic personality traits. Although the item and regression-based approaches showed similar patterns of associations with criterion-variables, the item-based approach has some practical and psychometric advantages over the regression-based approach given strong correlations between the meanness and disinhibition scores from the regression approach.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/10731911211006186",""

This study identifies specific types and frequencies of two basic disaster-related unmet needs—housing and food—and spatially analyzes these by location to determine vulnerable communities during Texas’ spring 2015 floods. The Texas 2-1-1 Network provided a database of disaster-related callers’ locations and needs recorded statewide per day, May–June 2015. Disaster-related unmet needs (N = 4,880) for housing (24%) and food (8%) were analyzed by location to determine vulnerable communities during these record-breaking floods throughout Texas. Mapping of unmet need volume per county differed from hotspot locations adjusted by population size to control for urban bias. Volume of housing and food unmet needs were higher in flooded metropolitan counties of east- and central-Texas. After adjusting for population size, Houston remained a hotspot for housing and food unmet needs but many rural counties were shown to be highly vulnerable as well. The spatial analysis helps to target resource allocations to disaster-affected communities more equitably and effectively based on the type of unmet needs and location of access barriers in real-time during disasters. This enables a greater understanding of variations in allocating resources to enhance the resiliency of vulnerable populations.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/028072702103900303",""

PubMed Medline, CINAHL, and PsychINFO were systematically searched through July 2020. Two independent investigators screened citations to identify studies to increase PA in adults residing in rural areas who had received any cancer diagnosis. Meta-analyses were conducted to assess proportion of participants achieving PA goal, paired mean difference (MD) in aerobic PA and strength training, and retention from baseline to post-intervention. Seven studies met inclusion criteria encompassing a total of 722 participants (591 in intervention and 131 controls). Overall quality of evidence was low to medium. The pooled proportion of participants achieving PA goals (150–225 min/wk) was 39% [95% confidence interval (CI), 18%–62%]. The mean time spent engaging in aerobic PA increased from baseline to post-intervention (range, 6–52 weeks) by 97.7 min/wk (95% CI, 75.0–120.4), and the MD in time spent on strength training was 12.2 min/wk (95% CI, −8.3–32.8).

Common damages of coke drums known as bulging and cracking are associated with accumulative plasticity caused by thermal and mechanical strains. External repairs using temper-bead welding techniques are implemented to repair welds in the damaged areas of coke drums, which provide structural support to the vessels. Compared with matching filler metals, Ni-base fillers including alloy 625 and alloy 182 are compatible with both low-alloy steel base metal and internal clads in terms of weldability and thermal expansion. However, the differences of yield strengths and cyclic hardening behaviors of nickel-base alloys from base metals compromise the fatigue resistances of weld joints. In this study, alloy 182 and alloy 625 repair coupons were evaluated and compared based on isothermal low-cycle fatigue tests. Low-cycle fatigue behaviors of both weld metals and 1.25Cr-0.5Mo base metal were measured at 1.0%, 1.5% and 2.0% strain amplitudes. Test results indicate both nickel-base filler metals exhibit overmatching strength over the base metal due to cyclic hardening. Low-cycle fatigue tests of Heat Affected zone (HAZ) samples show the failures of alloy 625 weld joints occur in the base metal, while the failures of alloy 182 weld joints occur along the fusion boundary. The observations show strength mismatch and fatigue resistance are the key factors to determine failure locations of the joints. In addition, cyclic hardening coefficients based on kinematic hardening model were extracted from experimental data to simulate the cyclic behaviors of the weld joints. Finite element simulation results were shown to be consistent with experimental data at stabilized cycles. Cyclic behaviors of weld metal and base metal within a weld transition sample were calculated based on the numerical model.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/PVP/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/PVP2021-62939/6781337/v002t03a001-pvp2021-62939.pdf",""

We find that auditors price EMR and auditor turnover is more likely to occur when EMR increases, indicating that EMR is associated with auditors' risk assessment. We also find evidence that EMR is positively and significantly associated with audit fees and auditor switching for companies with Big N auditors but not for other companies, suggesting that Big N auditors are more responsive to risks captured by EMR. Additional analyses reveal that companies switching auditors when EMR increases are more likely to engage non-Big N auditors. Surprisingly, we find little evidence that the association between audit quality and EMR differs by auditor type. Our findings are consistent with the notion that the documented association between audit fees and EMR primarily reflects a risk premium in our setting.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-horizons/article-pdf/36/1/111/18150/i1558-7975-36-1-111.pdf",""

As a result, external loading produces movement between the prosthesis and residual limb that can lead to undesirable soft-tissue shear stresses. As these stresses are difficult to measure, limb loading is commonly used as a surrogate. However, the relationship between limb loading and the displacements responsible for those stresses remains unknown. To better understand the limb motion within the socket, an inverse kinematic analysis was performed to estimate the motion between the socket and tibia for 10 individuals with a transtibial amputation performing walking and turning activities at 3 different speeds. The authors estimated the rotational stiffness of the limb-socket body to quantify the limb properties when coupled with the socket and highlight how this approach could help inform prosthetic prescriptions. Results showed that peak transverse displacement had a significant, linear relationship with peak transverse loading. Stiffness of the limb-socket body varied significantly between individuals, activities (walking and turning), and speeds. These results suggest that transverse limb loading can serve as a surrogate for residual-limb shear stress and that the setup of a prosthesis could be individually tailored using standard motion capture and inverse kinematic analyses.","https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/jab/37/1/article-p21.xml",""

Along a similar vein, we argue that threat and coping related cues are important indicators of shareworthiness of fake news in social media. We address the following research questions associated with fake news sharing in the context of Zika virus: How do threat- and coping-related cues influence fake news sharing? We characterize threat situations that have threat and severity cues and coping responses that are based on reaction to protection and fear cues. The results indicate the significant positive effect of threat cues and protection cues on fake news sharing.

Using a nationally representative survey of prison inmates, this study analyzes veteran and nonveteran self-reports of their arrest controlling for a host of relevant demographic, mental health, and criminal history variables.

Since his first expedition to the West Indies in 1957, Richard's vast field experience (including three trips to Peru between 1968 and 1974), impressive collecting skills, and remarkable ability to detect phenotypic variation among natural populations have resulted in the description of more than 70 species of snakes (24 typhlopids, 4 leptotyphlopids), lizards, and frogs in 16 genera and 11 taxonomic families. Richard joined the faculty of the Department of Biology, University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras, in 1976 and ever since his efforts significantly advanced organismal biology research at the institution. Although primarily a systematist, his desire to understand multiple aspects of an organism's biology and contagious passion for becoming intimately familiar with animals in their natural environments provided his students the opportunity to conduct research in fields such as behavioral and evolutionary ecology. Richard's mentoring fostered the scientific interests of his graduate students, who were exposed first‐hand to every aspect of research, an invaluable experience that served as a springboard for the development of their professional careers inside and outside academia. This Commentary is a fitting tribute to an influential, unassuming scientist whose passion for turning over rocks has led to the discovery of many interesting species.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ar.24619",""

On average, youth (ages 11 to 17) spend 5.7 percent of their waking-time in their neighborhood but not at home, 60 percent at home, and 34.3 percent outside their neighborhood. Multilevel negative binomial regression models indicate that residence in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods is associated with less time in one’s neighborhood. Higher levels of local violence and the absence of a neighborhood school are negatively associated with time in-neighborhood and mediate the concentrated disadvantage effect. Fractional multinomial logit models indicate that higher violence is linked with increased time at home, and school absence is associated with increased outside-neighborhood time. Theoretical development and empirical research on neighborhood effects should incorporate findings on the extent and nature of neighborhood and broader activity space exposures among urban youth.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0003122421994219",""

Recent comparative research suggests the empowerment of women in politics is important for promoting egalitarian beliefs about women in authoritative political roles. This study extends on this perspective by examining how female empowerment in politics and economics interplays with beliefs about the relative competency of women in these institutions. We argue the empowerment of women in politics and economics is important for reducing inegalitarian beliefs about women in these institutions, but the prevalence of these beliefs hinders female empowerment in these institutions. We test these arguments using data on 86,324 respondents in 51 countries from the fifth and sixth waves of the World Value Survey. Estimates from hierarchal linear models show individuals possess more egalitarian beliefs about women in countries with greater female empowerment in politics and economics and this effect is amplified among male respondents. In addition, estimates from seemingly unrelated regression models show the prevalence of inegalitarian gender beliefs among both men and women is associated with lower levels of female empowerment. However, the prevalence of these beliefs among male respondents exerts the greatest effect on female empowerment in politics and economics. Overall, this study shows gender beliefs and the empowerment of women in politics and economics act as mutually constitutive forces of gender inequality and ideologies in contemporary society.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0020715220988571",""

A control-oriented dynamic model is first obtained based on the standard Lagrangian approach. Two different model-based control design techniques are then outlined using the developed first-principles model. First, a state-space approach based on the linear-quadratic-regulator optimal control design is proposed using the linearized (approximate) model. An integrator is added to the standard LQR design to improve upon the closed-loop tracking performance. Next, a nonlinear robust design technique is outlined using the full (nonlinear) model in Sliding-Mode Control (SMC) strategy.

Physical therapists report barriers that limit their ability to practice health promotion counseling with their patients including the availability of a brief tool to gather information about their patient's current level of activity related to specific health behaviors. The purpose of this study was to describe the development and testing of the Physical Therapy Healthy Lifestyle Appraisal (PTHLA). Methods:: The PTHLA is a patient self-report questionnaire that assesses stage of change, importance of changing, and confidence in engaging in 6 health behaviors. Physical Therapy Healthy Lifestyle Appraisal version 1 (106 items) was designed to compare different constructs for measuring stage of change and confidence in engaging in health behaviors. After pilot testing, 3 versions were tested to arrive at the 18 item PTHLA-version 3. Physical therapy patients in outpatient clinics in Michigan, Minnesota, and Texas were recruited for this multiphase study (version 1 n = 60, version 2 n = 65, and version 3 n = 28). Results:: Physical Therapy Healthy Lifestyle Appraisal version 3 consists of 3 questions for each of 6 health behavior domains; a 3-option ordinal question for assessing stage of change and 11-point rulers for assessing importance of engaging in the behavior and confidence in engaging in the behavior. Unique items from version 1 and version 2 were retained in PTHLA-version 3, whereas those items that were somewhat redundant were excluded. Behavioral definitions for the “sleep” and “stress” domains were the only changes made from the first to the second versions. Across samples and behavioral domains, scores for the 18 items generally displayed satisfactory-to-high test–retest reliabilities (Cohen Conclusions:: The PTHLA-version 3 is a reliable and efficient tool for PT practice developed by physical therapists with expertise in prevention, health promotion, and wellness. Physical therapists can use the information provided from the PTHLA to initiate conversations about behavior change with their patients. Understanding the patient's current stage of change, level of interest in changing the behavior, and confidence for changing the behavior is important information for the PT to ensure a productive and respectful conversation about behavior change.","https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/CPT.0000000000000191",""

Much of this research is based on explicit theories or empirical models that impose assumed behaviors onto boards—such as monitoring—that are thought to define their roles and duties. While these explicit perspectives have offered critical insights, we suggest it is time to consider directors' implicit beliefs of their roles and duties to understand their perspective of the board's overall role. We use a grounded theory approach to develop theoretical insights about directors' implicit views of their roles and duties. We integrate information learned from extensive interviews with active directors and executives and find that directors view themselves as strategic partners with their firms' executives. Managerial summary: How do directors view their work on their boards? This remains a critical question for corporate governance researchers and practitioners alike. To help answer this question, we conducted extensive interviews with current directors and executives. Our analysis of these interviews suggests that directors view their CEOs as generally acting in the best interests of their firms. In turn, directors consider strategically collaborating with their CEOs as critical to their board service. Recognizing the unique perspectives that directors bring to the boardroom has important implications for governance practices directed toward ensuring overall board effectiveness.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/smj.3320",""

A hydrological model was set up in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), while calibration was done using a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm and Pareto Optimization with PRISM climate data. Validation was done using the measured data from the USGS gage station at Berlin Road in the OWC watershed and water quality data were obtained from the water quality lab, Heidelberg University. Land use scenario simulations were conducted by varying percentages of agricultural land from 20% to 40%, 53.5%, 65%, and 80% while adjusting the forest area. A total of 105 simulations was run for the period 2015–2017: one with PRISM data and 20 with CMIP5 model data for each of the five land use classes scenarios. Ten variables were analyzed, including flow, sediment, organic nitrogen, organic phosphorus, mineral phosphorus, chlorophyll a, CBOD, dissolved oxygen, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus. For all the variables of interest, the average of the 20 CMIP5 simulation results show good correlation with the PRISM results with an underestimation relative to the PRISM result. The underestimation was insignificant in organic nitrogen, organic phosphorus, total nitrogen, chlorophyll a, CBOD, and total phosphorus, but was significant in CMIP5 flow, sediment, mineral phosphorus, and dissolved oxygen. A weak negative correlation was observed between agricultural land percentages and flow, and between agricultural land percentages and sediment, while a strong positive correlation was observed between agricultural land use and the water quality variables. A large increase in farmland will produce a small decrease in flow and sediment transport with a large increase in nutrient transport, which would degrade the water quality of the OWC estuary with economic implications.","https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/11/5/426/pdf",""

Voter referenda that target lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender groups may be 1 contextual factor contributing to homophobic bullying. METHODS: Data come from 14 consecutive waves (2001–2014) of cross-sectional surveys of students participating in the California Healthy Kids Survey (N = 4 977 557). Student responses were aggregated to the school level (n = 5121). Using a quasi-experimental design, we compared rates of homophobic bullying before and after Proposition 8, a voter referendum that restricted marriage to heterosexuals in November 2008. RESULTS: Interrupted time series analyses confirmed that the academic year 2008–2009, during which Proposition 8 was passed, served as a turning point in homophobic bullying. The rate of homophobic bullying increased (blinear = 1.15; P , .001) and accelerated (bquadratic = 0.08; P , .001) in the period before Proposition 8. After Proposition 8, homophobic bullying gradually decreased (blinear = 20.28; P , .05). Specificity analyses showed that these trends were not observed among students who reported that they were bullied because of their race and/or ethnicity, religion, or gender but not because of their sexual orientation. Furthermore, the presence of a protective factor specific to school contexts among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth (gay-straight alliances) was associated with a smaller increase in homophobic bullying pre–Proposition 8. CONCLUSIONS: This research provides some of the first empirical evidence that public campaigns that promote stigma may confer risk for bias-based bullying among youth.","https://publications.aap.org/aapbooks/book/chapter-pdf/787808/aap_9781610024730-part01-proposition.pdf",""

We address those questions subsequently, taking a granular look at studies in which cultural humility vis‐à‐vis psychotherapy and supervision have been examined. Based on our review of 21 psychotherapy/cultural humility studies and seven supervision/cultural humility studies, we offer critique of the research work done thus far (e.g., it being decade delimited and landlocked) and propose recommendations for future treatment and supervision investigations (e.g., internationalising cultural humility research). Because cultural humility appears to be a durable and enduring concept, appears practically beneficial for both the therapy and supervision situations and is increasingly being pursued empirically, such a research report would seem particularly timely and potentially helpful in advancing research.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/capr.12481",""

Maternal health workers are a key mechanism for conveying this information to pregnant individuals. The authors assess a training of maternal health workers in El Paso, Texas, through two research instruments. First, eight maternal health workers completed an educational workshop and consented to participation; pre- and post-test workshop data are reported. Second, and subsequent to the workshop, a focus group was undertaken with six maternal health workers; directed content analysis was used to synthesize and report patterns from this qualitative data. Assessments indicated that a training session can improve provider knowledge of maternal heat–health risks and can encourage providers to discuss heat risks with patients/clients. This pilot project offered an approach to raise awareness of extreme heat among maternal health workers. The authors encourage the development of similar trainings in other communities to improve the safety of pregnant individuals in warm regions and areas experiencing extreme heat.","https://scholarworks.waldenu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1443&amp;context=jsbhs&amp;unstamped=1",""

Integrating signalling theory with uncertainty reduction theory, we propose a cross‐level model linking department‐level HPWS to employee job burnout. Specifically, we propose the mediating role of organisation‐based self‐esteem (OBSE) in the effect of department HPWS on employee job burnout, as well as the moderating role of departmental formalisation. Using a sample of 366 employees and 60 managers from 60 departments, we found that department‐level HPWS was associated with reduced employee job burnout both directly and indirectly through OBSE. In addition, the mitigating influence of department‐level HPWS on employee job burnout was significant only when departmental formalisation was high.

Methods: Data were from the 2015–2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (young adult N = 38,298). Past-year prescription opioid, stimulant and benzodiazepine use and PDM were outcomes, with PDM defined as use without a prescription or in ways not intended by the prescriber. Separate regressions by sex evaluated the relationship between prescription medication use or PDM prevalence and sexual identity, educational status/attainment (college student/graduate versus non-college), their interaction and past-year psychological distress. Results: Sexual identity minority young adults had higher rates of prescription use and PDM than heterosexual young adults. After accounting for educational status, though, bisexual men rarely differed from heterosexual men; after including psychological distress, gay men rarely differed from heterosexual men. Versus heterosexual women, lesbian (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.33, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.47–2.30) and bisexual (AOR= 1.78, 95% CI = 1.27–2.50) young adult women had higher rates of prescription opioid misuse, after adjusting for educational status, psychological distress and sociodemographics. Versus heterosexual men, benzodiazepine PDM was elevated in gay men (AOR = 1.91, 95% CI= 1.02–3.58). Educational status was generally associated with lower rates of prescription use and PDM, except for stimulant PDM. Conclusions: Screening for psychological distress and PDM is needed in sexual identity minority young adults, especially for prescription opioid misuse among sexual identity minority women. Culturally-sensitive intervention should be considered for those with elevated psychological distress or signs of PDM. Further research on the sex differences found in the link between psychological distress and sexual identity minority opioid and stimulant PDM is warranted.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/08897077.2020.1784358",""

In this study, 51 Chinese-native listeners were randomly assigned into three groups, including vowel training in quiet (TIQ), vowel training in noise (TIN), and watching videos in English as an active control. Vowel identification was assessed before (T1), right after (T2), and three months after training (T3) in quiet and various noise conditions. Results indicated that compared with the video watching group, the TIN group improved vowel identification in both quiet and noise significantly more at T2 and at T3. In contrast, the TIQ group improved significantly more in quiet and also in non-speech noise conditions at T2, but the improvement did not hold at T3. Moreover, compared to the TIQ group, the TIN group showed significantly less informational masking at both T2 and T3 and less energetic masking at T3.

Porous chitosan-agarose (CHAG) scaffolds were synthesized, freeze-dried, and compared to bulk agarose (AG) scaffolds. Both scaffold types were seeded with osteoarthritic human AChs and cultured in a novel perfusion system for one week with a shear-inducing medium flow velocity of 0.33 mm/s corresponding to an average surficial shear of 0.4 mPa and a CHAG interstitial shear of 40 mPa. While there were no statistical differences in cell viability for perfusion vs. static cultures for either scaffold type, CHAG scaffold cultures exhibited 3.3-fold higher (p<0.005) cell viability compared to AG scaffold cultures. Effects of combined superficial and interstitial perfusion for CHAG showed 150- and 45-fold (p<0.0001) increases in total collagen (COL) and 13- and 2.2-fold (p<0.001) increases in glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) over AG’s scaffold non-perfusion and perfusion cultures, respectively, and a 1.5-fold and 3.6-fold (p<0.005) increase over non-perfusion CHAG cultures. Contrasting CHAG perfusion and static cultures, chondrogenic gene comparisons showed a 3.5-fold increase in collagen type II/type I (COL2A1/COL1A1) mRNA ratio (p<0.05), and a 1.3-fold increase in aggrecan mRNA. Observed effects are suggested to be the result of inhibiting the inflammatory NF-κB signal transduction pathway as confirmed by a further study that indicated a reduction by 3.2-fold (p<0.05) upon exposure to perfusion. Our results demonstrate that the presence of pores plays a critical role in improving cell viability and that interstitial flow caused by medium perfusion through the porous scaffolds enhances the expression of chondrogenic genes and ECM components through the downregulation of NF-κB1.","",""

To date, much of this research has focused on quantifiable outcomes such as reading test scores, and few efforts have been made to synthesize studies of adolescent literacy interventions that attend to how students themselves experience those interventions and what mediates their experiences, which previous adolescent literacy research suggests should be considered alongside other outcomes. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study:: This meta-synthesis of qualitative research highlights additional factors that are overlooked when evidence of effectiveness is defined predominantly through assessment outcomes. It contributes insights from two decades of research on reading intervention classes (RICs), which are a long-standing approach to adolescent literacy intervention. We define RICs as compulsory, yearlong courses that supplement content-area classes with the goal of improving adolescents’ reading. Grounded in sociocultural theories of literacy and learning, our research question was: How do students experience and perceive RICs? Research Design:: We conducted a qualitative meta-synthesis of 21 studies published between 2000 and 2020 that (1) focused on secondary (grades 6–12) RICs in the United States and (2) included data related to students’ experiences and perspectives. Data Collection and Analysis:: We followed best practices in qualitative meta-synthesis, including assembling an author team composed of researchers with expertise in RICs, identifying a research meta-question, conducting a comprehensive search, selecting and appraising relevant studies, and coding and presenting findings using qualitative techniques. Findings/Results:: We found that youth’s own diverse understandings of themselves as readers and writers, combined with the extent to which they viewed their RICs as relevant, agentive, and facilitative of relationships, mediated students’ experiences and perceptions of their RICs. In addition, students across studies described placement policies and practices as confusing, frustrating, and embarrassing. Conclusions/Recommendations:: By providing a perspective that extends beyond test scores, the findings highlight some of the consequences of intervention placement policies and practices for adolescents. They also address the need for educational stakeholders to expand definitions of what counts as evidence of effectiveness to inform the future development of re-mediated literacy learning opportunities for adolescents that (1) rethink curriculum and instruction to affirm students’ literacy identities, histories, and capacities, and (2) reposition youth as literacy knowers and doers.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/01614681211048624",""

However, recent research reported that while automated tornado warnings, sent by the National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center via the account @NWStornado on Twitter, included useful information about the location of the threat, the potential impacts, and populations at risk, it failed to provide content that would contribute to successful protective actions. In this experimental study we investigate how the inclusion and presentation of protective action guidance affects participant perceptions of a tornado warning message and their perceived ability to act upon the information (i.e., self- and response-efficacy). We find that the inclusion of protective action guidance results an increase in the participants’ understanding of the message, their ability to decide what to do, and their perceived self- and response-efficacy. Knowing how to take action to protect oneself, and believing the actions will make oneself safe, are key motivators to taking action when faced with a significant threat. Future warning research should draw from other persuasive messaging and health behavior theories, and should include self- and response- efficacy as important causal factors. It should also look across additional hazards to determine if these outcomes differ by the length of forewarning and hazard type.","https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/aop/WCAS-D-21-0097.1/WCAS-D-21-0097.1.xml",""

To accomplish this, porcine urinary bladder submucosa was decellularized to produce a urinary bladder matrix (UBM) which produced acellular sheets of UBM. The UBM was cultured with human umbilical vein endothelial cells producing a nearly confluent monolayer of cells with the maintenance of typical histologic features demonstrating UBM to be a suitable substrate for endothelial cells. A lamination process created bilayer UBM sheets which were formed into biologic reservoirs. BEPs were constructed by securing the biologic reservoir between inlet and outlet valves and compressed with a polyurethane balloon. BEP function was evaluated in a simple flow loop representative of a modified subpulmonary Fontan circulation. A BEP with a 92-mL biologic reservoir operating at 60 cycles per minute produced pulsatile downstream flows without flow obstruction and generated a favorable pressure gradient across the device, maintaining upstream pressure of 6 mm Hg and producing downstream pressure of 13 mm Hg. The BEP represents potential long-term assistance for the Fontan circulation to relieve venous hypertension, provide pulsatile pulmonary blood flow and maintain cardiac preload.","https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/MAT.0000000000001617",""

The primary objective of this case study is to better understand the business case economics of a specialty chemical plant using modular chemical process intensification (MCPI), by comparing it with that of a conventional stick‐built (CSB) plant that produces the same product at the same production capacity. When comparing MCPI against CSB approaches for a plant project strategy decision, analysts should thoroughly understand and model the differences and similarities in scope bases. The MCPI approach for this case study benefitted from dramatic reductions in capital expenditures (CAPEX). A sizeable reduction in plant spatial volume likely explains some of these reductions. Sizeable operational expenditure (OPEX) reductions with the MCPI plant appear to be associated with the reduced operator staffing required from converting a labor‐intensive batch process into an automated, continuous flow process. Traditional project investment economic measures strongly favored the MCPI case for the design, construction, and operation of the specialty chemical plant. The net present value for the MCPI case was nearly twice that for the CSB case over a ten‐year period, and the payback period for the CSB case was nearly five times longer than that of the MCPI case. The opinion‐based perspective of the study participant identified significant contributors to superior MCPI economic performance for this case study. With the two conditions of low MCPI CAPEX and high product profit margin, economic analysis indicates that incorporation of a backup MCPI train, for operational redundancy when downtime occurs, is a very beneficial strategy.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/amp2.10102",""

Limited data describe out‐of‐hospital dyspnea treatment with non‐invasive, positive‐pressure ventilation (NIPPV), including continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bi‐level positive air pressure (BPAP). We sought to determine the course and outcomes of out‐of‐hospital acute dyspnea patients treated with NIPPV. Methods: We analyzed retrospective data on 1289 EMS agencies from the ESO Data Collaborative (ESO, Inc., Austin, TX) between January and December 2018. We defined acute dyspnea as adults with an initial respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths/min (bpm), with a primary or secondary EMS subjective impression of a respiratory condition, who received oxygen and/or a respiratory medication and had 2 or more recordings of respiratory rate (RR). We excluded patients with trauma and those with altered mental status. We identified cases receiving care with and without NIPPV. The primary outcome was change in respiratory rate (RR), censored at 90 minutes of treatment. We compared baseline characteristics between NIPPV and non‐NIPPV patients. We compared RR changes between NIPPV and non‐NIPPV patients at 20 and 40 minutes of treatment. Using mixed linear, fractional polynomial, and multiple spline models, we examined the association of out‐of‐hospital NIPPV with overall change in RR. Secondary outcomes included whether the patient received advanced airway treatment (intubation, supraglottic airway device, and/or cricothyroidotomy). Results: We analyzed 33,585 EMS encounters for patients with acute dyspnea, including 8,750 (26.1%) NIPPV and 24,835 (73.9%) non‐NIPPV encounters. Median treatment duration was similar between NIPPV and non‐NIPPV (23.3 minutes vs 23.6 minutes, rank‐sum Conclusions: NIPPV has been proven to be an effective treatment for out‐of‐hospital patients experiencing acute dyspnea through prior studies. Our findings provide detailed insight into characteristics and use of NIPPV and highlight the commonality of this treatment modality with use in over 1 in 4 patients in respiratory distress.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/emp2.12542",""

Process intensification can enable chemical plants to be constructed in a more compact, modular fashion, offering improvements over conventional on‐site approaches to capital construction, operations and maintenance. This modular chemical process intensification (MCPI) offers several benefits over conventional stick‐built (CSB) plant construction in terms of reduced footprint, reduced energy consumption, lower cost, less waste and improved safety and quality control. However, acceptance of MCPI over CSB construction practices within the chemical industry can be impeded by the uncertain risks associated with investing in new technology. The work here documents a case study during the development of a modular chemical plant for capturing distributed energy resources within chemical production. This MCPI approach to plant construction is contrasted with a CSB approach for producing the same chemical product. Data collection tools were developed, based on a literature review, and data was collected from the technology developer to understand the process technology. Sensitivity analysis was then conducted to analyze the business rationale for the application of MCPI over CSB across several market scenarios. It was found that MCPI would be better suited for capacities up to 150 000 metric tons per year, but that improvement in payback period was needed. Additionally, for MCPI approach to achieve acceptable payback periods, efforts are needed to reduce the cost of capital equipment and compress the schedule for ramping up modular production.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/amp2.10096",""

The regulation of this pathway is critical particularly to guard against tumorigenesis due to chromosomal rearrangements. RAD54L, the DNA motor ATPase, performs as the key player in HRR whose regulation in higher eukaryotes is still unclear. Studies have shown post-translational modification of RAD54L imparting specific functions toward the progression of HRR. Tousled-like kinase homolog1 (TLK1), a Ser/Thr Kinase, is known to regulate DNA damage response through NEK1-ATR axis. But its role in the mechanism in DSB repair is still unknown. We recently uncovered the interaction between TLK1 and RAD54L through an invitro proteomic array of TLK1 interacting partners. The crystal structure of RAD54L reveals distinct features about the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the protein. The unstructured NTD (1-90) is important for interaction with its physiological partner protein RAD51 while the structured CTD (660-747) (Zn-finger-like motif) contacts the DNA backbone in the donor template. Therefore, it is interesting to study the regulation of RAD54 function by TLK1.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/81/13_Supplement/2063/667909/Abstract-2063-TLK1-phosphorylates-RAD54-to-promote",""

Results: Thirty-eight patients with recurrent GBM were administered macitentan doses up to 300 mg once daily; no dose-limiting toxicities were observed, and a maximum tolerated dose was not determined. All patients experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE), the majority associated with GBM or TMZ treatment. TEAEs related to macitentan and TMZ were reported for 16 (42.1%) and 26 (68.4%) patients, respectively, with no serious macitentan-related TEAEs. Macitentan concentrations increased with dose, with no plateau in exposure. Substantial heterogeneity was observed in the expression of efficacy biomarkers within tumors. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of median overall survival across all dose groups was 9.4 (95% CI 8.5, 13.4) months. Conclusion: High-dose macitentan was well tolerated in recurrent GBM patients concomitantly receiving TMZ. TEAEs were consistent with those seen in patients receiving either drug individually.","http://academic.oup.com/noa/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/noajnl/vdab141/40500239/vdab141.pdf",""

This exploratory, grounded theory study captures insights of women veterans ( n = 20) entering service between 1964 and 2016. Full inclusion is alleged, yet military women are objectified and “othered,” targets of sex-based attention, predation, and violence.

To mitigate this, a renewed commitment to the US military’s historical ideal of altruistic care is necessary to realize the full inclusion of women and reduce if not eliminate military sexual violence.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0095327X211044526",""

We report a case of immunoglobulin (Ig) D multiple myeloma with a hidden lambda (λ) light chain. Methods/Case Report: Capillary electrophoresis (CE) (Sebia CAPILLARYS 2) was used to detect and quantify M- proteins in serum specimens. Immunosubtraction (IS) on the CAPILLARYS 2 systems was used to identify the classes of M-proteins. Conventional gel immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) was performed, using monospecific antisera for IgD, IgE, kappa (κ) or λ in the Sebia HYDRASYS system, and IgG, IgA, IgM, κ or λ in the Helena SPIFE3000 system. Beta-mercaptoethanol (BME) with Fluidil were used as reduction agents. Results (if a Case Study enter NA): Results of serum CE showed two abnormal peaks in beta 2 and gamma regions, suspected to be positive for M-proteins. IS results showed subtraction for λ light chain only in both peaks, suggesting two monoclonal λ light chains. In contrary, no monoclonal λ light chain was detected in gamma region by IFE (Sebia). Epitope masking in the folded monoclonal protein was suspected to cause the “hidden λ light chain” and was further investigated by two laboratory approaches. IFE performed on the Helena SPIFE3000 system found two λ bands in beta 2 and gamma regions, which was consistent with the results from IS. The treatment of BME with Fluidil helped unmasking the hidden epitope and revealed the λ band in gamma region on IFE (Sebia). Conclusion: The medical laboratories should be aware of the described scenario. The failure to detect light chains of certain intact M-proteins is most likely due to the structurally inaccessibility of light chains. It is recommended that treatment with reduction agents or use of an alternative methodology or IS might be helpful for investigating suspected heavy chain only cases, due to the limitation of conventional methodology.","http://academic.oup.com/ajcp/article-pdf/156/Supplement_1/S31/40943992/aqab191.061.pdf",""

Our aims were to determine whether 1) caregiver experiences and health differed across urban and rural areas; and 2) these links were moderated by caregiver race/ethnicity. We used data from the 2017 National Health and Aging Trends Study and National Study of Caregiving. The sample included caregivers (n=808) of care recipients ages 65+ with ‘probable’ ADRD (n=482). Geographic context was defined as care recipient’s residence in metro (urban) or non-metro (rural) counties. Outcomes included caregiving experiences (burden, gains, life impacts, service/resource use) and health (self-rated, anxiety, depression symptoms, chronic health conditions). Bivariate analyses indicated that non-metro ADRD caregivers were less racially/ethnically diverse (82.7% white) and more were spouses/partners (20.2%). Among racial/ethnic minority ADRD caregivers, non-metro context was associated with having more chronic conditions (p&lt;.01), providing less care (p&lt;.01), and not co-residing with care recipients (p&lt;.001). Amid white ADRD caregivers, non-metro context was associated with not reporting caregiving was more than they could handle (p&lt;.05) and finding financial assistance for caregiving (p&lt;.05). Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated that non-metro minority ADRD caregivers had 3.09 times higher odds (95% CI=1,02-9.36) of reporting anxiety in comparison to metro minority ADRD caregivers. Geographic context shapes ADRD caregiving experiences and caregiver health differently across racial/ethnic groups. Despite higher rates of ADRD and ADRD-related mortality in non-metro areas, findings suggest both positive and negative aspects of caregiving among White, Black, and Hispanic ADRD caregivers.","https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/5/Supplement_1/990/43189784/igab046.3557.pdf",""

These were subjected to a discourse and content analysis, utilizing a process tracing approach to systematically record the gradual construction of VTAELL policy. The narrative shows that policy evolution in this field can be grouped into three distinct stages: policy groundwork; programmatic operationalization; consolidation, integration and expansion.

Accordingly, the World Health Organization implemented the #HealthyAtHome program, encouraging people to keep in regular contact with loved ones, stay physically active, and keep a regular routine. The current study aims to examine a micro-longitudinal link between positive coping strategies (e.g., exercise, meditation, relaxation, and virtual social contacts) and depressive symptoms among older adults who live alone during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used 21 biweekly waves of longitudinal data from the Understanding America Study (UAS) collected between April 2020 and February 2021 (N=839, observation= 16,256). The multilevel models with correlated random effects were estimated to examine lagged effects of coping strategies (t-1) on depressive symptoms (t). The analysis used the xthybrid command with clustered standard errors in Stata 15.1. The results show that exercise (b=-.10, p=0.02), relaxation (b=-02, p=0.01), and virtual social contacts (b=-.01, p=0.01) were predictive of lower depressive symptoms even after controlling for time-invariant and time-varying covariates. Meditation, however, was associated with higher depressive symptoms (b=.01, p=0.02). The results show that modifiable lifestyle factors, such as taking time to exercise or relax, may enhance mental health and well-being for older adults living alone. Virtual social contacts such as video calls could be an effective way to keep older adults socially connected and emotionally healthy.","https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/5/Supplement_1/438/43183888/igab046.1704.pdf",""

The service‐dominant (S‐D) logic argues that value to consumers is always co‐created by service providers and consumers jointly and reciprocally. While prior research has addressed the indirect impact of structural, infrastructural, and technology service design attributes on a customer’s perceived value via the realized service delivery system, an important question remains unanswered: Do these strategic service design attributes directly affect co‐created service choice? In this study, we explicitly consider the extent to which service delivery design characteristics—structural, infrastructural, and technology attributes— directly affect this co‐created choice. Using detailed patient‐level data from Florida hospitals on elective hip and knee surgeries, we find evidence of structural, infrastructural, and technological influences on patient–surgeon co‐created choice of hospitals. We also find that the characteristics of the service encounter—in this case, the interpersonal care experience—interact in essential ways with these design attributes to influence co‐created service choice. Specifically, structural and technological attributes may serve as a substitute for interpersonal care experience in determining co‐created choice of a hospital. These results inform our understanding of how patients choose hospitals for elective surgeries under conditions of information asymmetry. An extended analysis of data for elective heart surgery patients generally supports our framework.

There are many clinical situations in which CNS tissue might be removed prior to administration of a therapeutic nanoparticle; however, the iatrogenic effects of surgical resection on nanoparticle deposition in the brain remain unknown. We hypothesized that resection would facilitate nanoparticle delivery to peri-resection tissue as a function of timing of nanoparticle administration after removal of tissue. To test this hypothesis polystyrene nanoparticles surface modified with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) were administered either immediately, 2 hours, 24 hours, 4 days, or 7 days after resection of murine cortex. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that minimal nanoparticle delivery to brain vasculature was observed in healthy mice, yet significant nanoparticle delivery was observed in mice that received resection. Spatially, nanoparticles were confined to the vascular compartment and did not enter the parenchyma. Nanoparticle delivery was high near the resection boundary and declined with distance into the peri-resection tissue. The highest level of delivery was observed when nanoparticles were administered immediately after resection, and FNPs could be detected in the CNS when nanoparticles were administered up to 24 hours after resection. The diameter of blood vessels that contained nanoparticles was significantly greater than the diameter of blood vessels that did not contain nanoparticles, and larger vessels contained brighter clusters of nanoparticles. These relationships depended on time after resection, suggesting that a dynamic vascular response.

As such, species-habitat relationships have long been studied, particularly in the field of wildlife ecology and to a lesser extent in the more encompassing discipline of ecology. The habitat requirements of a species largely determine its spatial distribution and abundance in nature. One way to recognize and appreciate the over-riding importance of habitat is to consider that a young organism must find and settle into the appropriate type of habitat as one of the first challenges of life. This process can be cast in a probabilistic framework and used to better understand the mechanisms behind habitat preferences and selection. There are at least six distinctly different statistical approaches to conducting a habitat analysis – that is, identifying and quantifying the environmental variables that a species most strongly associates with. These are (1) comparison among group means (e.g., ANOVA), (2) multiple linear regression, (3) multiple logistic regression, (4) classification and regression trees, (5) multivariate techniques (Principal Components Analysis and Discriminant Function Analysis), and (6) occupancy modelling. Each of these is lucidly explained and demonstrated by application to a hypothetical dataset. The strengths and weaknesses of each method are discussed. Given the ongoing biodiversity crisis largely caused by habitat destruction, there is a crucial and general need to better characterize and understand the habitat requirements of many different species, particularly those that are threatened and endangered.","",""

Background: Understanding 2D cross-sections of 3D structures is a crucial skill in many disciplines, from geology to medical imaging . It requires a complex set of spatial/visualization skills including mental rotation, spatial structure understanding, and viewpoint projection. Prior studies show that experts differ from novices in these skills. Method: We have developed a novel training tool for inferring 2D cross-sections of 3D structures using a participatory design methodology. We used a between-subject study design, with 60 participants, to evaluate the training tool. Our primary effectiveness evaluation was based on pre- and postspatial tests that measured both cross-section abilities and specific spatial skills: viewpoint, mental rotation, and card rotation. Results: Results showed significant performance gains on inferring 2D cross-sections for participants of the training group. Our tool improves two other spatial skills as well: mental rotation and viewpoint visualization. Conclusion: Our training tool was effective not only in enhancing 2D cross-section understanding of complex 3D structures, but also in improving mental rotation and viewpoint visualization skills. Application: Our tool can be beneficial in different fields such as medical imaging, biology, geology, and engineering. For example, an application of our tool is in medical/research labs to train novice segmenters in ongoing manual 3D segmentation tasks. It can also be adapted in other contexts, such as training children, older adults, and individuals with very low spatial skills.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/00187208211018110",""

We conducted a study of exhumation of fault blocks along a transect from the southeastern Basin and Range to across the RGR in southern New Mexico. A suite of 128 apatite and 63 zircon (U-Th)/He dates (AHe and ZHe), as well as 27 apatite fission-track (AFT) dates, was collected to investigate the cooling and exhumation histories of this region. Collectively, AHe dates range from 3 to 46 Ma, ZHe dates range from 2 to 288 Ma, and AFT dates range from 10 to 34 Ma with average track lengths of 10.8–14.1 µm. First-order spatiotemporal trends in the combined data set suggest that Basin and Range extension was either contemporaneous with Eocene–Oligocene Mogollon-Datil volcanism or occurred before volcanism ended ca. 28 Ma, as shown by trends in ZHe data that suggest reheating to above 240 °C at that time. AHe and ZHe dates from the southern RGR represent a wider range in dates that suggest the main phase of cooling occurred after 25 Ma, and these blocks were not reheated after exhumation. Time-temperature models created by combining AHe, AFT, and ZHe data in the modeling software HeFTy were used to interpret patterns in cooling rate across the study area and further constrain magmatic and/or volcanic versus faulting related cooling. The Chiricahua Mountains and Burro Mountains have an onset of rapid extension, defined as cooling rates in excess of &gt;15 °C/m.y., at ca. 29–17 Ma. In the Cookes Range, a period of rapid extension occurred at ca. 19–7 Ma. In the San Andres Mountains, Franklin Mountains, Caballo Mountains, and Fra Cristobal range, rapid extension occurred from ca. 23 to 9 Ma. Measured average track lengths are longer in Rio Grande rift samples, and ZHe dates of &gt;40 Ma are mostly present east of the Cookes Range, suggesting different levels of exhumation for the zircon partial retention zone and the AFT partial annealing zone. The main phase of fault-block uplift in the southern RGR occurred ca. 25–7 Ma, similar to what has been documented in the northern and central sections of the rift. Although rapid cooling occurred throughout southern New Mexico, thermochronological data from this study with magmatic and volcanic ages suggest rapid cooling was coeval with magmatism in the Basin and Range, whereas in the Rio Grande rift cooling occurred during an amagmatic gap. These observations support a model where an early phase of extension was facilitated by widespread ignimbrite magmatism in the southeastern Basin and Range, whereas in the southern Rio Grande rift, extension started later and continues today and may have occurred between local episodes of basaltic magmatism. These differences in cooling history make the Rio Grande rift tectonically distinct from the Basin and Range. We infer based on geologic and thermochronological evidence that the onset of extension in the southern Rio Grande rift occurred at ca. 27–25 Ma, significantly later than earlier estimates of ca. 35 Ma.","https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geosphere/article-pdf/17/6/1807/5476325/1807.pdf",""

Five domains of contributing factors were included: socio-demographic characteristics, context of care, caregivers’ psychological attributes, informal and formal support. Multiple logistic regressions showed that caregivers with higher psychological attribute levels were more likely to be resilient in all three groups.

A diverse CSD workforce can improve access to services and reduce health care disparities for diverse populations. Increasing diversity of the workforce begins with recruiting and training a diverse student body in CSD academic programs. In the absence of relevant literature in CSD, the primary objective of this tutorial is to introduce readers to successful diversity and inclusion programs in health-related disciplines such as nursing, medicine, rehabilitation sciences, public health, and clinical psychology, as well as provide recommendations for developing a racially and ethnically diverse and inclusive CSD academic program. Conclusions: We group the evidence from other health-related academic programs for increasing diversity and inclusion under three headings—(a) recruitment, (b) inclusion, and (c) retention of underrepresented racial and ethnic minority (UREM) students. Based on this information, we have designed the Recruit–Equip–Access–Progress model to illustrate the strategies for a diverse and inclusive CSD training program. We recommend the following for UREM students in this model—(a) developing pipeline programs, institutional partnerships, and holistic admissions reviews; (b) equipping students with academic and financial supports; (c) providing students access to faculty and peer mentors; and (d) evaluating outcomes and processes associated with student and program success. Given the limited literature concerning successful diversity initiatives in our field, we encourage administrators and educators to implement these strategies, systematically evaluate the outcomes, and publish the results for other programs to adopt.","http://pubs.asha.org/doi/pdf/10.1044/2021_PERSP-20-00285",""

Average vertical deposition rates for units that represent the Late Pleistocene glacial periods are 0.1–0.5 m/k.y. Glacial-age deposits are sand rich; in contrast, post-glacial deposits lack a significant sand fraction and are dominated by carbonate-rich mud. As a result, seismically constrained volumetric rates of deposition for glacial periods with low sea level and a subaerially exposed shelf are ∼0.23 km3/k.y., 2×–5× higher than rates during interglacials when sea level is high, the shelf is submerged, and sand is trapped in shallow-marine environments. At millennial time scales, variations in deposition rate reflect climate-driven sea-level changes, autogenic avulsion of river channels that extend across the shelf during low sea level, and autogenic avulsion of submarine channels that shift the locus of deposition laterally. Short-term deposition rates range from 8.6 m/k.y. at proximal portions of submarine fans to 0.4 m/k.y. along the distal fringe. Our data show that submarine fans can be dynamic environments with formation and evolution of levee-confined channels and lobe complexes in 103–104 yr, comparable to the time scales needed to form fluvial channel belts and delta lobes.","http://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-pdf/49/10/1204/5413448/g48911.1.pdf",""

The system is heavily loaded in the Halfin–Whitt regime, and the scheduling policies are work conserving and preemptive. We provide a unified approach via a Lyapunov function method that establishes Foster–Lyapunov equations for both the limiting diffusion and the prelimit diffusion-scaled queuing processes simultaneously. We first study the limiting controlled diffusion and show that if the spare capacity (safety staffing) parameter is positive, the diffusion is exponentially ergodic uniformly over all stationary Markov controls, and the invariant probability measures have uniform exponential tails. This result is sharp because when there is no abandonment and the spare capacity parameter is negative, the controlled diffusion is transient under any Markov control. In addition, we show that if all the abandonment rates are positive, the invariant probability measures have sub-Gaussian tails regardless whether the spare capacity parameter is positive or negative. Using these results, we proceed to establish the corresponding ergodic properties for the diffusion-scaled queuing processes. In addition to providing a simpler proof of previous results in Gamarnik and Stolyar [Gamarnik D, Stolyar AL (2012) Multiclass multiserver queueing system in the Halfin-Whitt heavy traffic regime: asymptotics of the stationary distribution. Queueing Systems 71(1–2):25–51], we extend these results to multiclass models with renewal arrival processes, albeit under the assumption that the mean residual life functions are bounded. For the Markovian model with Poisson arrivals, we obtain stronger results and show that the convergence to the stationary distribution is at an exponential rate uniformly over all work-conserving stationary Markov scheduling policies.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/moor.2020.1087",""

This study investigated the suitability of in vitro toxicity testing methods as a rapid means of identifying areas of potential human health concern. We used sediment samples (n = 46) from Galveston Bay and the Houston Ship Channel (GB/HSC) areas after hurricane Harvey, a disaster event that led to broad redistribution of chemically-contaminated sediments, including deposition of the sediment on shore due to flooding. Samples were extracted with cyclohexane and dimethyl sulfoxide and screened in a compendium of human primary or induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cell lines from different tissues (hepatocytes, neuronal, cardiomyocytes, and endothelial) to test for concentration-dependent effects on various functional and cytotoxicity phenotypes (n = 34). Bioactivity data were used to map areas of potential concern and the results compared to the data on concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the same samples. We found that setting remediation goals based on reducing bioactivity is protective of both “known” risks associated with PAHs and “unknown” risks associated with bioactivity, but the converse was not true for remediation based on PAH risks alone. Overall, we found that in vitro bioactivity can be used as a comprehensive indicator of potential hazards and is an example of a new approach method (NAM) to inform risk management decisions on site cleanup.","https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/24/13378/pdf",""

Far fewer studies target English learners (ELs). Purpose: The impact of an SE intervention on the development of science, engineering, and technology knowledge as well as engineering identity was examined. To address ELs' learning needs, the curricular design was built on a validated SE model by integrating (1) developmental, (2) language scaffolds, and (3) culturally based accommodations. Design/Method: Separate analysis of variance examined the effects of the intervention on science, engineering, and technology knowledge as well as engineering identity. The relationship among engineering identity and content outcomes was also examined. ELs from kindergarten to second grade classrooms were randomly assigned to the integrated SE group or control group. Results: Integrated SE instruction significantly increased ELs' science, engineering, and technology knowledge as well as a substantially developed engineering identity. Overall, ELs' engineering identity is associated with an increase in science, engineering, and technology content knowledge. However, second grade girls' identity development was not associated with learning measures. These correlations suggest the context of the engineering activity may have reinforced gendered stereotypes and reduced the effects for girls' engineering attitudes. Conclusions: Integrated SE instruction emphasizing disciplinary literacy and cultural accommodations increases early elementary ELs' learning and engineering identity.

We report here a pilot study to demonstrate feasibility and acceptability of incorporating this intervention in conjunction with population-based cancer risk assessment in a clinical setting with medically underserved AA women. Methods AA women recommended for GC based on cancer genetic risk assessment performed in a mammography center were recruited at the time of the mammogram. A prospective, pre-post survey study design, guided by theoretical constructs, was used to evaluate baseline and immediate post-intervention psychosocial factors, including intention to participate in GC and intervention satisfaction. Results Pilot recruitment goals were met (n=30). Pre-intervention, 50% of participants indicated that they were extremely likely to make a GC appointment, compared with 70% post-intervention (p=0.0001).

Due to age-related risks, the older adult population has uniquely experienced negative changes caused by the pandemic. Research has also shown that the pandemic has disproportionately affected women. Therefore, it is important to understand how the mental health of older women has been impacted during this global crisis. This study aims to examine the differences in mental health indices in a sample of older women before versus during the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, participants include 201 women (aged 60-94) who completed an online survey of self-report measures assessing depression, anxiety, alcohol use, binge eating, positive affect, and emotional quality of life (QOL). We conducted one-way ANOVAs to compare each mental health construct in two samples of older women collected pre- and peri-pandemic. Results indicated that the peri-pandemic group reported significantly higher anxiety (F = 5.25, p = .02), with a trend for more role limitations due to emotional problems (F = 2.79, p = .09), than the pre-pandemic group. No significant differences emerged for levels of depression, alcohol consumption, binge eating, positive affect, or emotional wellbeing between groups. These findings point to the psychological resilience of older adults in the face of extreme adverse events, including this global crisis. Older women, while impacted differently during the COVID-19 pandemic, reported minimal exacerbations of mental health problems compared to older women pre-pandemic. Efforts to identify moderators that may either attenuate or promote further psychological resilience among older adults is warranted.","https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/5/Supplement_1/717/43187409/igab046.2678.pdf",""

Angus heifers (n = 20/ group) were classified as low (14.7 ± 1.1) or high (32 ± 1.1) antral follicle number based on ovarian ultrasonography, and artificially inseminated (d0) following a Select Synch protocol. At d16 after insemination, heifers were slaughtered, and reproductive tracts collected. Tracts were flushed with 20 mL of physiological saline to determine pregnancy status by presence of a conceptus and endometrial samples from the horn ipsilateral to the CL were frozen for determination of transcript abundance. Real-time RT-PCR was performed to determine relative transcript abundance of oxytocin receptor (OXTR) and interferon-stimulated gene-15 (ISG15) with glyceraldehyde-3-phospate dehydrogenase as the endogenous reference gene. Transcript abundance was analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS with follicle group, pregnancy status and the interaction as fixed effects. Transcript abundance of ISG15 was greater in pregnant endometrium than non-pregnant endometrium (2.75 ± 0.25 vs 0.16 ± 0.22-fold; P &lt; 0.0001) with no influence of follicle group or the interaction.

Here, we revisited and characterized the HupZ-V5-His6 protein via biochemical, mutagenesis, protein quaternary structure, UV–vis, EPR, and resonance Raman spectroscopies. The results show that the ferric heme-protein complex did not display an expected ferric EPR signal and that heme binding to HupZ triggered the formation of higher oligomeric states. We found that heme binding to HupZ was an O2-dependent process. The single histidine residue in the HupZ sequence, His111, did not bind to the ferric heme, nor was it involved with the weak heme-degradation activity. Our results do not favor the heme oxygenase assignment because of the slow binding of heme and the newly discovered association of the weak heme degradation activity with the His6-tag. Altogether, the data suggest that the protein binds heme by its His6-tag, resulting in a heme-induced higher-order oligomeric structure and heme stacking.

The new lands that emerge from retreating glaciers provide a host of challenges for ecological and human adaptation to climate change. In these novel proglacial landscapes, ecological succession and natural hazards interplay with local agriculture, hydroelectric production, mining activities, and tourism. Research has emphasized the importance of understanding adaptation around socio‐environmental systems, but regional and global management efforts that support local initiatives and connect novel proglacial landscapes to ecological, social, and cultural conservation opportunities are rare and nascent. The characteristics of these emerging lands reflect the nexus of alpine ecosystems with socio‐political histories. Often overlooked in glacial‐influenced systems are the interdependencies, feedbacks, and tradeoffs between these biophysical systems and local populations. There is no coordinated strategy to manage and anticipate these shifting dynamics, while affirming local practices and contexts. There is an opportunity to initiate a new conversation and co‐create a governance structure around these novel landscapes and develop a new framework suitable to the Anthropocene era. This article first synthesizes the rapid socio‐environmental changes that are occurring in proglacial landscapes. Second, we consider the need for integrating “bottom‐up” with “top‐down” approaches for the sustainable management of proglacial landscapes. Finally, we propose establishing a transdisciplinary initiative with policy‐related goals to further dialogues around the governance and sustainable management of proglacial landscapes.

Most research has examined these mechanisms using study confederates rather than close dyads. The existing work on couples has focused on marital conflict; none has examined responses to the spouse’s emotional suffering. To address this, 107 married couples ages 40-86 listened to their partner disclose an upsetting personal memory. Afterward, listeners rated their own and their partner’s emotions and perspective-taking; observers reliably coded listeners’ engagement and disclosers’ emotional intensity. Aging theories offer competing predictions: older listeners may disengage from their partner’s disclosure to avoid experiencing negative emotions. Alternatively, older adults may be more engaged and thus more reactive, given the increased investment in their close relationships. Findings showed that older listeners rated their disclosing partner as less sad compared to younger counterparts (p &lt; .05). However, this effect was attenuated (p = .077) by observed emotional intensity, as older disclosers exhibited less intense emotions. There were no age differences in listeners’ own reactivity, perspective-taking, or observed engagement. Taken together, older adults disclosed with less emotional intensity, consistent with theory. By contrast, older listeners’ ratings were validated by external coders, not driven by positivity biases. Further, older listeners were no more or less engaged or reactive to their spouse’s disclosure than younger listeners. This study highlights a context wherein social and emotional motivations are at odds. Teasing these motivations apart will help us to better understand how social-emotional processes develop across adulthood.","https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/5/Supplement_1/1051/43190180/igab046.3753.pdf",""

However, many of the existing studies on the use of research evidence (URE) have been largely qualitative, and the majority of existing quantitative measures are underdeveloped or were tested in regional or context-dependent settings. We are unaware of any quantitative measures of URE with national policymakers in the US. Aims and objectives:: Explore how to measure URE quantitatively by validating a measure of congressional staff’s attitudes and behaviors regarding URE, the Legislative Use of Research Survey (LURS), and by discussing the lessons learned through administering the survey. Methods:: A 68-item survey was administered to 80 congressional staff to measure their reported research use, value of research, interactions with researchers, general information sources, and research information sources. Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted on each of these five scales. We then trimmed the number of items, based on a combination of poor factor loadings and theoretical rationale, and ran the analyses on the trimmed subscales. Findings:: We substantially improved our model fits for each scale over the original models and all items had acceptable factor loadings with our trimmed 35-item survey. We also describe the unique set of challenges and lessons learned from surveying congressional staff. Discussion and conclusions:: This work contributes to the transdisciplinary field of URE by offering a tool for studying the mechanisms that can bridge research and policy and shedding light into best practices for measuring URE with national policymakers in the US.","https://bristoluniversitypressdigital.com/downloadpdf/journals/evp/17/4/article-p689.xml",""

This recasting is guided by critical realism, focused on theorizing generative mechanisms that produce and shape empirical events. Our theorization is informed by Marxist and Weberian insights into environmental sociology contributions. In this critical realist recasting, the treadmill of production and the treadmill of destruction are conceived of as generative mechanisms. A treadmill refers to a process in which powerful organizations appropriate nature to amass power and capital. These organizations degrade the environment, and they suppress and distort information about the environmental damage they cause. The macrosocial context, the organizations at the center of them, and the elites that command these organizations make these treadmills distinct. A treadmill spans the biophysical and the social/cultural realms. Whereas the biophysical is necessary for the social/cultural realm to exist, it exists independent of human knowledge of this realm. As such, historical contingency and social change are at the center of analysis when studying the waxing, waning, transformation, and demise of treadmills. Adopting a critical realist stance, future theorization and research can and should engage a wide range of theories advanced in environmental sociology. The goal is not to establish the single best unitary theory, but to identify and gain insight into the generative mechanisms that shape and constrain human interactions with the environment.","http://online.ucpress.edu/socdev/article-pdf/7/1/52/455810/sod.2021.7.1.52.pdf",""

New U-Pb ages, juvenile εHf signatures, and trace-element composition data of young zircons from tuffs at two southern Laurentia sites indicate their derivation from a continental arc that was active from ca. 328 to ca. 317 Ma and permit correlation of sedimentary sequences 800 km apart in southern Laurentia. These include the Stanley tuffs in the Ouachita Mountains of southeastern Oklahoma and southwestern Arkansas and the newly discovered Barnett tuff in the subsurface of the Midland Basin in west Texas (USA). The Barnett tuff has a zircon chemical abrasion–isotope dilution–thermal ionization mass spectrometry U-Pb date of 327.8 ± 0.8 Ma, similar to the oldest Stanley tuff in the Ouachita Mountains. Zircon Hf isotope depleted mantle model ages further suggest that the source was a continental arc on basement with both Grenville and Pan-African affinities, pointing to northern Gondwana or peri-Gondwana terranes. The new data link the tuffs to granitoids (326 Ma) of the Maya block in southern Mexico, which was part of northern Gondwana. Correlation of the Stanley-Barnett tuffs across southern Laurentia suggests the likely presence of Mississippian tuffs over a broad region in southern Laurentia, and their usefulness for constraining absolute ages of basin fills and characterizing the Gondwanan arc.","https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-pdf/50/3/266/5547425/g49502.1.pdf",""

The 3D model has 40 degrees of freedom (DOFs) including 34 physical revolute joints and 6 global joints. A multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem is solved by simultaneously maximizing box weight and minimizing the sum of joint torque squares.

Finally, the predicted lifting motion, ground reaction forces, and maximum lifting weight are validated with the experimental data.

Much remains unknown regarding the impact of genetic variation in AHR-driven disease, as past studies have focused on a small number of inbred strains. Recently, the presence of a wide range of interindividual variability amongst humans was reported in response to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), the prototypical ligand of the AHR. In this study, a panel of 14 diverse mouse strains was exposed to TCDD for 10 days to characterize the AHR-mediated response across genetic backgrounds. Responses to TCDD are heavily dependent on genetic background. Although mice carry 1 of 4 Ahr alleles known to impact the affinity to AHR-ligands, we observed significant intra-allelic variability suggesting the presence of novel genetic modifiers of AHR signaling. A regression-based approach was used to scan for genes regulated by the AHR and/or associated with TCDD-induced phenotypes. The approach identified 7 genes, 2 of which are novel, that are likely regulated by the AHR based on association with hepatic TCDD burden (p ≤ .05). Finally, we identified 1 gene, Dio1, which was associated with change in percent body fat across the diverse set of strains (p ≤ .05). Overall, the results in this study exemplify the power of genetics-based approaches in identifying novel genes that are putatively regulated by the AHR.","http://academic.oup.com/toxsci/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/toxsci/kfab032/37737625/kfab032.pdf",""

Materials and Methods: We searched the academic and gray literature. We draw on the experiences of Syrian-American mental health professionals with nine years of experience providing clinical and programmatic mental healthcare in combat settings, siege, internally displaced person camps, and refugee camps. Results: Collaboration with nonprofessional personnel was essential due to the shortage of formally trained mental healthcare professionals in Syria. The use of psychological and diagnostic terms increased stigma, whereas asking about the patient’s identified problem, “suffering,” or “challenges” supported engagement. War-related trauma and horizontal violence commonly affect Syrian children, adolescents, and adults. Resilience and engagement were enhanced by sensitivity to patients’ dignity, religious acceptance, and faith. Conclusions: The Syrian war remains an ongoing public health and humanitarian crisis in which mental healthcare must adapt rapidly to specific needs and resources of the patient and community. Psychiatrists can increase the acceptability and efficacy of their care by being sensitive to Syrian patients’ experiences of horizontal violence, loss of dignity, stigma, worldviews in which religion and faith may be important sources of resilience, and culturally acceptable modes of communication.","http://www.thieme-connect.de/products/ejournals/pdf/10.4103/ajm.ajm_141_20.pdf",""

Stark dissimilarities in the bonding and the crystal structure between the rocksalt IV–VIs and the zincblende III–Vs, however, mandate the development of nucleation and growth protocols to reliably prepare high-quality heterostructures. In this work, we demonstrate a route to single crystal (111)-oriented PbSe epitaxial films on nearly lattice-matched InAs (111)A templates. Without this technique, the high-energy heterovalent interface readily produces two populations of PbSe grains that are rotated 180° in-plane with respect to each other, separated by rotational twin boundaries. We find that a high-temperature surface treatment with the PbSe flux extinguishes one of these interfacial stackings, resulting in single-crystalline films with interfaces that are mediated by a monolayer of distorted PbSe. While very thin PbSe-on-InAs films do not emit light, hinting toward a type-III band alignment, we see strong room temperature photoluminescence from a 1.5 μm thick film with a minority carrier lifetime of 20 ns at low-excitation conditions and bimolecular recombination at high excitation conditions, respectively, even with threading dislocation densities exceeding 108 cm−2. We also note near-complete strain relaxation in these films despite large thermal expansion mismatch to the substrate, with dislocations gliding to relieve strain even at cryogenic temperatures. These results bring to light the exceptional properties of IV-VI semiconductors and the new IV-VI/III-V interfaces for a range of applications in optoelectronics.","http://avs.scitation.org/doi/am-pdf/10.1116/6.0000774",""

To combat fire outbreaks in any region, one must map fire susceptibility with accurate and efficient models. This research mapped fire susceptibility in the forests and rangelands of northeastern Iran’s Golestan Province using new data mining models. Fire effective factors data describing elevation, slope angle, annual mean rainfall, annual mean temperature, wind effect, topographic wetness index (TWI), plan curvature, distance from river, distance to road, and distance to village were obtained from several sources. The relative importance of each variable was determined with a random forest algorithm. Fire susceptibility maps were produced in R 3.3.3 software using GAM, MARS, SVM algorithms and a new ens­emble of the three models: GAM-MARS-SVM. Validation of the four fire susceptibility maps was performed with the area under the curve. Results show that distance from village, annual mean rainfall and elevation were of greatest importance in predicting fire susceptibility. The new GAM-MARS-SVM ensemble model achieved the highest fire susceptibility mapping precision. The fire susceptibility map produced using the GAM-MARS-SVM ensemble model best detected the high fire risk areas in Golestan Province.","https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-209699/v1",""

Experiment 1 examined whether a linear focus or a simultaneous focus on feasibility and originality in the process of first generating ideas and then refining them enhanced the overall quality of ideas. The simultaneous focus resulted in the highest originality and elaboration of ideas. Experiment 2 involved four stages of innovation—generation, selection, and two refinement phases—with a varied order of focus in the two refinement phases. Consistent with a dialectical approach to creativity, an iterative focus on feasibility and originality in the refinement phase was most beneficial in enhancing the quality of the ideas.

This recasting is guided by critical realism, focused on theorizing generative mechanisms that produce and shape empirical events. Our theorization is informed by Marxist and Weberian insights into environmental sociology contributions. In this critical realist recasting, the treadmill of production and the treadmill of destruction are conceived of as generative mechanisms. A treadmill refers to a process in which powerful organizations appropriate nature to amass power and capital. These organizations degrade the environment, and they suppress and distort information about the environmental damage they cause. The macrosocial context, the organizations at the center of them, and the elites that command these organizations make these treadmills distinct. A treadmill spans the biophysical and the social/cultural realms. Whereas the biophysical is necessary for the social/cultural realm to exist, it exists independent of human knowledge of this realm. As such, historical contingency and social change are at the center of analysis when studying the waxing, waning, transformation, and demise of treadmills. Adopting a critical realist stance, future theorization and research can and should engage a wide range of theories advanced in environmental sociology. The goal is not to establish the single best unitary theory, but to identify and gain insight into the generative mechanisms that shape and constrain human interactions with the environment.","http://online.ucpress.edu/socdev/article-pdf/7/1/52/455810/sod.2021.7.1.52.pdf",""

The secondary English language arts (ELA) classroom is situated at the intersection between literary theory and literacy theory, where too often literary theory does not include pedagogical practices and literacy theory does not take disciplinary differences into account. Reynolds and coauthors propose an English Language Arts heuristic for disciplinary literacy to guide teachers toward embracing student-led interpretations. They explore the connections among the Common Core State Standards, New Criticism, and the ELA classroom and focus on the prevalence of interpretive monism, which is the belief that only one interpretation is appropriate for students when reading a literary text. The essay explicates a heuristic for ELA literacy that centers on students actively creating interpretations of and transforming literary texts. By embracing this heuristic, the authors assert, teachers can focus on student-led interpretations of literary texts and thus empower their students.","http://meridian.allenpress.com/her/article-pdf/91/3/382/2905428/i1943-5045-91-3-382.pdf",""

The pattern of PPARγ (P &lt; 0.01) and PPARδ (P &lt; 0.01) expression seemed to mimic that of MHC-I expression, increasing from days 84 to 112. Distribution of MHC-IIA demonstrated a change over time (P = 0.02). Muscle fiber cross-sectional area increased by day (P &lt; 0.01) for each MHC with the notable increase between days 0 and 56. Total nuclei density decreased (P = 0.02) over time. Cells positive for only Myf5 increased (P &lt; 0.01) in density early in the feeding period, then declined, indicating that satellite cells were fusing into fibers. The dual-positive (PAX7+Myf5) nuclei also peaked (P &lt; 0.01) around day 56 then declined. These data indicated that gene expression associated with oxidative proteins may be independent of vitamin A status in yearling cattle.","http://academic.oup.com/jas/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jas/skab075/36508463/skab075.pdf",""

Their decline has been linked to anthropogenic activities, with wildfires being among the most conspicuous agents of habitat alterations affecting native amphibians. In 2011, the most destructive wildfire in Texas history occurred in the Lost Pines ecoregion of central Texas, USA, burning 39% of the 34,400 ha forest and drastically decreasing available habitats for many native wildlife species, including the green tree frog (Hyla cinerea). We investigated use of PVC pipes as artificial refuges for green tree frogs in different habitats within this post-fire pine forest. We monitored green tree frog use of small (diameter 38.1-mm, 1.5 inch) and large (diameter 50.8-mm, 2 inch) pipes located adjacent to, and 5 m from, ponds in burned and unburned areas over a 5-month period. We caught 227 frogs, 101 (24 adults and 77 juveniles) in burned and 126 (61 adults, 63 juveniles, and 2 unknown) in unburned areas. A relationship between pipe use by adults and/or juveniles and pipe location in burned versus unburned areas was found, but pipe use by adults and/or juveniles and pipe size were independent. Pipe use by adults and/or juveniles and pipe size were also independent. Juveniles were more frequently observed in pipes located adjacent to ponds. Our results confirmed that PVC pipes merit consideration as a simple, inexpensive, conservation tool to aid in restoration of green tree frog populations after high-severity wildfires. Such artificial refuges may be particularly important for survival of juveniles in severely altered post-fire habitats.","https://www.mdpi.com/1424-2818/13/12/649/pdf",""

It is very challenging to discover complex spatial-temporal transmission mechanisms. However, it is crucial to capture essential features of regional-temporal patterns of COVID-19 to implement prompt and effective prevention or mitigation interventions. In this work, we develop a novel framework of compatible window-wise dynamic mode decomposition (CwDMD) for nonlinear infectious disease dynamics. The compatible window is a selected representative subdomain of time series data, in which compatibility between spatial and temporal resolutions is established so that DMD can provide meaningful data analysis. A total of four compatible windows have been selected from COVID-19 time-series data from January 20, 2020, to May 10, 2021, in South Korea. The spatiotemporal patterns of these four windows are then analyzed. Several hot and cold spots were identified, their spatial-temporal relationships, and some hidden regional patterns were discovered. Our analysis reveals that the first wave was contained in Daegu and Gyeongbuk area but it spread rapidly to the whole of South Korea after the second wave. Later on, the spatial distribution is seen to become more homogeneous after the third wave. Our analysis also identifies that some patterns are not related to regional relevance. These findings have then been analyzed and associated with the inter-regional and local characteristics of South Korea. Thus, the present study is expected to provide public health officials helpful insights for future regional-temporal specific mitigation plans.","https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-725714/v1",""

Children from lower socioeconomic status (SES) households on average perform below their higher SES peers on word learning tasks, negatively impacting their vocabulary; however, significant variability exists within this group. Many children from low SES homes perform as well as, or better than, their higher SES peers on measures of word learning. The current study addresses what processes underlie this variability, by comparing the neural oscillations of 44 better versus worse word learners (ages 8–15 years) from lower SES households as they infer the meaning of unknown words. Better word learners demonstrated increases in theta and beta power as a word was learned, whereas worse word learners exhibited decreases in alpha power. These group differences in neural oscillatory engagement during word learning indicate there may be different strategies employed based on differences in children’s skills. Notably, children with greater vocabulary knowledge are more likely to exhibit larger beta increases, a strategy that is associated with better word learning. This sheds new light on the mechanisms that support word learning in children from low SES households.","http://direct.mit.edu/nol/article-pdf/doi/10.1162/nol_a_00040/1922942/nol_a_00040.pdf",""

We prime auditors with a forensic perspective and compare their fraud performance to unprimed auditors in both low- and high-risk contexts, finding primed auditors assess fraud-risk significantly higher in all fraud-risk environments. In a high-risk environment, primed auditors propose a more appropriate audit-plan response. Relevant to fraud detection, these audit-plan modifications were consistent with those determined by a panel of audit and forensic experts.

Long-term forecasts and investment recommendations remain similarly biased, alleviating the concern that the documented reduction in bias is a response to broad economic forces. At the individual analyst level, we find that bias reduction is more pronounced among close-to-management analysts, and that more biased analysts respond by reducing their coverage of Estimize firms. The collective evidence suggests that competition from Estimize improves sell-side research quality by discouraging strategic bias.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article-pdf/97/4/287/80559/i1558-7967-97-4-287.pdf",""

Purpose: To examine radiology resident discrepancies as they pertain to a large pediatric hospital system. Material and Methods: A total of 21,560 preliminary reports issued by 39 residents over a one-year period were scored as agreement, minor discrepancy, or major discrepancy by faculty members using a modification of the 2009 RADPEER scoring system. Residents were trainees of three different diagnostic radiology programs: large university-based, medium-sized community-based, or small community-based. Discrepancy rates were evaluated based on resident postgraduate year, program, and imaging modality. The effect of a general pediatric radiology report versus pediatric neuroradiology report of a CT scan was also tested. CT was the only modality in which there were comparable numbers of studies scored by both general pediatric radiologists and neuroradiologists. Results: The rate of major resident to faculty assessment discrepancies was 1.01%, and the rate of minor resident to faculty assessment discrepancies was 4.47%. Major discrepancy rates by postgraduate years 3-5 were 1.08%, 0.75%, and 1.59%, respectively. Major discrepancy rates were highest for MR (11.22%), followed by CT (1.82%), radiographs (0.91%), and ultrasound (0.56%).

One such research stream largely examines Canadian directors' and officers' (D&O) insurance and finds that more coverage (i.e., higher limits) is negatively associated with financial reporting quality and positively related to litigation (accounting-related agency costs). However, the U.S. and Canada differ on key issues relevant to securities litigation and D&O insurance. Thus, we predict and find that premiums, rather than limits, provide information about U.S. accounting-related agency costs. Nonetheless, the incremental information provided by premiums about accounting-related agency costs is limited, and audit fees provide better information about these agency costs. Thus, although researchers argue for disclosure of U.S. D&O insurance information, the usefulness of such disclosures may be limited because audit fees are already disclosed.

Accumulating evidence suggests herbs and spices may improve risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases. In this narrative review, an overview of evidence from human clinical trials examining the effect of herbs and spices on risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases is provided. Human clinical trials examining supplemental doses of individual spices and herbs, or the active compounds, have yielded some evidence showing improvements to lipid and lipoprotein levels, glycemic control, blood pressure, adiposity, inflammation, and oxidative stress. However, cautious interpretation is warranted because of methodological limitations and substantial between-trial heterogeneity in the findings. Evidence from acute studies suggests intake of mixed herbs and spices as part of a high-saturated fat, high-carbohydrate meal reduces postprandial metabolic impairments, including lipemia, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction. Limited studies have examined the postprandial metabolic effects of incorporating mixed herbs and spices into healthy meals, and, to our knowledge, no trials have assessed the effect of longer-term intake of mixed herbs and spices on risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases.

In pSS, patients exhibit exocrine gland dysfunction along with serious systemic disease manifestations. Although Myd88-dependent signaling networks are essential for pSS disease pathogenesis, these pathways remain incompletely understood in the context of pSS. The objective of this study was to establish the contribution of Myd88 activation in immune cells to local and systemic pSS manifestations. To this end, we generated a novel conditional knockout pSS mouse model lacking Myd88 in the hematopoietic compartment. We found that ablation of Myd88 in immune cells altered inflammatory mediators in salivary tissue, but did not affect the degree of lymphocytic infiltration in exocrine glands or salivary production. Nephritis was diminished and pulmonary inflammation was increased in mice lacking Myd88 in hematopoietic cells. Finally, we found total IgM titers and autoreactive IgM and IgG were attenuated in pSS mice lacking Myd88 in immune cells. Thus, we demonstrated that Myd88 activation in the hematopoietic compartment is essential for distinct aspects of disease. This study establishes a rationale for design of targeted therapeutics that modulate Myd88 activation in a tissue-specific manner to ameliorate salivary inflammation and systemic disease manifestations characteristic of pSS.","https://journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article/206/1_Supplement/60.14/238218/Myd88-activation-in-immune-cells-governs-distinct",""

Background: Little is known about the parenting practices of grandparent caregivers, and most extant studies are based on self‐report data rather than direct observations of grandparent–grandchild interactions. Method: Custodial grandmothers ( Results: Controlling for child age, there were no differences in parenting variables between high and low HI groups. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that, controlling for child age, child HI did moderate the relationship between commands given by a grandmother and child compliance, where children lower in HI were more likely than children high in HI symptoms to comply in the face of high levels of commands. In general, however, CGMs were effective in eliciting child compliance. A second hierarchical regression model, also controlling for child age, suggested that for some children, grandmothers’ encouragement and praise (vs. criticism and discouragement) was an effective method of gaining compliance without overrelying on commands. Conclusion: This study revealed complex relationships among positive and negative parenting practices, direct and indirect commands, and compliance.

These harsh operational conditions lead to failures of wind turbines, which are difficult to predict. Consequently, it is challenging to schedule maintenance actions that will avoid failures. In this article, a simulation-driven online maintenance scheduling algorithm for wind farm operational planning is derived. Online scheduling is a suitable framework for this problem since it integrates data that evolve over time into the maintenance scheduling decisions. The computational study presented in this article compares the performance of the simulation-driven online scheduling algorithm against two benchmark algorithms commonly used in practice: scheduled maintenance and condition-based monitoring maintenance. An existing discrete event system specification simulation model was used to test and study the benefits of the proposed algorithm. The computational study demonstrates the importance of avoiding over-simplistic assumptions when making maintenance decisions for wind farms. For instance, most literature assumes maintenance lead times are constant. The computational results show that allowing lead times to be adjusted in an online fashion improves the performance of wind farm operations in terms of the number of turbine failures, availability capacity, and power generation.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/00375497211028605",""

In this study, we use the association between forecast revisions and upcoming news to measure forecast completeness and show that post-forecast-revision drift is higher when forecasts are incomplete. We follow Hui and Yeung’s (2013) approach to separate forecast revision news into industry-wide and firm-specific components because they find that drift is primarily associated with the industry component. We find that forecast revisions are less complete for industry-wide news than for firm-specific news. Furthermore, analysts’ industry-wide revisions are less complete early in the year and when the underlying news is bad, and we find stronger post-forecast-revision drift in those cases. We also show that analysts who were optimistic in prior periods tend to issue forecasts that are less complete and that generate stronger drift than forecasts by other analysts. Our findings provide an explanation for the drift that contrasts with prior studies that attribute the drift to investors’ slow assimilation of the news in forecast revisions. Thus, our study sheds light on analysts’ role in conveying firm-specific and industry-wide news to investors and on the implications for post-forecast-revision drift.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0148558X211043723",""

Next, I consider the weight of the body in experiences of presence in liturgical practices, both in person and virtual, guided again by Gabriel Marcel as well as Bruce Ellis Benson, Emmanuel Falque, Christina Gschwandtner and Éric Palazzo.

We find that following Italy's adoption of IFRS, audit hours (but not the hourly rate) increased, suggesting that audit effort (in audit hours) increased following IFRS adoption. We then examine whether more audit hours are associated with improved audit quality in the IFRS regime. Consistent with prior literature (Caramanis and Lennox 2008), we find that more audit effort is associated with lower abnormal accruals in the period before IFRS adoption. Interestingly, after Italy adopted IFRS, abnormal accruals are lower, but audit hours were less associated with lower abnormal accruals, implying that more audit hours are needed to constrain earnings management. Collectively, our empirical analysis suggests that while audit effort increased with mandatory IFRS adoption, the effectiveness of audit effort to constrain earnings management decreased.","https://publications.aaahq.org/ajpt/article-pdf/40/4/1/51406/i1558-7991-40-4-1.pdf",""

There have been several 3D cell culture techniques developed, which include spheroid and multicellular tissue cultures. Cell spheroids have been generated from single or multiple cell types cultured in ultralow attachment (ULA) well plates and hanging droplet plates. In general, cell spheroids are formed in a relatively short period of culture, in the absence of extracellular matrices (ECMs), via gravity-driven self-aggregation, thus having limited ability to self-organization in layered structure. On the other hand, multicellular tissue cultures including miniature tissues derived from pluripotent stem cells and adult stem cells (a.k.a. ‘organoids’) and 3D bioprinted tissue constructs require biomimetic hydrogels or ECMs and show highly ordered structure due to spontaneous self-organization of cells during differentiation and maturation processes. In this short review article, we summarize traditional methods of spheroid and multicellular tissue cultures as well as their technical challenges, and introduce how droplet-based, miniature 3D bioprinting (‘microarray 3D bioprinting’) can be used to improve assay throughput and reproducibility for high-throughput, predictive screening of compounds. Several platforms including a micropillar chip and a 384-pillar plate developed to facilitate miniature spheroid and tissue cultures via microarray 3D bioprinting are introduced. We excluded microphysiological systems (MPSs) in this article although they are important tissue models to simulate multiorgan interactions.","https://portlandpress.com/essaysbiochem/article-pdf/65/3/481/918409/ebc-2020-0150c.pdf",""

Then, we scored 193 forms using SB-ZOLs and published ZOLs. Compared with the old ZOLs, the updated ZOLs yielded more consistent results with the SB-ZOLs when a 3% cutoff is used for Activity 3. However, the new ZOLs made more improvement in Form A than Form B and in Activity 2 than Activities 1 and 3. Further studies are needed to determine if the inconsistencies stem from cultural differences or the method of updating the ZOLs.

The Satisfaction with Labor Market Participation Survey (SLMP) was administered at two points in time to adults with disabilities. Analyses included a combination of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. A nine-item, two-factor scale emerged from the exploratory factor analysis and was supported by confirmatory factor analysis. All correlations were in the expected direction, and regression analysis with both the SLMP and employment status showed the SLMP significantly predicting satisfaction with life while employment status did not after controlling for the SLMP. Preliminary data support the SLMP as a reliable and valid tool for assessing satisfaction with labor market participation for use with people with disabilities in vocational counseling and employment research.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/00343552211017215",""

This study examined the relation between experiencing the death of an immediate family member and heart rate variability (HRV) and whether the associations differed by sleep quality. The sample included respondents from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) Biomarker Project who reported losing an immediate family member – parents, spouse, siblings, or children – within a year before project (n = 94) and those who did not experience any deaths (n = 872). Results showed that the death of a family member was associated with worse HRV only among those who reported having a poor sleep quality and not for those with good sleep quality. These findings suggest that poor sleep quality may indicate psychophysiological vulnerability for those who experienced the death of an immediate family member.","https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/5/Supplement_1/112/43179053/igab046.430.pdf",""
