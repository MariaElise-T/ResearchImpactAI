However, little research has explored direct relationships between dreaming and objective measures of creativity and the ability to creatively solve problems. Furthermore, personality influences dream recall frequency (DRF) and other aspects of dreaming, suggesting that the relationship between dreaming and creativity may vary based on personality. The goal of the current experiment was to determine if DRF is related to creativity and creative problem-solving, and if these relationships are influenced by personality traits. Methods: Seventy-six participants completed questionnaires about dreaming and the Big 5 personality traits (neuroticism, conscientiousness, openness, extraversion, agreeableness) and completed creativity and creative problem-solving tasks. Two tasks measured creativity. In one task, participants generated as many possible uses for an object as they could in one minute. In the other, they generated novel captions for five cartoons. Creative problem-solving was measured using two classic insight problem sets: the matchstick and compound remote associates tasks. Correlations were conducted to determine if DRF is related to any personality traits and multiple regressions were conducted to determine whether DRF or any personality traits predict creativity or creative problem-solving. Results: DRF was negatively correlated with agreeableness, such that individuals higher in agreeableness recalled fewer dreams. The multiple regression analyses revealed that both DRF and conscientiousness are significant predictors of divergent thinking. Neither DRF nor any personality traits predicted creative problem-solving. Conclusion: These results indicate that agreeableness reduces the frequency of dream recall, perhaps because agreeable individuals try to find problem solutions immediately while awake so they do not worry about them later. Consistent with current theories, frequently recalling dreams increased creativity, suggesting that the exploration of weak or novel relationships during dreaming increases creativity while awake. Conscientiousness also predicted creativity, suggesting that self-sufficient people tend to be more creative. However, frequently recalling dreams did not increase the ability to creatively solve problems. Collectively, these results suggest that personality influences dreaming behaviors and that frequent dreaming and conscientiousness promote creativity.

We conducted a registered replication and extension of Vrij et al., 2012's two experiments, testing whether the reverse order technique increases cues to deception in liars and accuracy in lie detection. Methods: Following Vrij et al., 2012, in Experiment 1, participants were interviewed twice—once lying and once telling the truth—about a mission they completed. In both interviews, participants recounted their experience in chronological and reverse order. We coded interviews for cues to deception according to a cognitive approach: those included in Vrij et al., 2012 (replication) and others included in research on the cognitive load approach (extension). In Experiment 2, participants read two transcripts (replication) or viewed two videos (extension) from Experiment 1 and decided whether senders were lying or telling the truth in continuous (replication) and dichotomous judgements (extension). Results: In Experiment 1, truth tellers were more detailed and plausible than liars. However, we failed to find the interaction between veracity and route recall reported by the original research on the replication or extensions cues. In Experiment 2, we only found an interaction between veracity and route recall for senders telling the truth on dichotomous lie detection judgement. However, this was not supported when examining overall accuracy. Conclusions: These findings do not provide support for the reverse order technique as a tool to improve deception detection. We suggest further theoretical development before this technique is trained to practitioners.","",""

To build an effective yet robust DL-based distress detection model, both the training data and DL model structure need to be carefully prepared. This paper discusses the main influencing factors that affect the performance of DL models in pavement distress detection and aims to explore possible ways to improve the model performance. An open-source pavement image dataset and three promising object detection methods were selected for model development and evaluation. A series of experiments were conducted with different settings of model structures and data manipulation. According to the experiment results, selection of detection methods, data size, and annotation consistency have significant impact on detection performance. DL models YOLO and Faster R-CNN were found to yield the same level of performance, while CenterNet notably underperformed on the test dataset. Distress classes with a larger number of instances were found to be able to yield better performances. With the new annotation data carefully marked up and verified by experienced pavement raters, the accuracy score using the F1 index was found to be 0.84, which was a very sound improvement compared with the 0.7 of the original annotation. Data augmentation methods were found to be able to significantly improve the detection accuracy. Based on the experiment results, we believe the focus should be placed on the development of high-quality training datasets and thin object detection methods in the future.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/03611981231161358",""

One of those experiences uses Microsoft’s HoloLens 2 to introduce students to Augmented Reality (AR). Since AR devices are an emerging technology, the software applications currently available for devices like the HoloLens 2 are not cost-effective for implementing them in most academic courses or labs. To overcome this challenge, the ME program at TXST developed an AR application for the freshman-level lab using the Unity development platform. For that purpose, the CAD model of a product was created using SolidWorks, converted using Blender, and brought into the AR application that was developed.

The model is validated through comparison with experimental data previously published in the literature. Thermal/fluid behaviors and morphological evolution of the molten pool are studied, considering phase transition, recoil pressure, surface tension, and the Marangoni force. The simulation outcomes exhibit the time-varying temperature distribution, fluid dynamics, and surface morphology during the SLS process under different conditions, which helps to identify the impacts of process parameters on the SLS process. The results demonstrate that during the SLS process, the morphology and thermal-fluid dynamics of the molten pool are primarily influenced by the Marangoni force and recoil pressure acting on its surface. Specifically, the recoil pressure at the leading edge of the laser spot plays a crucial role in determining the molten pool’s behavior. The recoil pressure increases exponentially as the temperature rises, causing the liquid metal to move downward and form a depression area at the head of the molten pool, and generates particles that are splashed from the rear edge of the molten pool. The backward Marangoni force, which causes high-temperature liquid at the head of the molten pool to flow towards the cooler liquid at the rear, results in the formation of a vortex that moves the molten pool in the rear region. This study analyzes process parameters such as laser intensity, scan speed, and spot size. The results indicate that increasing laser power and decreasing scanning speed and laser beam spot size can lead to an expansion in both the depth and width of the molten pool.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2023-109482/7238753/v004t04a039-imece2023-109482.pdf",""

Objective: The aim of this project was to explore how a doctoral physical therapy (DPT) program could more accurately represent compliance with HI accreditation requirements by identifying hidden instances of relevant content within the curriculum. Method: This exploratory, mixed methods, action research study utilised document review, questionnaires and interviews in the collection of quantitative and qualitative data to enable assessment of knowledge about HI, to determine if HI content was already incorporated in current courses, and, whether the content was accurately reflected in course student learning objectives (SLOs). Change in faculty understanding of HI as a result of this study was also assessed. Results: Of 16 DPT faculty, 13 participated in the pre-interview questionnaire; 8 (50%) representing 22/39 courses participated in the full study. Most were unfamiliar with HI and had unrecognised HI already incorporated in their courses leading to several SLO revisions and additions. Interview and post-interview questionnaire results documented significant increases in HI understanding among faculty. Conclusion: Physical therapy and HIM collaboration was successful in identifying HI content hiding in plain sight. Results revealed multiple instances of unrecognised HI content across the DPT curriculum.

Therefore, it is critical to establish pathogen surveillance programs with statewide reach and local impact to meet public health needs. The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) partnered with the University of Texas Houston School of Public Health (UTSPH) to create a statewide SARS-CoV-2 variant surveillance monitoring network project (the Network). This Network can be a model for monitoring other emerging pathogens in Texas. Methods: A network was formed among DSHS, six academic centers, two commercial laboratories, and one public health laboratory for high throughput SARS-CoV-2 sample procurement, sequencing, and analysis for Texas. The program developed sample procurement and sequencing capacity across the state and electronic genomic data reporting to DSHS. Partners were selected based on expertise and area of geographic need. Protocols were established to meet high data quality and reporting standards. Working committees and shared data visualization tools were established to ensure collaboration among partners. The steering committee and workgroups were established to support network activities and enable DSHS to monitor epidemiological dynamics and transmissibility and respond to SARS-CoV-2 variants across each public health region. Results: The Network has successfully established a state-wide system for sample collection, whole genome sequencing, reporting and analysis of data. At a regular cadence, the six academic centers acquire SARS-CoV-2 samples, sequence them in their respective labs and report the corresponding sequence or test data to DSHS and UTSPH. As of April 21, 2023, a total of 17,257 samples have been collected (Figure 1) and a total of 14,080 samples have been sequenced (Figure 2). Conclusion: The network of public, academic and private partners has effectively met the need for SARS-CoV-2 sequence surveillance in this large and diverse state. With this established infrastructure in place, expanding to study other emerging pathogens in Texas is feasible.

On day 15, 3 DENS pens were randomly selected and given access to an exercise area (DENS-EX) for 1 hour three times weekly. Negligible forage was available for CON heifers, whereas all heifers received the same limit fed diet which averaged 13 kg/heifer daily of a corn-based diet. Heifer shrunk BW was recorded after 16 h of feed and water withdrawal on days -3 and 225 for average daily gain calculation. On day 0, heifers were fitted with a pedometer behind their shoulder and an ear tag (CowManager, Select Sires, Plain City, OH) to record behavioral responses.

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of CD on intra-articular inflammation, hypothesizing that intra-muscular administration of CD would reduce intra-articular inflammation following an acute inflammatory challenge by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). To test this, 32 yearling Quarter horses were stratified by age (500 ± 13 d), BW (336 ± 26 kg), sex (n = 16 female; n = 16 male) and initial bone optical density into 4 treatment groups. The 140-d study consisted of two phases: Phase 1 (d 0 to 83) and Phase 2 (d 84 to 140) emulated sale preparation and early performance training, respectively. Horses were housed individually (3.6 m × 7.3 m) and fed to meet requirements of growing horses undergoing moderate training. Treatments consisted of control (CON; n = 8; no CD), single-dose (1X; n = 8; d 84), two-doses (2X; n = 8; d 0, 84), and four-doses (4X; n = 8; d 0, 42, 84, 126) of CD. All horses received iso-volumetric intramuscular injections of 1.8mg/kg BW clodronate disodium (OSPHOS) or saline (placebo) on d 0, 42, 84, and 126. Following treatment administration on d 126, radial carpal joints of each horse were injected with 0.8 mL of either 0.5 ng sterile LPS derived from Escherichia coli O55:B5 or sterile lactated Ringer’s solution as a contralateral control. Synovial fluid was collected before LPS injection (h 0) and at 6, 12, 24, and 336 h post injection. Synovial fluid was analyzed using an ELISA for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), an indicator of joint inflammation. Data were log transformed and analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS. There was an h × LPS interaction (P &lt; 0.01) confirming an acute, transient inflammatory response with increased PGE2 at 6, 12, and 24 h compared with the contralateral control joint, and resolved (P = 0.62) by h 336 post-injection. There was a treatment × h × LPS interaction (P = 0.02) in which 1X, 2X and 4X CD groups had greater synovial PGE2 concentrations at 6 h post-injection in the LPS joint compared with CON. In summary, intra-articular LPS induced localized inflammation, and the PGE2 response was greater in all horses treated with CD. The results of this study reject the hypothesis, suggesting clodronate disodium administration does not reduce intra-articular inflammation following acute induced synovitis.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/101/Supplement_3/379/52957883/skad281.450.pdf",""

These salamanders were excavated from compact, rocky soil adjacent to a caliche road, at depths that ranged between ~0.2 to 1.5 m. The dominant vegetation at this site included Ulmus crassifolia, Persicaria sp., and various grass species. We recovered 140 individuals of which seven were salvaged and 133 were captured live. We measured 115 of these for snout–vent length (SVL) and observed the aggregate was predominated by juveniles. We estimated an estivation density of 2.33 sirens/m2 that is comparable to densities estimated for non-estivating populations.

This study examines the differences in talar shape and trabecular bone structure between obese and non‐obese individuals. A sample of 20 obese and 20 non‐obese divided evenly by sex was selected from the Texas State University Donated Skeletal Collection. Tali were imaged using x‐ray computed tomography (voxel size: 28–38.7 μm). Image stacks were processed to produce binary images as well as trabecular thickness and spacing maps. Landmark‐based geometric morphometric analyses were conducted to quantify shape variation. Shape coordinates were used to locate 100 geometrically homologous volumes of interest within each talus. Bone volume fraction, trabecular thickness, and trabecular spacing were extracted at each volume of interest. Within each sex, a one‐way ANCOVA was used to determine if significant differences exist between obese and non‐obese individuals in trabecular bone after controlling for age. The size of the talus as well as subtle aspects of shape were found to distinguish the sexes. The results further indicate that bone volume fraction significantly differs between obese and non‐obese males. In females, bone volume fraction is correlated with age but does not differ between obese and non‐obese. The study demonstrates that bone microstructure is a promising approach to estimating body mass or body mass index category but age effects diminish the potential for the talus to be used alone.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1556-4029.15209",""

Although bisphosphonates are beneficial to treat bone disease, extra-label use in healthy juvenile horses may interfere with normal bone metabolism. The objective was to determine plasma pharmacokinetics of the bisphosphonate clodronate disodium (CD) following a single intramuscular dose to better define the time course of CD in juvenile horses. Ten yearling Quarter Horses (334 ± 18 kg, 504 ± 13 d of age) were used to test the hypothesis that juvenile horses would have faster clearance rate of CD compared with previously published data in adult horses. Horses were placed in individual stalls, jugular intravenous catheters were inserted, and an initial blood sample (0 h) was collected. Horses were administered CD intramuscularly at 1.8 mg/kg BW per label. Plasma samples were collected at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h post-administration. Plasma concentration of clodronate was determined by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using a two-compartment model. Blood chemistry parameters [blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, alkaline phosphatase (ALKP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), and creatine kinase (CK)] were determined via a commercial laboratory. Included blood chemistry parameters were analyzed for an effect of time using PROC Mixed of SAS. Clodronate was detected in plasma up to 72 h post-administration. Maximum plasma concentration (43,971 ± 25,920 ng/mL) was reached at 0.5 h post-administration. Analysis revealed bicompartmental kinetics with distribution and terminal half-lives of 1.9 ± 0.4 h and 24.4 ± 4.3 h, respectively. Area under the curve to last sample was 22,755 ± 11,426 ng*h/mL and extrapolated to infinity was 26,778 ± 12,465 ng*h/mL. Blood chemistry parameters varied over time within normal ranges. Markers of renal function, BUN and creatinine, decreased from h 0 to h 72 (P &lt; 0.01). Liver function markers ALKP and AST were not affected by CD treatment (P &gt; 0.27). However, GGT and CK changed over time (P &lt; 0.01), with GGT greater at 48 h than other time points, and CK increasing from 0.5 to 24 h before decreasing by 72 h but remaining above baseline.

Further, the observed bicompartmental kinetics differed from the linear kinetics previously reported in mature horses whereby juvenile horses from the current study had greater exposure to CD over time as indicated by a longer terminal half-life. Moreover, the single intramuscular dose of CD (1.8 mg/kg BW) did not cause markers of kidney or liver function to deviate from normal ranges in juvenile Quarter Horses.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/101/Supplement_3/407/52958237/skad281.484.pdf",""

The rotation of the sample’s magnetic moment upon application of a field perpendicular to the easy axis was monitored with a biaxial VSM above the PA12’s softening temperature. The observed magnetic moment transients depend on the temperature, the applied alignment field, the packing fraction, and the initial field-anneal procedure. Longer field-anneals result in larger time constants and seem to induce a hurdle that prevents complete alignment at low temperatures and/or for small fields. Results indicate the molten composite is a non-Newtonian fluid that can support a yielding stress. Scanning Electron microscopy (SEM) images taken on field-annealed samples at 230 °C show strong chaining with little PA-12 left between individual Sr-ferrite particles suggesting that direct particle to particle interaction is the reason for the observed non-zero yielding stress. The melt viscosity of the composite increases with the number of thermal cycles above the melting temperature (Tm).

A qualitative case study approach was employed combining semi-structured interviews with faculty and focus-group interviews with graduate students for gaining a deeper understanding of the observables documenting one postgraduate program of educational leadership in Central Texas. The primary expectation of postgraduate students and faculty members is a sense of community. The program reflects a sense of belonging and reality present in local schools, communities, and policy/practice. The meaning of community also includes a common purpose, members committed to a common good, a sense of belonging, and emotional interaction following the COVID surge, the shift to digital technology, and alternative modality of content delivery. This article contributes to the international literature by redefining the quality, value-based, and relational assurance of higher education postgraduate programs. In responding to current conditions and needs while aiming to build sustainable and responsive communities by inviting community members for the assets they bring, their commitment to the region’s development, and further deepen their sense of diversity, inclusion, and collective action for the public good.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/17577438231218376",""

This study addresses the potential for diatoms to enter the bone marrow of skeletal remains, that is, de‐fleshed long bones post‐mortem. In laboratory and field experiments, bones were either inflicted with two access points by a cut and acid pitting or left intact. The bones were submerged in water for at least 1 week and up to 3 months. Samples of the bone surface and marrow were inspected for diatoms. The analysis considered the time required for diatoms to enter marrow and whether genus characteristics like size or mobility affect entry. The presence of an access point influenced diatom entry in that bones without an introduced access point had zero to one diatom present in the marrow, whereas a bone with an access point had >150 diatoms present in the marrow. The results of both laboratory and field phases suggest that diatoms will reliably colonize bone in as quickly as 1 week, establishing and maintaining communities for at least 3 months. However, the bone surface assemblages differ from the source community. Bone marrow displayed even more restrictive access to diatom colonization, resulting in communities dominated by small raphid diatoms. Based on these findings, we suggest some caveats on the use of diatoms as trace evidence in forensic science with recommendations for future avenues of research.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1556-4029.15296",""

However, little is known if pathogen odors can elicit different physiological responses (i.e. behavioral and immune) and how are pathogen odors integrated into different responses in the brain. We hypothesize that pathogen odors not only activate immune responses but also induce avoidance behavior. Moreover, we hypothesized that pathogen olfactory responses are modulated by neurosteroids at different times in different parts of the brain. We used a two-choice maze test to determine whether inactivated Yersinia ruckeri elicits aversive behavior. Furthermore, to check if behavioral and immune responses are modulated by neurosteroids, we performed a second experiment where we nasally administered inactivated Y. ruckeri to rainbow trout. After that, the nose, olfactory bulb, cerebellum, and optic tectum were collected at four different time points (15 min, 4 hours, 24 hours, and 7 days) and samples were extracted to measure gene expression of several steroidogenic enzymes ( cyp19a1, 3βHSD, 11HSD, and 17HSD) and fish production of neurosteroids (e.g. cortisol, estradiol, and progesterone). We found that rainbow trout actively avoids pathogen odors. Moreover, we found a different expression of neuro steroidogenic enzymes at different brain areas and times post-exposure. Fish exposed to pathogen odor express a significant increase (ANOVA 2 factor, P<0.05) of cyp19a1 (involved in estradiol synthesis) as soon as 15 min in the nose and olfactory bulb, and 4 hours post-exposure in the cerebellum and optic tectum. This gene expression was parallel to a significant increase of estradiol in the nose, bulb, and rest of the brain between 15 min and 4 hours. Moreover, there was a significant increase of 11HSD and 17HSD (related to the production of testosterone, cortisol, and corticosterone) 4 hours after exposure in the nose and cerebellum but a significant decrease in the olfactory bulb and optic tectum. These gene expression patterns were parallel o an increase of cortisol in the nose and olfactory bulb. Finally, we found a significant increase of 3βHSD (involved in the first steps of steroidogenesis) after 24 hours in the nose and olfactory bulb, although we didn’t find an increase in steroid production in our preliminary assays. Our results showed that exposure to pathogen odors activates different neuro steroidogenic pathways at different times after exposure, and at different areas of the brain. These findings pinpoint the use of the sense of smell by fish to control behavioral and immune responses to pathogens, with neurosteroids playing a key role in modulating and integrating these olfactory responses.","",""

This method presented here combines elements from previous forensic literature and methods of diatom isolation in phycology to extract diatoms from bone marrow of skeletal remains for forensic use. This diatom extraction method is time‐efficient, minimizes contamination risk, and produces samples of intact diatoms. This method is designed to complete sample preparation within 24 h, sampling the bone for diatoms internally and externally. This method was developed using porcine long bones submerged in water with live diatoms for up to 3 months. Three marrow samples were extracted from each bone so the method was developed using 102 marrow samples. Additionally, 132 surficial bone and environmental samples were collected and prepared during method development. To briefly summarize the method, the bone joints were cut off with an angle grinder in a biosafety hood to expose the marrow, which was removed from the hip, knee, and shaft as separate samples. The marrow was digested with nitric acid at 400°C in glass beakers before being centrifuged with DI water, plated onto microscope slides, and observed with a compound microscope. Observation found good preservation of unbroken diatom cell walls throughout the process.

There are three subcategories within heat transfer. These are convection, conduction, and radiation. Radiation, which is the purpose of our research, deals with electromagnetic waves being emitted as the charges within the particles themselves move. These waves radiate to other surfaces or the atmosphere which transfer thermal energy from which it was generated. Radiation is dependent on several factors, such as shape, and material properties. The goal of this project was to create a model of the temperature and heat losses associated with a typical piping system consisting of different shaped pipes. This would allow improvement in existing systems through the recommendations gathered from our research to increase efficiency and maximize or minimize thermal energy loss depending on the goal of the specific piping system. To do this, an apparatus consisting of three different shaped pipes will have a heated gaseous medium flowing through it, in which the temperature will be recorded, and analyzed. The focal point of the data would be the measured temperature from thermocouples on each shaped pipe. By designing a piping system consistent with those in industry, we can discover more efficient ways to contain and/or utilize thermal energy in productive ways through the use of unconventional geometrical shaped pipes.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2023-109833/7239672/v008t09a032-imece2023-109833.pdf",""

Although evening bat maternity roosts have been studied in other locations, knowledge gaps exist regarding maternity roost site selection on the Gulf Coast of Texas, United States; thus, our objective was to quantify maternity roost characteristics of evening bats in this region. We radiotracked 11 female and subadult evening bats to 9 roosts during June and July 2018 and 2019 captured in San Bernard National Wildlife Refuge (SBNWR). No transmittered bats roosted in SBNWR and instead all roosts were located 3.6–4.5 km from the same capture site, within an 81-ha residential area of a 5,496-ha city. Five of the nine roosts were located in tall, live, live oak trees Quercus virginiana and one roost was in a residential home. Colony size of bats occupying the roosts ranged from 16 to 500+ bats. All evening bats, including those on properties to which we were denied access, stayed in roosts for the full life of the transmitter (5–21 d) and no roost switching occurred. Although evening bats used SBNWR, potentially for foraging, results suggest trees in the residential area provided suitable maternity roost characteristics. A lack of roost switching may suggest a lack of available roost trees in SBNWR and residential areas or the selected roost trees were high quality. We recommend future studies increase sample sizes of evening bat roosts on the Gulf Coast of Texas, as well as assessing roost site selection of evening bats and monitoring bachelor colony and evening bat winter roost ecology.","https://meridian.allenpress.com/jfwm/article-pdf/14/1/163/3233026/i1944-687x-14-1-163.pdf",""

Pastures were randomly assigned to receive daily supplementation with dried distillers grains at 1% of BW with either: 1) Bacillus subtilis ingredient (BOV; 2 g/steer daily of Bovacillus; Chr Hansen A/S, Horsholm, Denmark), or 2) no additive (CON). Cattle received treatments for the duration of the experiment (d 0 to d 90) while housed in pastures containing stockpiled native forage, primarily Cynodon dactylon and Paspalum dilatatum, as well as free-choice access to water and a commercial mineral + vitamin mix not including ionophores.

The search process starts from the innermost layer, and the same layer neighbors enhance Average Recall (AR), while the distant scaling property enhances search speed, maintaining logarithmic complexity scaling. We compare and contrast SG with six state-of-the-art retrieval methods in four deep-descriptor and two classical-descriptor databases, and we show that the SG indexing and search has smaller memory usage (up to four times) and the Mean Average Precision and AR improve up to 8% over state-of-art for all six datasets at five retrieval depths.","https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3755685/v1",""

Yearling heifers (n = 190) were utilized in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. Heifers (n = 98) in the northern region were sourced from South Dakota (SD) while heifers (n = 92) in the southern region were sourced from Texas (TX). After feedlot arrival in each respective region, fecal Salmonella prevalence was determined, and heifers were sorted into 1 of 4 treatments: heifers sourced from SD and finished in SD (SD-SD); heifers sourced from SD and finished in TX (SD-TX); heifers sourced from TX and finished in SD (TX-SD); heifers sourced from TX and finished in TX (TX-TX). Transport for SD-TX and TX-SD heifers occurred on d 0. Fecal, pen, and water scum line (WSL) samples were collected longitudinally throughout the study; hide and subiliac lymph node (SLN) samples were collected at study end (d 78 for heifers finished in TX and d 90 for heifers finished in SD). A treatment × time interaction was observed (P ≤ 0.01) for fecal Salmonella prevalence, with prevalence being greatest for TX-TX and TX-SD heifers before transport. From d 14 through study end, prevalence was greatest for TX-TX and SD-TX heifers compared with SD-SD and TX-SD heifers. The TX-SD heifers had a 72% decrease in Salmonella prevalence from d 1 to harvest, whereas the SD-TX heifers had a 2,200% increase in Salmonella prevalence from d 1 to harvest. Salmonella prevalence on hides were greater (P ≤ 0.01) for heifers finished in TX compared with SD. Salmonella prevalence in SLN tended (P = 0.06) to be greater in TX-TX and SD-TX heifers compared with TX-SD and SD-SD. Fecal E. coli O157:H7 prevalence had a treatment × time interaction (P = 0.04), with SD-TX prevalence being greater than TX-SD on d 56 and SD-SD and TX-TX being intermediate. A treatment × time interaction was observed for fecal trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-resistant and cefotaxime-resistant E. coli O157:H7 prevalence (P ≤ 0.01).

Soils vary widely in texture and density, leading to differences in friability (e.g., the relative ability of particles to be broken apart), which often requires forelimb specializations in digging animals. Kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spp.) dig and occupy burrows, a trait that is essential to their survival. Some Dipodomys species are restricted to particular substrates that presumably require species-specific forelimb traits. Here we examined the forelimb morphology and soil substrates inhabited by range-restricted and widely ranging Dipodomys species to explore the variation in soil usage, forelimb specializations, and the relationship between these traits. We assessed size and shape traits of preserved specimen forelimb bones using traditional and geometric morphometric techniques and extracted soil data associated with the collecting locality of each specimen. We expected species that inhabit dense soil substrates to display specialized forelimb morphology typified by an elongated scapula and robust humerus, radius, and ulna. The species differed substantially in their soil associations and forelimb morphologies. In particular, forelimb traits that enhance mechanical digging ability were detected in D. elator, a range-restricted species that inhabits dense clay-rich soils. These findings suggest that Dipodomys species that inhabit dense substrates may require correspondingly specialized forelimb morphology and that these traits may limit the desirable geographic ranges inhabited by these species. This may provide important information when making conservation decisions given that unlike other habitat features, soil substrates cannot be easily modified to suit the needs of the organism.","https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article-pdf/104/6/1377/54023117/gyad092.pdf",""

Seventy-two non-lactating, pregnant Angus cows [initial body weight (BW) = 637 ± 13 kg; body condition score (BCS) = 5.5 ± 0.07; and age = 6.1 ± 0.57; exposed to AI = 54 and Bull = 18] were selected and assigned to this experiment at the end of their second trimester of gestation. Before beginning treatment application (d-10), cows were ranked by BW and BCS and allocated (d 0) to 1,000 acres pasture. At this time, cows were assigned to receive supplements containing 1 of 3 treatments: 1) Cu, Mn, and Zn sulfate trace mineral source (INR; n = 24), 2) Cu, Mn, and Zn organic trace mineral source (ORG; n = 24), and 3) Cu, Mn, and Zn hydroxychloride trace mineral source (HXD; n= 24). Cows were fed individually three times a week, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Cow full BW and BCS were recorded before the beginning of the experiment (d -11 and -10). On d -10 and at birth, liver biopsies were performed in all cows and calves via needle biopsy. After calving, cow-calf pairs were assigned to the general herd management, including inorganic mineral supplementation. Calves were weaned at 6 months of age and backgrounded for 85 d. No differences were detected (P ≥ 0.17) among HDX, INR, and ORG cows for initial liver concentrations of trace minerals. At calving, no differences were observed (P ≥ 0.25) in liver concentrations of Se, Co, Cu, Mn, and Zn. There were no differences (P ≥ 0.81) in calf birth BW, crow to rump, and hearth girth measurements between treatments. No treatment effect was observed (P ≥ 0.35) on the liver concentration of calves born to cows receiving treatment.

Originally, ParSe was designed to test the hypothesis that, for flexible proteins, phase separation potential is correlated to hydrodynamic size. While our results were consistent with that idea, we also found that many different descriptors could successfully differentiate between three classes of protein regions: folded, intrinsically disordered, and phase‐separating intrinsically disordered. Consequently, numerous combinations of amino acid property scales can be used to make robust predictions of protein phase separation. Built from that finding, ParSe 2.0 uses an optimal set of property scales to predict domain‐level organization and compute a sequence‐based prediction of phase separation potential. The algorithm is fast enough to scan the whole of the human proteome in minutes on a single computer and is equally or more accurate than other published predictors in identifying proteins and regions within proteins that drive phase separation.

Resistin is located in monocytes and macrophages of adipose tissue. This adipocytokine is an important link between obesity, inflammation, insulin resistance, and cancer risk. Pathways that resistin is known to be involved include but are not limited to mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK). The ERK pathway promotes cellular proliferation, migration, survival of cancer cells, and tumor progression. The Akt pathway is known to be up-regulated in many cancers including liver cancer. Methods: Using an Results: The inhibition of kinase signaling suppressed resistin-induced invasion and lactate dehydrogenase in both cell lines. In addition, in SNU-449 cells, resistin increased proliferation, ROS, and MMP-9 activity. Inhibition of PI3K and ERK decreased phosphorylated Akt and ERK, and pyruvate dehydrogenase. Conclusions: In this study, we describe the effect of Akt and ERK inhibitors to determine if inhibition suppresses resistin-induced liver cancer progression.

By 2050, this number is expected to rise to 152 million—which is slightly larger than the country of Russia. About 90% of these people are over the age of 65, but early-onset dementia can occur at younger ages. Early detection is imperative to expedient treatment, which can improve outcomes over the span of diagnosis. Objectives: To conduct a meta-analysis of similar studies along with a systematic literature review to hasten the development of clinical practice guidelines to assist clinicians in the diagnosis of AD. We analyzed data points in each article published over the last 10 years to meet this objective: cost, efficiency, accuracy, acceptability (by physician and patient), patient satisfaction, and barriers to adoption. Methods: Four research databases were queried (PubMed, CINAHL Ultimate, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect). The review was conducted in accordance with a published protocol, the Kruse Protocol, and reported in accordance with PRISMA (2020). Results: Ten interventions were identified to help diagnose AD among older patients, and some involved a combination of methods (such as MRI and PET). The average sample size was 320.32 (SD = 437.51). These 10 interventions were identified as accurate, non-invasive, non-stressful, inexpensive, convenient, and rapid. Only one intervention was identified as statistically ineffective, and this same intervention was used effectively in other studies. The barriers identified were cost, training, expense of travel, and required physical presence of patient. The weighted average sensitivity was 85.16%, specificity was 88.53, and the weighted average effect size was 0.7339 (medium). Conclusion: Innovation can accurately diagnose AD, but not all methods are successful. Providers must ensure they have the proper training and familiarity with these interventions to ensure accuracy in diagnosis. While the physical presence of the patient is often required, many interventions are non-invasive, non-stressful, and relatively inexpensive.","https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/11/23/3013/pdf",""

However, to be viable as feed, insects must be mass-reared in a ‘mini-livestock’ system. As these mass-rearing systems are relatively new, industry standards and welfare regulations are not yet in place, leaving insect welfare-related questions open. Given the importance of consumer attitudes to the social legitimacy of insect production, an analysis of consumers’ ethical perceptions of producing insects as livestock feed is warranted. The objectives of this study were to: (1) determine if US consumers support or oppose using insects as livestock feed, (2) determine if perceptions regarding insect welfare or ethics are reasons for opposition, and (3) identify US consumers’ perceived risks and benefits of using insects as livestock feed. We developed a quantitative electronic questionnaire-based survey and established reliability and validity prior to distribution. Distribution was achieved through convenience sampling to adult US consumers (n = 361). When asked if insects should be used as livestock feed, 34% of respondents were supportive, 52% were neutral, and 15% were opposed. Of those who were opposed (n = 53), 58% cited ethical concerns as their reason for opposition. Of respondents who were supportive or neutral towards using insects as livestock feed (n = 308), 29% reported livestock welfare and 26% reported insect welfare as perceived risks. Perceived benefits emphasised environmental sustainability. From our entire sample, 74% of respondents thought insects could feel pain, 23% did not know, and 4% did not think insects could feel pain.

The precise mechanisms underlying Retriever assembly and its interaction with CCC have remained elusive. Here, we present the first high-resolution structure of Retriever determined using cryogenic electron microscopy. The structure reveals a unique assembly mechanism, distinguishing it from its remotely related paralog, Retromer. By combining AlphaFold predictions and biochemical, cellular, and proteomic analyses, we further elucidate the structural organization of the entire Retriever-CCC complex and uncover how cancer-associated mutations disrupt complex formation and impair membrane protein homeostasis.

Fusobacterium necrophorum has traditionally been considered the primary etiologic agent of LA formation in cattle, but recent evidence has demonstrated that LA microbial communities are far more polymicrobial than previously believed. Here, we characterize microbial communities within multiple LAs from the same animal, provide evidence that some LAs may be seeded from the hindgut, identify biomarkers throughout the gut-liver axis that predict the presence of LAs, and demonstrate the impact of tylosin on microbial communities in the rumen, ileum, and colon. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to characterize communities from LA purulent material, as well as from the luminal and epithelia, communities in three gut locations (rumen, ileum, colon) within the same animals. A combination of QIIME2 and phyloseq were used to analyze sequence data, and microbial community composition was compared based on generalized UniFrac distances. Taxa discriminant of LA occurrence were identified using linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe). Despite being the most abundant genus when averaged across all LA communities, Fusobacterium spp. was not the predominant taxa in the majority of LAs. In fact, members of Bacteriodetes (largely Bacteroides, Porphyromonas) were the predominant taxa in more than one-half of all LA communities. Importantly, multiple LAs from the same animal had remarkably similar community structure, and multiple taxa including Bifidobacterium spp., widely considered beneficial to gut barrier function in humans, were differentially abundant in both the foregut and hindgut between cattle that did and did not have LAs. Further, tylosin had little impact on the diversity and composition of microbial communities within LAs but did alter communities in the rumen and small intestine. In particular, members of the family Lachnospiraceae were more abundant in the rumen and hindgut of animals given tylosin. Together, these results provide additional evidence challenging the traditional theory of LA etiology (that bacterial translocation occurs exclusively from the rumen) and provides evidence that barrier dysfunction in the gut may be the underlying cause of LA formation.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/101/Supplement_3/70/52957294/skad281.084.pdf",""

Cows and heifers (n = 657) from 10 herds in three states were grouped by days postpartum and age, and randomly assigned to one of two protocols. Cows and heifers assigned to the 6 d protocol were administered prostaglandin F2α (PGF) on d-9, CIDR insertion and administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH1) on d -6, and CIDR removal and PGF administration on d 0. Cows and heifers that were assigned to the 6-d protocol were subsequently grouped into three treatments based on presence and/or timing of estrus and insemination (PG1: Insemination before CIDR insertion, n = 136; PG2: Insemination after CIDR removal, n = 26; T6: Insemination at TAI, n = 166). Cows and heifers assigned to the 7-d protocol (T7: Insemination at FTAI, n = 329) were administered GnRH1 and CIDR insertion on d -7, followed by CIDR removal and PGF administration on d 0. For all animals, FTAI and GnRH2 administration occurred at 54 h (heifers) or 66 h (cows) after CIDR removal. Pregnancy was determined from d 30 to d 40 after FTAI by transrectal ultrasonography. Total cost and profit per pregnancy was calculated for herds of 30, 100, 300, and 500 females with varying estrus response and pregnancy rates. Expenditures were calculated assuming synchronization costs (PG1 = $46.15, PG2 = $75.05, T6 = $77.91, T7 = $73.72), general labor cost considering herd size and handling days, as well as estrus detection labor cost assuming $10.00 per h, a 95% overall herd pregnancy rate, a 1:40 bull:cow ratio, and average bull purchase price of $3,000.00. Revenue was estimated assuming a maximum 205-d weaning age, 1.09 kg/d gain, $200.00/45.4 kg, and 85% weaning rate. Differences in estrus response and pregnancy rate were determined using the GLIMMIX procedure of SAS (v9.4), including herd as a random variable. Estrus response was greater (P &lt; 0.0001) in females assigned to the 6d (73 ± 4%) compared with the 7d (53 ± 4%) protocol; however, pregnancy success was similar among treatment groups (P = 0.32; PG1 = 45 ± 4%, PG2 = 58 ± 10%, T6 = 46±4%, T7 = 52±3%). At the observed estrus response and pregnancy rate for each treatment group, the 6d protocol resulted in a decreased cost per pregnancy compared with the 7d protocol [Table 1; herds of: 30 = ($3.53), 100 = ($5.16), 300 = ($6.58), 500 = ($7.00) females]. Additionally, using the same variables, the 6d protocol resulted in an increased profit per pregnancy compared with the 7d protocol (herds of: 30 = $3.50, 100 = $6.41, 300 = $17.27, 500 = $12.06 females). These results suggest that labor associated with estrus detection may be offset by the proportion of calves subsequently born earlier within the calving season, allowing for improvements to profitability, especially in larger herds.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/101/Supplement_3/87/52957447/skad281.104.pdf",""

We report on the role of thermally cracked H in increasing Sn incorporation by 6x–9.5x, restoring up to 71% of the lost Sn, and attribute this increase to removal of Br from the growth surface as HBr prior to formation of volatile groups such as SnBr4. Furthermore, as the H flux is increased, Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy reveals a monotonic increase in both Sn and carbon incorporation. X-ray diffraction reveals tensile-strained films that are pseudomorphic with the substrate. Raman spectroscopy suggests substitutional C incorporation; both x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman suggest a lack of graphitic carbon or its other phases. For the lowest growth temperatures, scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals nanovoids that may account for the low Sn substitutional fraction in those layers. Conversely, the sample grown at high temperatures displayed abrupt interfaces, notably devoid of any voids, tin, or carbon-rich clusters.

Passive and hybrid cooling techniques that consist of heat pipes (HPs) and fins integrated with a phase change material (PCM) are investigated. The experimental setup consists of a vertically oriented cylindrical enclosure with an inner and outer housing. The annulus space between the inner and outer housings are occupied with a PCM, Fin-PCM, and HP-Fin-PCM and are enumerated as PCM-only, Fin-PCM, and HP-Fin-PCM configurations, respectively. A cartridge heater is inserted inside the inner housing concentrically to generate a pseudo battery, which mimics the heat generated by the battery. An air flow channel is designed for HP-Fin-PCM configuration. Temperatures at various locations of the setups are measured and compared for different heater powers. It is concluded that the HP-Fin-PCM configuration is the most effective in reducing the battery surface temperature, followed by the Fin-PCM, and the PCM-only configuration. A transient three-dimensional numerical model using ANSYS-FLUENT software is also developed and used to provide details into the physics of the problem, and to enable optimization studies.

Trait‐based approaches have long been used to better identify and examine ecological patterns. Most recent studies of riverine metacommunities examining trait‐based patterns have focused on shorter lived organisms. Here we focused on a group of longer lived, sedentary riverine organisms, unionid freshwater mussels. The objective of this study was to examine how (1) the distribution of mussels with different life history strategies (trait‐based approach) and (2) the relative importance of environmental and spatial factors (as a proxy for dispersal) would differ with spatial scale and position in the river; and to (3) further compare this with patterns derived from a taxonomic approach. Fine‐scale distribution data of mussels and environmental factors were collected every 100 m in spatially extensive surveys in an upstream and downstream segment (200 sites/20‐km segment) of a semiarid river, making them some of the most spatially intensive surveys documented to date. A combination of redundancy analysis, asymmetric eigenvector mapping, and variation partitioning analyses revealed that more variation was explained by environmental factors where more environmental differences occur between sites. Where environmental heterogeneity was lower, the amount of variation explained by smaller scale spatial factors was higher, likely mostly associated with stochastic rather than dispersal processes. A higher amount of unexplained variation at the taxonomic level suggests that stochasticity may also play an important role in determining species composition. In contrast, different life history groups had a highly predictable distribution pattern driven by environmental heterogeneity, especially between river segments and mesohabitat, which was associated with different flow conditions. The role we predict for environmental heterogeneity and stochasticity in shaping the distribution of mussels in our study river likely also applies to other taxa and ecosystems at a spatial scale at which neither dispersal limitation nor mass effects occur. Thus, understanding the magnitude and extent of dispersal relative to the amount of environmental heterogeneity may be key for predicting metacommunity structure and dynamics for different organisms.","https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ecs2.4533",""

Despite the availability of a growing number of climate model outputs and the continual development of their process representations, considerable uncertainty cannot be eliminated from their future climate projections. This circumstance, combined with other variables, e.g., time and computing limitations, necessitates the selection of appropriate representative GCM-runs (RGCM-runs), reflecting the past and projected future climate, to assess the effects of climate change on different infrastructures. This study is undertaken to select RGCM-runs for Western North America (WNA) based on their ability to simulate past climates between 1981 and 2005 and climatic changes between two 30-year periods, 2071–2100 and 1981–2010, under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs) scenarios, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. GCMs and their various runs are independently treated as standalone potentials in the selection process, and the initial pool (i.e., full-set) for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 include 105 and 77 GCM-runs, respectively. We examine GCM-runs reduction by evaluating RGCM-runs performance on three criteria: (i) capturing changes in the climatology of monthly mean precipitation and air temperature, (ii) capturing changes in the monthly mean extreme indices, and (iii) matching the historical and reference datasets (i.e., history matching). For the first two criteria, we employ an envelope-based selection technique, and for the last criterion, gleaning the final RGCM-runs, we present a multi-objective distance-based approach comparing the GCM-runs to reference data sets (i.e., monthly average of temperature and precipitation). This framework selects four RGCM-runs for each RCP to represent the full-set and capture the full range of climatic conditions, including wet-warm, wet-cold, dry-warm, and dry-cold scenarios, which represent the extremes of the climatic spectrum. The results demonstrate that the RGCM-runs can simulate previous climatic conditions and projected changes in key climate variables in WNA, such as temperature and precipitation. This indicates that the selected RGCM-runs are suitable for conducting climate impact assessments and developing adaptation plans for the WNA region.","https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2698287/v1",""

SFPT is comprised of specific play therapy skills and techniques that are developmentally appropriate for all ages of children, with an emphasis on nondirective skills for younger children and more directive skills as children gain cognitive and verbal abilities. As a strengths-based theoretical modality, SFPT focuses on identifying small, measurable goals, and then working with the child to identify skills and strategies that can help them reach their goals. This article will review the history, evidence base, and foundations of SFPT, the solution-building process, and SFPT basic skills, techniques, and interventions. This article serves as an overview of the SFPT approach and underscores why this approach should be recognized in the play therapy field.","",""

Specifically, we explore how interim CEOs affect corporate tax avoidance. We match each “interim CEO firm” (test firms) with a “direct-succession CEO firm” (control firms) and find that test firms report significantly and economically lower tax avoidance. We also find that test firms’ pre-tax earnings are similar to those of control firms, but their after-tax earnings are significantly lower. Further, we find that this lower tax avoidance holds only when interim appointees have low equity compensation, are not named as permanent/successor CEOs, and have no CFO background. Our paper opens the door for future investigation of the economic impact of interim CEOs, which has been under-investigated by prior studies.","https://publications.aaahq.org/jata/article-pdf/45/2/147/98427/i0198-9073-45-2-147.pdf",""

Although an extensive literature examines cash holdings in for-profit firms, few accounting studies address the determinants and consequences of cash reserves in nonprofits (Core et al., 2006). This study investigates whether corporate governance mechanisms, which are designed to limit managers’ opportunistic behavior, are associated with nonprofit managers’ ability to build cash reserves. It also examines how excessive cash reserves influence donors’ decisions to contribute to a charity. Results indicate that cash reserves are positively associated with three proxies for corporate governance (board size, board independence, and board monitoring activities). We also find that excessive cash holdings are negatively associated with future donations, after controlling for governance. Our results suggest that donors withhold contributions from charities that are likely to hold their donations for future use rather than deploy them in the current period. This study contributes to research addressing the role of governance in controlling nonprofit managers’ actions and provides new evidence on factors affecting donors’ giving decisions.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0148558X221142953",""

Understanding how calves learn to eat out of a bunk will facilitate the implementation of management practices that expedite this process and allow animal managers to exploit this information to monitor individual animal health. To address this knowledge gap, the feeding behavior of high-risk steers that were received for backgrounding was quantified and characterized using electronic feedbunks in this context. To create this paradigm, crossbred steers (n = 20) were purchased in two groups (Group: n = 64 steers; Group 2: n = 56 steers) from a local auction market, transported 800 km to the Prairie Research Unit in Prairie, MS, and immediately weighed (shrunk body weight, BW). Steers were purchased according to research unit space availability. Therefore, purchases occurred 133 days apart. The subsequent day, steers were ranked by shrunk BW (227 ±.3 kg) and allocated to 1 of 8 drylot pens (n = 8 steers/pen) with two GrowSafe automated feeding systems per pen. Steers were fed a total mixed ration ad libitum for a 28-day period and steer BW was recorded on d 0, 2, 6, 10, 13, 21 and 28. Daily feeding behavior [e.g., meal duration (sec), intake (g/d), meal frequency (count/d), bunk visit frequency (count/d), head down duration (sec), maximum non-feeding interval (NFI,s), ratio of head down duration to bunk visit duration)] were calculated using Meal Criterion Calculation Software. The impact of time on feeding behavior and performance was analyzed using a mixed linear model (PROC MIXED). To determine when steers had established consistent dry matter intake (DMI), consistency was defined as when the DMI of a steer remained within one standard deviation of the 7-day average DMI of the steer. Latency to first bunk attendance (d), first feed consumption, attainment of NEm requirement, and latency (d) to establish consistent feed intake levels were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model (PROC GLIMMIX) for binomial data. Steer BW increased across days (P &lt; 0.01), whereas average daily gain was.48 ± 0.4 kg/d. All feeding behaviors changed across days (P &lt; 0.01). Meal and bunk visit (duration and frequency), meal intake (mean and sum), head down duration, and maximum NFI increased over time. All steers visited the bunk and consumed their first meal by day 4 (P &lt; 0.01). All steers achieved NEm requirements by day11 (P &lt; 0.01). These results quantify the acclimation period of steers to a new environment and characterizes the learning and development of novel modes of eating. These results inform the development of behavioral expectations for newly received high-risk calves that can be used to monitor cattle health, understand cattle perception, and promote cattle welfare.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/101/Supplement_1/85/50196379/skad068.101.pdf",""

Seventy-nine (n = 79) subjects performed either slow breathing method 1 (SB1), slow breathing method 2 (SB2), or normal breathing (control) for five minutes, both pre- and post-VR-ASD.

Varying the mixing ratio of indium tin oxide nanocrystals with different dopant concentrations, we use large-scale simulations to predict the emergence of a broad infrared spectral region with near-zero permittivity. Experimentally, tunable reflectance and absorption bands are observed owing to in- and out-of-plane collective resonances. These spectral features and the predicted strong near-field enhancement establish this multiscale doping strategy as a powerful new approach to designing metamaterials for optical applications.","https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/649af52a6e1c4c986b6cd8a5/original/hierarchically-doped-plasmonic-nanocrystal-metamaterials.pdf",""

Various factors, such as floor surface conditions and contaminants, shoe tread patterns, and gait behavior, affect the slip risk. Moreover, the friction between the shoe outsoles and the floor continuously changes as their surfaces undergo normal wear over time. However, continuous assessment of slip resistance is very challenging with conventional measurement techniques. This study addresses this challenge by introducing a novel approach that combines sensor fusion technology and machine learning techniques to create intelligent insoles designed for fall risk prediction. In addition, a state-of-the-art slip simulator, capable of mimicking the foot’s motion during a slip, was developed and utilized for the assessment of slipperiness between various shoes and floor surfaces. Data acquisition involved the collection of pressure data and three-axial accelerations using instrumented shoe insoles, complemented by friction coefficient measurements via the slip simulator. The collected dataset includes four types of shoes, three floor surfaces, and four surface conditions, including dry, wet, soapy, and oily. After preprocessing of the collected dataset, the simulator was used to train five different machine learning algorithms for slip risk classification. The trained algorithms provided promising results for slip risk prediction for different conditions, offering the potential to be employed in real-time slip risk prediction and safety enhancement.","https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/12/21/4393/pdf",""

Recent reports suggest that this methodology is impacted by the location of an MSNA burst relative to the average resting blood pressure. The current study examined age differences in MSNA burst dispersion around the average MAP and its potential impact on sympathetic transduction. We hypothesized that aging would be associated with more MSNA bursts occurring at MAP values above mean resting MAP, contributing in part to reductions in sympathetic transduction. Beat-to-beat blood pressure and MSNA were recorded during 5-minute supine rest in 27 young (YA; 13F, age: 25±1 yrs, BMI: 25±1 kg/m2) and 26 older (OA; 15F, age: 59±1 yrs, BMI: 26±1 kg/m2) adults. Resting beat-to-beat MAP values were split into low (T1), middle (T2), and high (T3) tertiles, and transduction of bursts occurring within each tertile was calculated using signal-averaging. OA exhibited higher resting MSNA burst frequency (YA: 24±2 vs. OA: 33±2 bursts/min, P<.001). OA exhibited blunted overall sympathetic transduction (YA: Δ1.5±0.1 vs. OA: Δ0.9±0.1 mmHg, P=.005). When separated by MAP tertiles, age differences in transduction were only observed in T3 (YA: Δ-0.4±0.1 vs. OA: Δ-1.0±0.1 mmHg, P=.005) but not T1 (YA: Δ2.3±0.1 vs. OA: Δ2.2±0.2 mmHg, P=.456) or T2 (YA: Δ0.7±0.1 vs. OA: Δ0.4±0.1 mmHg, P=.337). Since age differences were only observed at T3, we next examined only bursts occurring above the average MAP. A greater proportion of bursts occurred above the average MAP in OA (YA: 30±2 vs. OA: 40±1 %, P<.001), and a larger proportion of these bursts were associated with a depressor response in OA (65±2%) compared to YA (56±2%, P=.005). Nevertheless, assessment of bursts occurring above the average MAP that were associated with a pressor response revealed a blunted transduction in OA (YA: Δ2.7±0.3 vs. OA: Δ1.7±0.2 mmHg, P=.016). These results indicate an age-related increase in MSNA burst occurrence above the average resting MAP, with a greater majority of these bursts being associated with depressor responses in OA. Further, age-associated reductions in transduction are observed following MSNA bursts associated with a pressor response occurring above the average resting MAP.","",""

However, a critical knowledge gap exists in terms of the extent to which socio-spatial networks shaped by human mobility exacerbate or alleviate urban heat exposures of populations in cities. In this study, we utilize location-based data to construct human mobility networks in twenty metropolitan areas in the U.S. The human mobility networks are analyzed in conjunction with the urban heat characteristics of spatial areas. We identify areas with high and low urban heat exposure and evaluate visitation patterns of populations residing in high and low urban heat areas to other spatial areas with similar and dissimilar urban heat exposure. The results reveal the presence of urban heat traps in the majority of the studied metropolitan areas in which populations residing in high heat exposure areas primarily visit areas with high heat exposure. The results also show a small percentage of human mobility to produce urban heat escalate (visitations from low heat areas to high heat areas) and heat escapes (movements from high heat areas to low heat areas). The findings from this study provide a better understanding of urban heat exposure in cities based on patterns of human mobility. These finding contribute to a broader understanding of the intersection of human network dynamics and environmental hazard exposures in cities to inform more integrated urban design and planning to promote health and sustainability.","https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3011377/v1",""

Despite high response rates to these combination therapies, most patients succumb to the disease due to relapse and/or drug resistance, providing an unmet clinical need for novel therapies to improve AML patient survival. ME-344 is a potent isoflavone with demonstrated inhibitory activity toward oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and clinical activity in solid tumors. Given that OXPHOS inhibition enhances VEN antileukemic activity against AML, we hypothesized that ME-344 could enhance the anti-AML activity of VEN. Here we report that ME-344 synergized with VEN to target AML cell lines and primary patient samples while sparing normal hematopoietic cells. Cooperative suppression of OXPHOS was detected in a subset of AML cell lines and primary patient samples. Metabolomics analysis revealed a significant reduction of purine biosynthesis metabolites by ME-344. Further, lometrexol, an inhibitor of purine biosynthesis, synergistically enhanced VEN-induced apoptosis in AML cell lines. Interestingly, AML cells with acquired resistance to AraC showed significantly increased purine biosynthesis metabolites and sensitivities to ME-344. Furthermore, synergy between ME-344 and VEN was preserved in these AraC-resistant AML cells. These results translated into significantly prolonged survival upon combination of ME-344 and VEN in NSGS mice bearing parental or AraC-resistant MV4-11 leukemia. This study demonstrates that ME-344 enhances VEN antileukemic activity against preclinical models of AML by suppressing OXPHOS and/or purine biosynthesis.","https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2843025/v1",""

Stage models (e.g., Reisberg and associates FAST and GDS) of AD clarify how changes through time occur using stage markers. Yet the disease is non-linear. Persons with AD don’t travel neatly in stages but fluctuate in recall of names, faces and events. They migrate in a non-linear downward spiral fluctuating back and forth through time, revisiting people, places, events and traumas of their distant past. Time Travel apps and other life history data are available to provide real person-centered care that’s time appropriate. Families are trained to connect in the approximate time frame in which the person has traveled. Hence, care partners are taught time appropriate communication and interventions (e.g., activities, pictures, music etc.) to respond to challenging behaviors.

The survey instrument was constructed to allow open-ended responses as well as 5-point Likert scale questions regarding participants views about infrastructure (IF) and thereby learn what members closest to the animal sciences community perceive to be the strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for improvement in our research infrastructure. Analysis of coded responses in the open-ended questions among varied disciplinary arenas within AS revealed ‘facilities’ as the largest Grand Challenge. About 98% of respondents affirmed sustainable food and animal production is a critical national asset in terms of economic growth and development and 98% indicated an overlooked maintenance of IF in AS undermines national food security. Additionally, 68% indicated the state of core labs, at least for AS programs are only average or below. All respondents (100%) agreed that without comprehensive investment in infrastructure within AS, the USA will continue to fall behind in competing with other countries in areas of research. Study results provided insight into potential consequences of deferred maintenance which should elevate awareness of urgency to address the deficiencies. Since IF needs included future workforce development and working environments, an eroded IF and consequences of deferred maintenance threatens the capacity of AS to pursue Grand Challenges in research and ability to create future workforce readiness of graduates from AS programs.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/101/Supplement_3/121/52957097/skad281.150.pdf",""

Holstein steers (n = 40; initial BW = 84.9 + 7.1 kg) were individually housed and randomly assigned to either a negative control diet (CON), an acidotic diet (AD), or an acidotic diet plus intraruminal inoculation with the bacterial mixture [ADB; (1 × 109 colony forming unit (CFU)/mL of each bacteria]. Steers in AD and ADB were cycled on (3 d) and off (2 d) a high-starch diet 20 days before intraruminal inoculation of ADB. Following inoculation, AD and ADB remained on the acidotic diet for the remainder of the study. Ruminal pH boluses were randomly inserted into 19 steers across treatments to monitor ruminal pH throughout the study. Steers were euthanized and necropsied to record gross pathology on the lung, rumen, liver, and colon. Culture techniques were used to determine the prevalence inoculated bacteria within LA. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction methods were used to quantify F. necrophorum in rumen tissue. Data were analyzed as a completely randomized design with animal as the experimental unit, where an α of ≤ 0.05 determined significance. Liver abscess prevalence was 43% in ADB vs. 0% in AD and CON treatments (P &lt; 0.01). Ruminal damage was 51.1% greater in ADB than in AD and 78.6% greater than in CON (P ≤ 0.05). There were no pathological differences in the lungs and colons among treatment groups (P ≥ 0.14). There was a treatment × time interaction for ruminal pH, where pH decreased below 5.6 in AD and ADB calves during each cycle of the acidotic diet (P &lt; 0.01). The ADB contained a greater concentration of F. necrophorum subsp. Necrophorum and subsp. Fundliforme within rumen tissue (P ≤ 0.03). Of the LA cultured, 100% contained F. necrophorum, 50% S. enterica, and 0% contained T. pyogenes. The F. necrophorum subsp. Necrophorum was phylogenetically typed and identical to the strain (FN-8LI) infused in the bacterial inoculation. These data suggest that acidotic diet in combination with intraruminal inoculation of the bacterial mixture is sufficient to induce liver abscesses and provides insight on possible mechanisms and origins of LA. Further studies are needed to validate these results and determine if this model may be used to study novel intervention methods.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/101/Supplement_3/68/52957298/skad281.082.pdf",""

In this study, we explored the possibility of developing shortened miR-506-3p analogs that can maintain differentiation-inducing activities comparable to the wild-type miR-506-3p mimic. We found that deleting up to two nucleotides at either the 3′ end or within the middle region of the miR-506-3p sequence fully maintained the differentiation-inducing activity when compared to the wild-type mimic. Deleting up to four nucleotides from the 3′ end or deleting three nucleotides in the middle positions diminished the differentiation-inducing activity, but the analogs still maintained differentiation-inducing activities that were significantly higher than the negative control oligo. The shortened analog designs potentially benefit patients from two perspectives: (1) the reduced cost of manufacturing shortened analogs, and (2) the reduced non-specific toxicity due to their smaller molecular sizes.","https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/28/17/6295/pdf",""

Using a microtiter biofilm assay, the E. coli parent strain showed the highest crystal violet staining. However, when analyzed by culture assays, there was an increase in biofilm populations in the mutants in comparison to the parent strain. Fluorescence microscopy showed differences in colonization patterns in the strains.

Findings/Conclusions: Thirty-eight percent of schools did not address feminine hygiene and menstruation in pretrip communications. Predominant themes consisted of an emphasis on health and hygiene, dependence on female leaders, a need for more knowledge and resources, and a desire for normalization. Implications: Most professionals expressed that resources to expand their knowledge on these topics can help to better prepare participants. Current practices surrounding these topics may be insufficient and able to improve.

By extension, prechambers reduce the overall greenhouse gas production at compressor stations and serve to improve the carbon footprint. A study to provide an initial numerical simulation screening of a new ignition technique in a Cooper-Bessemer GMV two stroke lean burn natural gas engine was conducted using Converge CFD software, guiding original equipment manufacturers and developers in improving combustion processes and reducing methane emissions. Prior to ignition by the primary prechamber, radical and intermediate product of combustion species were introduced into the main combustion chamber by means of a deliberately quenched secondary prechamber to boost mixture reactivity and assist flame propagation through unburned regions. A wide selection of chemical species for the radical and intermediate generating prechamber seeding injection were investigated, as well as three timings of injection and two distinct temperature levels. Across each of the tested conditions, an initial filtering was conducted to establish limits on combinations that produced undesired early ignitions in the main chamber, while non-igniting combinations were investigated for successful seeding potential. In the event of successful seeding, the concentrations of species specifically introduced by the radical and intermediate generating prechamber were compared against the surviving concentrations just before primary ignition, and the impact of the seeding on the combustion process and residual methane concentrations was determined. This study provides an initial numerical screening of a new ignition technique to determine if the approach is promising for reducing methane emissions through ignition system improvements and should be further examined with on-engine experimental evaluation.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/ICEF/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/ICEF2023-110053/7230792/v001t03a004-icef2023-110053.pdf",""

We analyze investments in tax planning by suspect firms and find that most suspect firms increase earnings by curtailing these investments. Thus, suspect firms appear to prefer this direct method to the indirect method that prior studies have examined, in which firms increase investments in tax planning to reduce tax expense and, in turn, increase net income. We next examine the association between investments in tax planning by suspect firms and tax avoidance. Our findings suggest that suspect firms that increase investments in tax planning experience reductions in ETRs during the same period.

However, having the complete and consistent information needed to quickly investigate sources and identify affected material has proven difficult.

The objective of this work is to address the traceability challenge by developing a formal ontology that can provide a shared and common understanding of the traceability model across all stakeholders in a food supply chain. In previous research, an ontological approach was adopted to address the traceability problem in the context of a use case related to harvest to on-farm storage activities. This work extends the Supply Chain Traceability ontology by introducing additional critical tracking events including transform event, sampling event, observation event, custody change event, and ownership change event in the context of a scenario involving shipments of commodity grain from a primary grain elevator to a processor of grain such as a feed manufacturer.

However, much uncertainty around CRM binders still exists regarding the relationship between mixing methods and experiments in order to calculate the separation index. In this study, a laboratory investigation into how CRM binders behave regarding storage stability using different mixing methods and experiments was conducted. The CRM asphalt binder in this study was prepared through a wet mixing process with the addition of 5% and 10% crumb rubber modifier (by weight) at 200 °C. The three main modification methods were method A: high-shear mixing (8000 rpm) for 2 h, method B: low mixing (300 rpm) for 8 h, and method C: high-shear mixing (8000 rpm) for 2 h + low mixing (300 rpm) for 6 h. In addition, the effect of separation index (SI) on storage stability was assessed, measuring viscosity, G*/sin δ, and percentage recovery. In general, the results of this study revealed that method C appeared to have the most prominent effect on decreasing the difference between the values of the top and bottom parts; the results for 5% CRM using method C showed that there were no differences among the values for the top, middle, and bottom parts; from the MSCR test, method C was effective in decreasing the difference between the values of the top and bottom parts. It was observed that method C improved storage stability.

The purpose of this study was to explore PST risk by maternal characteristics and to describe co‐occurring congenital abnormalities in the Texas Birth Defects Registry (TBDR). Methods: We conducted a population‐based descriptive study examining occurrence of PST in the TBDR between 1999 and 2019. The primary outcome variable was PST diagnosis during infancy. Descriptive variables included maternal age, education, and race/ethnicity. Prevalence ratios (PRs) were calculated within each maternal variable category using Poisson regression. Counts and percentages of cases with select co‐occurring congenital abnormalities were also calculated. Results: Overall, 251 infants had PST, providing a prevalence of 0.61/10,000 live male births (95% CI: 0.53–0.68). PST prevalence was significantly lower among infants of mothers who had lower educational attainment (<high school vs. >high school), who were younger (<25 vs. 25–34), and who were Hispanic (vs. non‐Hispanic White) and was significantly higher among older mothers (35+ vs. 25–39). Hypospadias was the most common co‐occurring genitourinary anomaly, affecting close to 70% of cases. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first investigation exploring the prevalence of PST in a population‐based birth defects registry. Our findings help to understand the risk for PST among select maternal demographic characteristics and may assist in generating hypotheses about the underlying etiology of this condition for future work.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/bdr2.2270",""

However, related research can involve significant risks to biosafety and biosecurity. For this purpose, we organized a multidisciplinary biosafety hands-on workshop to inform and increase the knowledge of infectious diseases and risk mitigation. This study aimed to describe the process and outcome of a hands-on biosafety training program using a One Health a pproach across a multidisciplinary and multi-specialty group in Nigeria. Materials and Methods: A face-to-face hands-on training for 48 participants was organized by the West African Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases (WAC-EID) at the Jos University Teaching Hospital, serving as a lead institution for the Nigeria project site. Topics covered included (1) an overview of the WAC-EID research; (2) overview of infection prevention and control; (3) safety in animal handling and restraint, sample collection, and processing; (4) safety in field studies including rodent, bird and bat handling; (5) safety practices in the collection of mosquito and other arthropod vectors; (6) personal protective equipment training (disinfection, donning and doffing); and (7) safety in sample collection, labeling, and transportation. The program was executed using a mixed method of slide presentations, practical hands-on sessions, and video demonstrations. Pre- and post-course evaluation assessments and evaluation measures were used to assess training. Results: A total of 48 trainees participated in this training, with 12 (25%), 16 (33.3%), 14 (29.2%), 6 (12.5%) categorized as ornithology, entomology, mammalogy, and clinical interest groups, respectively. The pass rate for the pre-test was 29.4%, while for the post-test, it was 57.1%, or a 28% improvement. 88.6% of the trainees rated the training as relevant to them. Conclusion: Didactic and hands-on biosafety training is relevant in this era of zoonotic epidemics and pandemic preparedness. During this training program, there was a clear demonstration of knowledge transfer that can change the current practices of participants and improve the safety of infectious diseases research.

Neighborhood contexts in adulthood can serve as risks or resources that may modify the effects of childhood adversity on adult cognitive function, but these effects are not well-understood. We examined whether current positive (i.e., neighborhood cohesion) and negative (i.e., neighborhood violence) neighborhood contexts moderated the effect of childhood stress exposure on cognitive function in adulthood. We used data from 210 adults (Mage = 46.79, SD = 11.02; range: 25–65) residing in a single Zip code in Bronx, New York who completed measures of childhood adversity, current neighborhood contexts, and lab-based cognitive tasks. After adjusting for relevant demographic covariates, childhood adversity was not associated with cognitive function. The interaction between childhood adversity and neighborhood violence was significant, whereby lower childhood adversity was linked with worse performance in perceptual speed for individuals who reported both low (b = 1.19, SE = 0.37), p = .001) and high neighborhood violence (b = 0.75, SE = 0.26, p = .005), with higher scores indicating slower responses and worse performance. Unexpectedly, neighborhood violence was not predictive for those who reported greater childhood adversity. The interaction effect for neighborhood cohesion was not significant. Results indicate that childhood adversity may not have universal effects across all cognitive domains, but rather its effects are complex and may affect cognitive functioning to be adaptive to certain environmental contexts. This study underscores the need to replicate and examine the long-term consequences of these effects on cognitive aging.","https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/7/Supplement_1/538/54739865/igad104.1765.pdf",""

Inorganic complexes provide unique catalyst designs with customizable geometries, which can help enhance their efficiencies. However, they are unstable and susceptible to oxidation under extreme pH conditions. Immobilizing complexes on substrates creates single-molecule catalysts (SMCs) with functional similarities to single-atom catalysts (SACs). Here, an efficient SMC, composed of dichloro(1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane) nickel [NiCl2dppp] anchored to a graphene acid (GA), is presented. This SMC surpasses ruthenium-based OER benchmarks, exhibiting an ultra-low onset and overpotential at 10 mAcm-2 when exposed to a static magnetic field. Comprehensive experimental and theoretical analyses imply that an interfacial charge transfer from the Ni center in NiCl2dppp to GA enhances the OER activity. Spectroscopic investigations reveal an in-situ geometrical transformation of the complex and the formation of a paramagnetic Ni center, which under a magnetic field, enables spin-selective electron transfer, resulting in enhanced OER performance. The results highlight the significance of in-situ geometric transformations in SMCs and underline the potential of an external magnetic field to enhance OER performance at a single-molecule level, pushing the boundaries of volcano limits.","https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/64bb582ab053dad33aad1463/original/nickel-based-single-molecule-catalysts-with-synergistic-geometric-transition-and-magnetic-field-assisted-spin-selection-outperforms-ru-o2-for-oxygen-evolution.pdf",""

The DNA in these samples can be highly degraded and chemically damaged, making downstream genotyping using short tandem repeats (STRs) challenging. Therefore, the use of alternative genetic markers, methods that pre‐amplify the low amount of good quality DNA present, or methods that repair the damaged DNA template may provide more probative genetic information. This study investigated whether whole genome amplification (WGA) and DNA repair could improve STR typing of formaldehyde‐damaged (FD) tissues from embalmed cadavers. Additionally, comparative genotyping success using bi‐allelic markers, including INDELs and SNPs, was explored. Calculated random match probabilities (RMPs) using traditional STRs, INDEL markers, and two next generation sequencing (NGS) panels were compared across all samples. Overall, results showed that neither WGA nor DNA repair substantially improved STR success rates from formalin‐fixed tissue samples. However, when DNA from FD samples was genotyped using INDEL and SNP‐based panels, the RMP of each sample was markedly lower than the RMPs calculated from partial STR profiles. Therefore, the results of this study suggest that rather than attempting to improve the quantity and quality of severely damaged and degraded DNA prior to STR typing, a more productive approach may be to target smaller amplicons to provide more discriminatory DNA identifications. Furthermore, an NGS panel with less loci may yield better results when examining FD samples, due to more optimized chemistries that result in greater allelic balance and amplicon coverage.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1556-4029.15200",""

Additional acceleration was observed due to reactants being transferred to the interface in electro-oxidative C-H/N-H coupling of phenothiazine with N, N’-dimethylaniline, and short-lived intermediates were captured in the radical radical coupling of DMA. Importantly, we applied the combination of electromigration and interfacial microreactor for in-situ extraction of lipids from small-volume plasma samples and accelerated electro-epoxidation of unsaturated lipids to determine the double bond positional isomers in the small-volume serum. The unique feature of electromigration of thin film to the interface and accelerated interfacial reactions holds great potential in small-volume sample analysis for disease diagnosis and prevention.","https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/63d71fa210cb6aa896eb1ad8/original/interfacial-electromigration-for-accelerated-reactions-and-small-volume-analysis.pdf",""

Horses were stratified by BW and age, and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 dietary treatments formulated with canola oil to provide.50 mg CBD/kg BW (TRT1; n = 10), 0.75 mg CBD/kg BW (TRT2; n = 10), or 0.00 mg CBD/kg BW (canola oil; CON; n = 10) only as determined by manufacturer (Arrowhead Labs). Treatments were individually fed and top-dressed onto a commercially available concentrate twice daily at 12 h intervals using attachable feed bags. Diets were formulated to meet or slightly exceed nutritional requirements for mature horses at maintenance. Between meals, horses were maintained in adjacent dry lots and received coastal bermudagrass hay ad libitum. Body weight was obtained, and body condition scores (BCS) were assigned every4 d. On d 0 and 28, blood was collected via jugular venipuncture and serum was harvested to perform a blood chemistry panel and drugs of abuse screening at the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory (TVMDL; College Station, TX). Data were analyzed using PROC MIXED of SAS (v9.4), and the model included treatment, time, and the treatment × time interaction for BW and BCS. Blood chemistry variables on d 0 were used as a covariate and the main effect tested was treatment. Linear and quadratic orthogonal polynomial contrasts were used to partition sum of squares. Analysis of supplement samples revealed supplemented products contained lower CBD concentrations then indicated from initial testing. Therefore, horses in TRT1 and TRT2 received an average of 0.13 mg CBD/kg and 0.12 mg CBD/kg BW, respectively. Dietary treatments did not affect concentrate intake, BW, or BCS. Supplementation of CBD did not result in the presence of any banned substances in serum, including CBD, 7-carboxycannabidiol, 7-Nor-7-carboxycannabidiol, and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Following 28 d of supplementation, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) responded quadratically (P = 0.06) to treatment, with a peak in GGT in horses receiving TRT2. Serum creatinine concentration tended (P = 0.06) to decrease with increasing inclusion of CBD in the diet. In contrast, the main effect of treatment on Ca concentrations was linear (P = 0.01) and characterized by decreased Ca values for TRT1 compared with TRT2 and CON. Canola based CBD oil was well-accepted by mature horses, banned substances were not detectible in blood, and blood chemistry parameters were not adversely affected as a result of supplementation; however, more information is needed to improve stability of CBD used in dietary products.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/101/Supplement_1/62/50196313/skad068.074.pdf",""

Ageism in employment and the workplace have detrimental effects on older job seekers, organizations, and society. Therefore, this conceptual paper explores the financial, emotional, psychological, and physical factors that should be considered when supporting older job seekers in navigating reeducation and learning to obtain employment. We collected and reviewed extant literature on this topic by consulting the following databases: EBSCOhost, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and PubMed and using search terms such as “older adult,” “workplace,” “ageism,” “employment.” Ageist practices and stereotypes can occur at any stage of the employment process, including application, interview, hiring, training, job duties, benefits, downsizing, or termination. Older job seekers or employees may experience age discrimination in the workplace directly (e.g., if employers consider candidates cannot project the youthful image that the business desires, they may decline to offer the position) or indirectly (employers reject older applicants for a job because of their overqualification). We provide practical implications for older job seekers by exploring workplace learning strategies for older adults, including peer mentoring, intergenerational learning (Arthanat, 2019), proactive personality, and effective job search activity (Zacher, 2013). In addition, we discuss how older workers need to see the relevance of tasks to be individually motivated to learn and explore the need for personalized learning programs (Seo et al., 2019).","https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/7/Supplement_1/716/54745019/igad104.2321.pdf",""

The study found that adding processed oil to CRM-modified binders reduces viscosity and improves workability, while CRM improves the rutting resistance. However, the addition of processed oil reduces the binder’s rutting performance. The study also found that CRM and processed oil improve the low temperature cracking resistance. The study’s results indicate that co-modifying CRM binders with processed oil resulted in a significant reduction in viscosity values, resulting in improved workability.

Limited information is available about survival of infants born with hydrocephaly in Texas. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to calculate survival estimates among infants born with hydrocephaly without spina bifida in Texas. Methods: A cohort of live‐born infants delivered during 1999–2017 with congenital hydrocephaly without spina bifida was identified from the Texas Birth Defects Registry. Deaths within 1 year of delivery were identified using vital and medical records. One‐year infant survival estimates were generated for multiple descriptive characteristics using the Kaplan–Meier method. Crude hazard ratios (HRs) for one‐year survival among infants with congenital hydrocephaly by maternal and infant characteristics and adjusted HRs for maternal race and ethnicity were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models. Results: Among 5709 infants born with congenital hydrocephaly without spina bifida, 4681 (82%) survived the first year. The following characteristics were associated with infant survival: maternal race and ethnicity, clinical classification (e.g., chromosomal or syndromic), preterm birth, birth weight, birth year, and maternal education. In the multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, differences in survival were observed by maternal race and ethnicity after adjustment for other maternal and infant characteristics. Infants of non‐Hispanic Black (HR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.04–1.58) and Hispanic (HR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.12–1.54) women had increased risk for mortality, compared with infants of non‐Hispanic White women. Conclusions: This study showed infant survival among a Texas cohort differed by maternal race and ethnicity, clinical classification, gestational age, birth weight, birth year, and maternal education in infants with congenital hydrocephaly without spina bifida. Findings confirm that mortality continues to be common among infants with hydrocephaly without spina bifida.

Nurses are one population particularly susceptible to both sleep/circadian disruption and PTSD, given they frequently engage in shift work and experience high occupational stress. However, the specific types of sleep and circadian disruptions in PTSD have not been identified in nurses using validated measures of sleep, limiting potential intervention efforts. Methods: To address this gap, we developed a machine learning algorithm for calculating risk of PTSD in nurses based on sleep, light, and physical activity patterns derived from actigraphy, in conjunction with inflammatory biomarkers. Participants were 392 nurses (mean age = 39.54, 92% female, 78% White) recruited from two Dallas-area hospitals for a larger longitudinal study on sleep and vaccine response. At baseline, nurses reported on demographics and PTSD symptoms using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Nurses were categorized as having probable PTSD if they reported scores &gt;31 on the PCL-5. Nurses wore actigraphy devices for two weeks to track sleep/wake, activity counts, and light exposure. In the middle of the two-week period, nurses also had a blood draw to determine inflammatory markers interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), IL-1 beta (IL-1β), and interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10). Results: 4.7% of nurses met criteria for probable PTSD. Using the actigraphy and inflammatory biomarker data, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) was developed to detect PTSD risk. Furthermore the Ridge Classifier was tested using activity counts, light exposure, and sleep/wake data to obtain an accuracy score of 0.97 and an F1 score (ranging between 0 and 1) of 0.96, indicating that the model was able to balance and maximize precision and determine PTSD risk successfully. Conclusion: Using a novel machine learning algorithm, we show that actigraphy data can be used to accurately and non-invasively detect PTSD risk among nurses. Although additional validation is needed, results tentatively highlight the utility of harnessing real-time data to inform just-in-time adaptive interventions for PTSD among nurses. Given the essential role nurses play in the healthcare system, finding ways to support their well-being is of critical public health importance.

PG 64-22 was blended with SIS and Processed Oil at three levels (5%, 10%, and 15% by weight of binder) and two concentrations (6% and 12% by weight of binder), respectively. Modified binders underwent two short and long artificial aging processes, through the spinning of the thin film in an RTFO oven and a pressure aging vessel (PAV). The Superpave binder evaluations were carried out using a rotational viscometer (RV), dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), and bending beam rheometer (BBR). According to the findings of the research, the addition of SIS caused higher values of viscosity, but when co-modified with processed oil, there was a substantial decrease in viscosity values. As a result, workability was improved. (1) It was observed that a greater reduction in viscosity was achieved when the processed oil was present at a higher concentration at 135 °C compared to a lower concentration. (2) The study showed that the incorporation of processed oil led to a reduction in rutting performance of the asphalt binder. However, the addition of SIS resulted in a notable enhancement of rutting resistance. (3) The role of processed oil as co-modifier at concentrations of 6% and 12% caused significant decreases in G*sin δ, based on the susceptibility of asphalt molecules to accept oil molecules in their network links. (4) The extracted measurements from the BBR tests indicated that modification with SIS and PO improved the low-temperature cracking resistance significantly.

Bromodomain‐containing protein 4 (BRD4) is one of the essential cellular factors involved in multiple stages of viral transcription and replication. In this review, we demonstrate the role of BRD4 in the multiple stages of HPV infectious cycle.

Profound stress system dysfunction is a hallmark characteristic of major depressive disorder (MDD), likely contributing to MDD-CVD comorbidity. Although a greater increase in negative affective responsivity (NA-R) to daily stress is evident in adults with MDD, whether this is linked to heightened cardiovascular stress reactivity remains unclear. We hypothesized that the slope of the positive relation between daily stress (quantified as both exposure frequency and NA-R) and the magnitude of acute stress-induced increases in heart rate (HR) and blood pressure would be steeper in adults with MDD compared to healthy non-depressed adults (HA). For 8 consecutive days, stressful events encountered in everyday life and while in naturalistic environments (e.g., argument with a partner) were assessed via an ambulatory daily diary in 40 HA (22±4 yrs; 24 female) and 40 adults with MDD (23±6 yrs; 32 female). On the last day of the daily dairy, HR (electrocardiogram) and mean arterial pressure (MAP; finger photoplethysmography) were measured during the cold pressor test (CPT). Daily stress exposure frequency was calculated as the percentage of days with at least one stressor reported across the 8-day protocol, and NA-R was calculated as the intra-individual slope of the change in negative affect on stressor days (at least 1 stressor) compared to negative affect on stressor-free days (no stressors). There were no group differences in the frequency of daily stressor exposure [36±26 (range: 0-100) HA v 41±23% (range: 0-100) MDD; p=0.32]; however, as expected, NA-R was greater in adults with MDD [0.23±0.10 (range: 0.09-0.52) HA vs 0.34±0.16 a.u. (range:0.09-0.71) MDD; p<0.01]. Daily stressor exposure frequency was not related to CPT-induced increases in HR or MAP in either group (all p>0.05). However, NA-R was positively related to both the CPT-induced increase in HR (β=35.18, SE=9.04, p<0.01) and MAP (β=20.20, SE=9.16, p=0.03) in adults with MDD but not in HA (HR: β=2.89, SE=21.23, p=0.89; MAP: β=1.70, SE=17.78, p=0.92). These data suggest that increased emotional vulnerability to common stressors that occur in naturalistic environments and as a part of day-to-day living is linked to potentiated cardiovascular stress reactivity in young adults with MDD, likely contributing to increased CVD risk.","",""

Although breast cancer screening and treatments have improved significantly over the last half-century, aggressive subtypes like triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) as well as growing chemoresistance cases continue to evade frontline therapies. STAT3, a transcription factor involved in cell proliferation, survival, and malignant transformation, plays a key role in mammary carcinogenesis, resistance, and recurrence. Both STAT3 overexpression and aberrant activation are frequently observed in primary breast tumors and their metastatic lesions. Although STAT3 is recognized as an attractive preventive and therapeutic target, there are no FDA-approved STAT3 inhibitors in clinical use. Via structure- and fragment-based drug design strategies as well as in silico molecular modeling and docking, our team previously developed a putative STAT3 inhibitor, HJC0152. This study aims to further characterize the anticancer mechanism of HJC0152 as well as optimize its potency. Our results show that HJC0152 interacts with STAT3 with a similar specificity to an experimental STAT3 inhibitor, Stattic. To further improve its potency and efficacy, we developed several HJC0152 derivatives including HJC0152-based proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) degraders. Several molecules showed comparable or improved potency to HJC0152 against several breast cancer cell lines including TNBC cells. While the total STAT3 protein level reduces moderately with HJC0152 treatment, several new compounds decrease STAT3 protein level more profoundly. In particular, the newly developed HJC0152-PROTACs showed a significant late inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation at the Tyr705 and Ser727 residues as well as a reduction in total STAT3 protein. Our data indicate that HJC0152-based analogs and protein degraders can suppress breast cancer cell proliferation, likely through targeting STAT3 signaling pathway. Future experiments will determine the molecular prolife of promising molecules as well as assess their in vivo anticancer efficacy using xenograft models.

During the Classic period, royal individuals were often buried in crypts or tombs marked with water symbolism that symbolically placed the individual within the watery underworld. Layers of lithics overlying these important interments were part of this symbolism. Water symbolism of this nature has deep roots in Maya ideology, beginning as early as the Middle Preclassic, prior to institutionalized political authority. In this article, we explore the relationships between large lithic deposits and underworld and water symbolism at Las Ruinas de Arenal and Buenavista del Cayo to shed light on diachronic transformations of ritual practices involving lithics and other objects reflecting the watery underworld. The deposits at Arenal suggest that during the Preclassic period, watery underworld symbolism was part of communal ritual activities that occurred in public ritual locations. At Buenavista, large lithic deposits reflecting underworld symbolism are more restricted and individualized in nature. We believe this reflects elite incorporation of communal practices to legitimize their privileged position in society and reinforce their political authority.","",""

U.S. and European surface water, soil, and sediment measurements confirmed bis-FASI release internationally at concentrations as high as 2,437 parts per trillion (ppt). Toxicity data demonstrated effects on swimming behavior in Daphnia magna at bis-FASI exposures of 10 ppt and swimming behavior and metabolic process changes in Danio rerio resulting from exposures of 25 ppt. Occurrence of up to 881 ppt of bis-FASIs in landfill leachates highlights current impacts of LiB disposal. Although fully recalcitrant to advanced oxidation processes, select bis-FASIs were removed from water during adsorptive treatment with similar or better efficiency as more hydrophobic PFAS such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). LiB use is anticipated to increase globally over the next decade, and 8 million tons of LiB waste are projected by 2040 as a result of low recycling rates<sup>16</sup>.

A computer program to optimize weaning weight, profitability, and environmental sustainability of grazing cow-calf operations was developed by combining an existing mechanistic nutrition model with pasture biomass estimated using satellite images. Data from the Texas A&M University McGregor Research Center was used as a testbed for the computer model. Pasture forage data from 2016 to 2022 was collected via satellite imagery, and the predicted pasture biomass was adjusted based on third-party algorithms (Sigfarm Intelligence LLC). Nutrient requirements were estimated using the Ruminant Nutrition System (RNS), and a constant pasture nutritive value was obtained. The potential dry matter intake (DMI) was estimated from the initial herd size (input). Actual average weaning weight was used to predict cow milk yield and total metabolizable energy requirements, which was used to estimate the required DMI (DMR). The actual forage allowance was correlated to DMR, and we simulated the forage allowance to support increased DMI and, consequently, increased milk yield to achieve a targeted average weaning weight. Based on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodology, environmental impact was evaluated from greenhouse gas emission estimates. Our simulations demonstrated that increasing the target weaning weight of a smaller herd with fewer mature cows (757 cows) would produce heavier calves, resulting in a 6% decrease in calf gain per pasture area. Nevertheless, the net income increased in scenarios with heavier weaned calves. The enhanced productivity with heavier weaned calves and fewer cows resulted in a lower carbon emission per kg of produced weaned calves. Based on our simulation, a herd size between 757 and 812 mature cows yielding calves weaned between 280 and 300 kg would be an optimal management strategy for the studied operation. This computer model provides the fundamental framework for a decision-support tool for producers to optimize their cow-calf operations while producing ideal weaned calves for feedlot operations.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/101/Supplement_3/481/52958005/skad281.571.pdf",""

Prevalence and abundance values for samples were generally different between SYBRGreen- and Taqman-based detection methods, with higher specificity observed for Taqman-based detection. Of the 314 samples analyzed, initial screening with SYBRGreen-based qPCR retrieved 138 positive samples, of which 52 were confirmed by Taqman-based analyses as chlamydiae. All of these samples were subsequently identified as Chlamydia pneumoniae by specific qPCR and confirmed by comparative sequence analyses of 23S rRNA gene amplicons.

The thermosyphon was constructed from Inconel alloy 625. The outer diameter of the thermosyphon measures 27 mm, with a thickness of 2.6 mm, and an overall length of 483 mm, which includes a 180-mm evaporator, a 70-mm adiabatic section, a 223-mm condenser, and a 97-mm finned exchanger. The study involved directing exhaust gas onto the evaporator end cap at a flow rate ranging from 0–10 g/sec, with temperatures varying from 300–900°C. The impact of three parameters, namely the inclination angle (ranging from 5°–45°), water mass (ranging from 2 g–5.3 g), and the amount of non-condensable gas Argon (ranging from 0 g–0.6 g), were analyzed to determine their effects on the thermal performance of the thermosyphon. Based on the experimental results, it was observed that when the thermosyphon contained 3 g of water and 0.0564g of argon, the condenser achieved a maximum temperature of approximately 200°C. The optimal fuel loading rate for the thermosyphon lies within the range of 0.2 g/s to 0.7 g/s. Furthermore, outer wall temperatures of the thermosyphon increase as inclination angles increase due to the explicit expansion of the actual heating area within the evaporation section of the thermosyphon, accompanied by an augmented gravitational component of the water flux. An increase in the quantity of non-condensable gas (NCG) can diminish temperature gradients on the outer wall of the thermosyphon, leading to a reduction in the thermosyphon’s performance. The insulation applied at the adiabatic section proved effective in increasing temperature gradients on the outer wall of the thermosyphon and thereby enhancing the performance of the thermosyphon. With an increase in the water charge within the thermosyphon, heat transfer rates from the exhaust to the thermosyphon and from the thermosyphon to the fuel increase.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2023-109452/7240245/v010t11a018-imece2023-109452.pdf",""

We utilize reward machines to incorporate high-level knowledge of complex tasks. We develop an algorithm called Q-learning with reward machines for stochastic games (QRM-SG), to learn the best-response strategy at Nash equilibrium for each agent. In QRM-SG, we define the Q-function at a Nash equilibrium in augmented state space. The augmented state space integrates the state of the stochastic game and the state of reward machines. Each agent learns the Q-functions of all agents in the system. We prove that Q-functions learned in QRM-SG converge to the Q-functions at a Nash equilibrium if the stage game at each time step during learning has a global optimum point or a saddle point, and the agents update Q-functions based on the best-response strategy at this point. We use the Lemke-Howson method to derive the best-response strategy given current Q-functions. The three case studies show that QRM-SG can learn the best-response strategies effectively. QRM-SG learns the best-response strategies after around 7500 episodes in Case Study I, 1000 episodes in Case Study II, and 1500 episodes in Case Study III, while baseline methods such as Nash Q-learning and MADDPG fail to converge to the Nash equilibrium in all three case studies.","https://ebooks.iospress.nl/pdf/doi/10.3233/FAIA230380",""

However, the heat loss due to reflected and emitted radiation hinders the maximum achievable thermal efficiency for solar receiver tubes on the solar tower. Current solar selective coatings cannot withstand the high temperatures that come with state-of-the-art CSP towers often needing to be recoated soon after initial operation. We intend to use Inconel 718 with different additive manufacturing (AM) practices to construct surfaces that allow for more light-trapping to occur. By adjusting printing parameters, we can tailor a surface to allow for more absorption while diminishing emitted radiation heat loss. By using COMSOL Multiphysics, we can generate these theoretical surfaces to emulate a printed surface, and using the coupled Multiphysics we can simulate how the surface dictates radiation properties. Our results show that by having a rougher surface we can enhance the absorptivity of Inconel 718 (IN718) by 38.8%.

Oridonin is a natural diterpene compound enriched in medicinal herb Rabdosia rubescens, and its unique anti-cancer properties have been extensively studied. However, clinical applications of oridonin are limited due to its relatively low potency. Previously, we developed a class of druglike nitrogen-enriched oridonin derivatives, including CYD0618 and others, with thiazole modifications as effective anticancer agents to inhibit breast cancer growth in vitro and in vivo. Although breast cancer screening and treatments have improved over the last half-century, aggressive subtypes like triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) are refractory to frontline therapies, in which the STAT3 transcription factor plays a key role in developing therapeutic resistance and recurrence. Currently, there are no FDA-approved direct STAT3 inhibitors in clinical use. We reported that CYD0618 inhibits STAT3 signaling, likely through a direct interaction with STAT3. With proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology, our team designed novel oridonin- and CYD0618-based PROTAC compounds including PW0965 and PW1087 in an attempt to achieve STAT3 binding and degradation. We determined anticancer effects of PW0965 and PW1087 on proliferation, colony formation, apoptosis and cell motility of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells MDA-MB-231 and BT549. We found that both compounds significantly inhibited the proliferation of TNBC cells. Compared with oridonin, both compounds more effectively induced apoptosis of TNBC cells. Additionally, MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells treated with these PROTACs showed significantly reduced migration and invasion compared to control cells. PW0965 and PW1087 treatment reduced protein levels of STAT3 and its activation at Y705 residue in TNBC cells as early as 4 hours of treatment. This observed reduction in STAT3 protein on Western blot exhibited dose and time dependence. Collectively, our results demonstrate that oridonin and its analog-based PROTACs exhibit excellent potency against TNBC cells, likely through protein degradation of STAT3. The potency of PW0965 and PW1087 warrants further in vitro and in vivo investigation in cancer cells and tumor xenograft models. The molecular profiles of these PROTACs, including their interactions with STAT proteins and protein degradation, are currently under investigation.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/83/7_Supplement/1651/722813/Abstract-1651-Discovery-of-oridonin-based",""

Utilizing a well-validated scale, we measure LMX with 167 practicing auditors. We find LMX with a single supervisor significantly impacts retention via organizational commitment. This finding is novel in the LMX literature given the unique audit setting where subordinates have multiple supervisors and transitory teams. In an exploratory analysis, we also find female subordinates form lower-quality relationships with supervisors, regardless of supervisor sex, which in turn can influence the impact of LMX on organizational commitment. Results demonstrate the value of measuring LMX in audit research and practically highlight the importance of fostering positive, strong auditor-supervisor relationships.","https://publications.aaahq.org/bria/article-pdf/35/2/1/98821/i1050-4753-35-2-1.pdf",""

However, major challenges remain that hinder the practical implications for volunteer activity as a public health intervention, including potential selection effects, lack of longitudinal studies that adjust for baseline characteristics, and a paucity of studies that consider multiple physical health outcomes in a single model. Using data from the 2006-2016 waves of the Health and Retirement Study (N=18,847) and an outcome-wide approach, the current paper evaluated if changes in volunteering between 2006/2008 (t0) and 2010/2012 (t1) were associated with seven cardiovascular disease biomarkers four years later (2014/2016, t2). Further, these models were adjusted for demographic factors, socioeconomic status, health behaviors, chronic conditions, baseline biomarkers, and baseline volunteering. Inverse probability treatment weights (IPTW) were included for the selection into volunteering and multiple imputation was conducted for missing data. Compared to non-volunteers, volunteering more than 200 hours a year was associated with a lower risk for clinically high diastolic blood pressure. Increased volunteering effort (change from 1-99 hours at t0 to &gt;100 hours at t1) was associated with a lower likelihood of clinically high systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels. Sustained high volunteering (&gt;100 hours at both t0 and t1) was associated with lower diastolic blood pressure. The current study adds to the evidence of the health benefits of volunteering for adults 50 and older by inferring a potential causal link between high-intensity volunteering and reduced blood pressure.","https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/7/Supplement_1/490/54739272/igad104.1611.pdf",""

Our study examined the relationship between Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and the specific antisocial behavior of malevolent creativity (MC), the application of original ideas to purposely harm others, often to gain an unfair advantage through manipulation, threat, or harm. Methods: We surveyed college students (N = 524; 78% women) on demographics, ACEs, empathy, social support, coping, general creativity, and malevolent creativity. The data were analyzed via sequential linear regression models. Results: Reporting ≥ 4 ACEs was associated with increased MC, which remained significant when general creativity and demographics were controlled. The association between higher ACEs and MC was no longer significant when psychosocial control variables (social support, empathy, and coping) were included in the statistical model. Social support and empathy were negatively associated with MC, while coping and MC were positively associated. Conclusions: ACEs may increase the likelihood of malevolent creativity in young adulthood, but empathy and social support may disrupt this trajectory. Care should be taken that coping skills, while typically viewed as a positive addition to one’s behavioral repertoire, do not push individuals toward over-reliance on themselves, which may reduce prosocial behaviors and increase MC.","https://www.mdpi.com/2076-328X/13/12/961/pdf",""

Studying archaeobotanical records is vital to a holistic interpretation of material culture and contributes to understanding degrees of variation between ecological and cultural areas. Together with archaeobotany, ethnobotanical survey can also offer valuable contextual evidence when studying past environments. Despite spatial and temporal discontinuities in plant-use and knowledge systems, ethnobotanical data viewed with a critical lens can also provide data missing from the archaeological record which is inherently not exhaustive and relies heavily on interpretation. Ethnobotanical and paleoethnobotanical research at the Programme for Belize Archaeological Project (PfBAP) includes ethnobotanical interviews conducted in the nearby town of San Felipe and archaeobotanical investigations at Structure 3 at the site of La Milpa. By combining a modern analogue of plant practices and knowledge systems via ethnobotanical survey, collecting plant specimens for an archaeobotanical reference library, collecting soil samples from new projects, and sampling artifacts for residues, archaeobotanical research at PfBAP continues to expand what we know about the ancient Maya in northwestern Belize.","",""

However, the advent of cognitive function support information technologies may improve their community engagement, perhaps more than memory training alone. This study examined information communication technology usage as a mediator of associations of cognitive decline and community engagement in older adults. Methods: We sampled older adult cases from Round 11 of the National Health and Aging Trends Study data set (N=3817) with cognitive decline in community dwelling (mean age =81.38, SD=6.266), male (n= 1313) and female (n=1771). We utilized multi-level Structural Equation Model (SEM) to examine the mediation of cognitive decline and community connection through the ICTs, as well as direct relationships among memory, orientation, and executive function. Results: From SEM analysis, an increase of ICTs usage has statistically significantly effects on older adults’ cognitive ability overall (Estimate = 0.103, S.E. = 0.023, C.R. = 4.438, p &lt; 0.001). Cognitive function has a direct impact on the activity orientation function (Estimate=1, p &lt; 0.0011.000). The greater usage of ICTs by older adults is associated with higher levels of community engagement (Estimate = 1.230, S.E. = 0.284, C.R. = 4.338, P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: This finding highlights the potential role of ICTs in fostering older adults’ cognitive function for their social interactions and community involvement. Digital age older adults may have greater cognitive function than previous cohort, reducing demand for care services their community participation.","https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/7/Supplement_1/1007/54746685/igad104.3236.pdf",""

Conditions used for instrumental analysis should maximize decarboxylation, while minimizing the in situ production of Δ9‐THC inside the GC inlet. In this study, decarboxylation of the acidic Δ9‐THC precursor and in situ degradation of cannabidiol (CBD) were investigated using seven commercial GC liners with different deactivation chemistries and geometries. While the inlet temperature was previously optimized at 250°C in a previously validated assay, we systematically examined the temperature‐dependent decarboxylation of tetrahydrocannabinolic acid‐A (Δ9‐THCA‐A) and cyclization of CBD between 230°C and 310°C using different liners using favorable and unfavorable conditions. Significant differences in decarboxylation rate and CBD cyclization were observed between different liner types. While no temperature‐dependent differences in decarboxylation rate were observed within liner type, liner‐dependent differences were observed (α = 0.05), particularly between those with different geometry. In contrast, temperature and liner‐dependent differences were observed for in situ formation of Δ9‐THC (α = 0.05). This was influenced by liner geometry and to a smaller extent by surface deactivation. Effects were exacerbated with liner usage. While significant differences were observed using new and used GC liners, differences between liners of the same type but different lot numbers were not observed. Inter‐instrument differences using the same liner were also evaluated and had minimal effect. Liner‐ and temperature‐dependent effects were also confirmed using more than 20 cannabis plant extracts. Careful selection of liner, inlet conditions, and regular preventive maintenance can mitigate the risks associated with in situ formation Δ9‐THC from CBD.","",""

For two competing population models, the Bayes factor reflects the relative likelihood of observing some data under one model compared to the other. Computing Bayes factors can be difficult, requiring one to integrate the product of the likelihood and a prior distribution on the population parameter(s) for both competing models. Previous work has obviated this difficulty for independent-groups designs. In this paper, we develop a new analytic formula for computing Bayes factors directly from minimal summary statistics in repeated-measures designs. This work is an improvement on previous methods for computing Bayes factors from summary statistics (e.g., the BIC method), which produce Bayes factors that violate the Sellke upper bound of evidence for smaller sample sizes.

Past research on presidential elections supports the idea that borderlands counties vote differently than other counties in borderlands states and tend to favor Democratic Party candidates. This study explores congressional voting patterns in the Texas borderlands. Methods: Using county‐level data for Texas counties in 2010 and 2022, this study examines Republican congressional voting as a function of (1) borderlands cultural and economic context, (2) economic conditions, (3) social contact, and (4) religious adherence. We contribute to existing scholarship by proposing that there are three district border subregions. Results: Overall, this study finds increased levels of support for Republican congressional candidates in the borderlands region. However, when subregions are compared, those counties with economic linkages to Mexico and rural Tejano counties are more likely to vote for Democratic Party candidates in 2010 and 2022. The West Texas borderlands region, however, is no longer distinctive from other Texas counties in terms of voting patterns in 2022. Conclusion: Voters in the predominantly Latino Texas borderlands are increasingly voting for Republican congressional candidates suggesting a change in partisan attachment. The effects of foreign‐born arrivals and rising economic optimism in the borderlands may lead to more voting for Republican candidates. However, current economic realities and linkages as well as past social and political marginalization may continue to make borderlands voters distinct.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ssqu.13321",""

We modeled nine flows across a range of flood frequency recurrence intervals from 257 m3s−1 to ~4997 m3s−1 and estimated the availability of suitable spawning water depths (0.2 to 2 m) and lateral connectedness between the river and suitable floodplain landcover types. We estimated the ages via otoliths of 95 Alligator Gar collected in the reach to determine the year that they were recruited into the system. We analyzed a total of 30 Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration flow metrics to examine how the spatially derived suitable habitats related to the temporal aspects of flow occurrence during the spawning season for the period of flow record April–July (1935–2020) and to the years spanning the recruitment data of the Alligator Gar (1981–2010). A non-linear relationship existed between suitable spawning habitat area and the flow regime, with the most habitat availability corresponding to the 10–20-year flood recurrence interval frequency with peak flows of 2057–3108 m3s−1, respectively. The Alligator Gar recruitment data indicated that six years provided high recruitment, which correlated with peak flows of ~5-year frequency with an available spawning area of ~9000 Ha, moderate recruitment years related to peak flows with ~3-year frequency with an available spawning area of 6000 Ha, and low recruitment years where spawning was likely to occur at least every other year with at least 2500 Ha of available spawning area. The results of this model support the development of legislatively mandated environmental flow standards for the Guadalupe River Basin, inform field-based efforts for collecting empirical and observational data on the species’ reproduction, and provide spatial and temporal information for designing conservation strategies for Alligator Gar.","https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5338/10/6/123/pdf",""

A potential strategy to combat this problem is investigating alternative routes of administration, requiring quantitation of the drug in the brain tissues by liquid chromatography‐mass spectrometry. However, current methods used to extract the drug from brain tissues resulted in poor recovery and substantial matrix effects. Herein, we reported a new two‐step extraction method that involves the use of Proteinase K to lyse tumor tissues to efficiently release the drug, followed by ethanol protein precipitation. The extracts were then separated on a C18 column and analyzed in positive electrospray ionization, a multiple reaction monitoring mode of the triple quadrupole. We found this new method led to a recovery of 82% with negligible matrix effects. The method has been validated in accordance with Food and Drug Administration guidance for linearity, specificity, selectivity, accuracy, precision, carry‐over, stability, and lower limit of quantitation. In conclusion, we have developed and validated a liquid chromatography‐mass spectrometry method with a novel sample preparation method that was able to efficiently extract temozolomide from mouse brain tissue with high recovery.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/sscp.202200133",""

In addition, the formation of biofilm by PA makes effective treatment difficult. Peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PPMOs) are novel antisense antimicrobials that are designed to target pathogens in a gene-specific way and prevent translation of protein. We have demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity of lead PPMOs in PA; however, it remains unclear whether PPMOs remain active in the biofilm setting over time and if synergy can be achieved with traditional antibiotics. Methods: P. aeruginosa (GFP-PAO1) was dosed with a rhodamine-labelled PPMO targeting acpP. Samples were fixed at different time intervals and imaged by fluorescent microscopy. A Pearson’s coefficient was recorded for each dose and time condition. Minimum biofilm eradication concentration plates were used to treat PA biofilm with acpP or rpsJ targeted PPMOs in daily dosing experiments. Fixed synergy assays were performed on mature biofilm via 24-hour Q8 dosing with PPMO, antibiotics or control. Biofilm burden was quantified by CFU enumeration. Results: PPMOs co-localized with PA in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Pearson coefficients increased from 0.0583 at the 30-minutes to 0.4118 and 0.4976 at the 3- and 5-hour time points respectively. In addition, biofilm reduction was dose-dependent. In daily dosing experiments, the 3’RXR4-AcpP PPMO resulted in a 5-log reduction in biofilm burden compared to control on day 7 [p&lt; 0.0001]; the 5’RXR4-RpsJ PPMO resulted in a 5.5-log reduction in biofilm burden compared to no treatment control [p&lt; 0.0001]. PPMOs incubated with tobramycin or aztreonam were found to have synergistic (FIC&lt; 0.5) or antagonistic effects (FIC &gt; 1) in biofilm and planktonic killing depending on the combination tested. Conclusion: Lead PA PPMOs demonstrate dose and time-dependent biofilm eradication over multiple days of therapy. In addition, some PPMOs demonstrate synergy with other small molecule antibiotics that are used to treat certain patients with PA infections. PA PPMOs could be an innovative treatment modality for infection due to Pseudomonas. Disclosures: David E.

The present paper is derived from the qualitative research informing “Music in the Course of Life” (Routledge, 2023). Following the symbolic interactionist/existentialist paradigm, we reconfigured the life course model of organizing aging by seeing life course as a concept of the self that can be observed in various situations, that are not necessarily linearly ordered, in everyday life. We observed music as it is presented and performed in residential facilities, at home, in hospitals and in hospice. The self experience can be portrayed as “Being,” “Becoming,” and “Been There” in the case of many seniors. The primary value of music for dementia care is not predicated on eliciting music from memory or from regenerating cognition. The pleasures of music are exceptionally situational so that the elderly person need not have any prior exposure to or experience with music that now is positive affectively, cognitively and/or socially. The meaningful music situation--especially at end of life--is composed of significant others providing the music, attendees singing or humming along with the music, a caretaker to orchestrate the situation.","https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/7/Supplement_1/424/54740589/igad104.1400.pdf",""

These challenges include extreme temperatures, smoke, toxic gases, explosions, and falling objects, which can hinder their efficiency and pose risks to their safety. Accurate information and data about the burning site can help firefighters make informed decisions about their duties and determine when it is safe to enter and evacuate, reducing the likelihood of casualties. This research presents unsupervised deep learning (DL) to classify the danger levels at a burning site and an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) prediction model to forecast temperature changes using the extrapolation of a random forest regressor. The DL classifier algorithms provide the chief firefighter with an awareness of the danger levels in the burning compartment. The prediction models forecast the rise in temperature from a height ranging from 0.6 m to 2.6 m and the changes in temperature over time at an altitude of 2.6 m. Predicting the temperature at this altitude is critical as the temperature increases faster with height, and elevated temperatures can weaken the building’s structural material. We also investigated a new classification method using an unsupervised DL autoencoder artificial neural network (AE-ANN). The prediction data analytical approach included using the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) with random forest regression implementation. The proposed AE-ANN model, with an accuracy score of 0.869, did not perform as well compared to previous work, with an accuracy of 0.989, at achieving high accuracy scores for the classification task using the same dataset. However, the random forest regressor and our ARIMA models are analyzed and evaluated in this work, while other research has not utilized this dataset, even though it is open-sourced. However, the ARIMA model demonstrated remarkable predictions of the trends of temperature changes in a burning site. The proposed research aims to classify fire sites into dangerous levels and predict temperature progression using deep learning and predictive modeling techniques. This research’s main contribution is using a random forest regressor and autoregressive integrated moving average models to predict temperature trends in burning sites. This research demonstrates the potential of using deep learning and predictive modeling to enhance firefighter safety and decision-making processes.","https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/10/4628/pdf",""

To overcome these challenges, this study explores a mesh-free method based on deep learning to accelerate solute transport simulation. We employ Physics-informed Neural Networks (PiNN) with a periodic activation function to solve solute transport problems in both homogeneous and heterogeneous porous media governed by the advection-dispersion equation. Unlike traditional neural networks that rely on large training datasets, PiNNs use strong-form mathematical models to constrain the network in the training phase and simultaneously solve for multiple dependent or independent field variables, such as pressure and solute concentration fields. To demonstrate the effectiveness of using PiNNs with a periodic activation function to resolve solute transport in porous media, we construct PiNNs using two activation functions, sin and tanh, for seven case studies, including 1D and 2D scenarios. The accuracy of the PiNNs’ predictions is then evaluated using absolute point error and mean square error metrics and compared to the ground truth solutions obtained analytically or numerically. Our results demonstrate that the PiNN with sin activation function, compared to tanh activation function, is up to two orders of magnitude more accurate and up to two times faster to train, especially in heterogeneous porous media. Moreover, PiNN’s simultaneous predictions of pressure and concentration fields can reduce computational expenses in terms of inference time by three orders of magnitude compared to FEM simulations for two-dimensional cases.","https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/12/1/63/pdf",""

It is time to increase the level of science behind our approach. The research team represented in this talk is investigating a new methodology that combines the alkali availability needed to initiate ASR (aggregate specific) with the available alkali from the total cementitious blend. The relationship between reactivity of a supplementary cementitious material and the ASR expansion is also explored.

The financial sustainability of nursing homes has been threatened in the recent past by high staff turnover, growing competition, low Medicaid reimbursement, and declining occupancy rates. The literature suggests that nurse staffing may have a significant impact on NH financial performance. We examined whether higher ratios of contract nurse use were associated with NHs operating margin. Employing a pooled cross-sectional observational study design, we extracted secondary data from the PBJ nurse staffing, Nursing Home Compare, Healthcare Cost Report Information System (HCRIS) Dataset, RUCA codes, and the ACS for the period 2017-2021. To test the relationship between the ratios of contract nurses and operating margin, we employed multivariate mixed-effects maximum likelihood regression. We ran three separate regressions for RN, LPN, and CNA. Our findings showed that a 10% increase in the contract nurse ratio among RNs, LPNs, and CNAs is associated with a 0.45%, 0.48%, and 0.52% decrease in operating margin, respectively. Our results demonstrate a consistent negative association between the ratio of contract nurses and nursing home operating margin. Our results are consistent with the extant literature with contract nurse staffing said to be significantly more expensive. Considering NHs operate in a financially precarious environment, the increased utilization of contract nurse staffing may pose a further threat to their financial viability, with negative implications for quality and access.","https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/7/Supplement_1/226/54739027/igad104.0747.pdf",""

Transportation assets, such as pavements and bridges, are inevitably subject to the effects of climate and environment. These stressors mainly include flood, precipitation, heat, wildfire, and wind. Specifically, more extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and snowstorms, have occurred in recent years. This requires stakeholders to better prepare transportation infrastructure resilience in planning, design, construction, and management. Its importance is manifested through nationwide policy and state-level practice. For example, in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the FHWA directs all state DOTs to incorporate resilience in their transportation asset management plans. A critical element in resilience is to evaluate the effect of climatic or environmental stressors on facilities’ performance. This study examines the impact of flood on the TxDOT-managed pavement network. It proposes a method to evaluate the flood-vulnerable pavement network in the context of resilience. First, the GIS tool is used to overlap a 100-year frequency flood with the road network to identify weak pavement sections subject to flood risk. Second, a simulation is run to determine sections affected by flood over a 10-year analysis horizon. Then, different deterioration models are used to predict the network-level pavement performance, to reflect (1) normal deterioration without flood, (2) optimistic accelerated deterioration under flooding, and (3) pessimistic accelerated deterioration under flooding. It is found that the network-level pavement will experience varying levels of performance reduction, owing to a 100-year flood impact. The quantified performance change can serve to enhance infrastructure resilience preparation for more reliable pavement system management.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/03611981231156934",""

Mediation analyses reveal compound indirect effects of pandemic job separation on psychological distress through the primary pathway of financial strain and the secondary pathways of social support, self-esteem, mastery, religious struggles, and sleep disturbance. Absent the indirect effect of pandemic job separation through financial strain, we would have failed to observe any simple indirect effects through the other proposed mechanisms. Formal moderated mediation analyses also indicate that our observed indirect effects are invariant to subgroup differences in current employment status, education, and household income.

Both issues are among the top concerns for hospital executives across the United States, yet some have questioned if the efforts to enhance quality are financially sustainable. Thus, the aim of this study is to examine if efforts to improve quality in the hospital setting have a corresponding association with hospital profitability. Recent and directly relevant research on this topic is very limited, leaving practitioners uncertain about the wisdom of their investments in interventions which enhance quality and patient safety. We assessed if eight different quality measures were associated with our targeted measure of hospital profitability: the net patient revenue per adjusted discharge. Using multivariate regression, we found that improving quality was significantly associated with our targeted measure of hospital profitability: the net patient revenue per adjusted discharge. Significant findings were reported for seven of eight quality measures tested, including the HCAHPS Summary Star Rating (p < 0.001), Hospital Compare Overall Rating (p < 0.001), All-Cause Hospital-Wide Readmission Rate (p < 0.01), Total Performance Score (p < 0.001), Safety Domain Score (p < 0.01), Person and Community Engagement Domain Score (p < 0.001), and the Efficiency and Cost Reduction Score (p < 0.001). Failing to address quality and patient safety issues is costly for US hospitals. We believe our findings support the premise that increased attention to the quality of care delivered as well as patients’ perceptions of care may allow hospitals to accentuate profitability and advance a hospital’s financial position.","https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/11/20/2758/pdf",""

There is considerable ongoing debate concerning the relative advantages and disadvantages of surgical treatment (internal fixation or arthroplasty) vs nonoperative treatment for femoral neck fractures in older persons with AD. Methods: This retrospective cohort study compared the mortality, hazard ratio, and survival rate between operative and nonoperative treatments, controlling for patients' demographic information and baseline health status. The study population consisted of Optum beneficiaries diagnosed with AD who experienced an initial femoral neck fracture claim between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2017. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were applied to compare the treatment groups' post‐fracture survival rates and mortality. Cox regression was used to examine the survival period by controlling the covariates. Results: Out of the 4157 patients with AD with femoral neck fractures, 59.8% were women (n = 2487). The median age was 81 years. The 1‐year survival rate for nonoperative treatment (70.19%) was lower than that for internal fixation (75.27%) and arthroplasty treatment (82.32%). Compared with the nonoperative group, arthroplasty surgical treatment had significant lower hazard risk of death (arthroplasty hazard ratio: 0.850, 95% CI: 0.728–0.991, Discussion: The findings suggest that the operative treatment group experiences higher survival rates and lower mortality rates than the nonoperative group.

The roots for the common grain sorghum produce multiple small molecules that are released via root exudates into the soil to compete with other plants. Sorgoleone is one such compound, which suppresses weed growth near sorghum by acting as a quinone analog and interferes with photosynthesis. Since sorghum also grows photosynthetically, and may be susceptible to sorgoleone action if present in tissues above ground, it is essential for sorgoleone to be excreted efficiently. However, since the P450 enzymes that synthesize sorgoleone are intracellular, the release mechanism for sorgoleone remain unclear. In this study, we conducted an in silico assessment for sorgoleone and its precursors to passively permeate biological membranes. To facilitate accurate simulation, CHARMM parameters were newly optimized for sorgoleone and its precursors. These parameters were used to conduct one microsecond of unbiased molecular dynamics simulations to compare the permeability of sorgoleone with its precursors molecules. We find that interleaflet transfer is maximized for sorgoleone, suggesting that the precursor molecules may remain in the same leaflet for access by biosynthetic P450 enzymes. Since no sorgoleone was extracted during unbiased simulations, we compute a permeability coefficient using the inhomogeneous solubility diffusion model. The requisite free energy and diffusivity profiles for sorgleone through a sorghum plasma membrane model were determined through Replica Exchange Umbrella Sampling (REUS) simulations. The REUS calculations highlight that any soluble sorgleone would quickly insert into a lipid bilayer, and would readily transit. When sorgleone forms aggregates in root exudate as indicated by our equilibrium simulations, aggregate formation would lower the effective concentration in aqueous solution, creating a concentration gradient that would facilitate passive transport. This suggests that sorgoleone synthesis occurs within sorghum root cells and that sorgoleone is exuded by permeating through the cell membrane without the need for a transport protein.","https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/64ef3b44dd1a73847fd3b395/original/passive-permeability-controls-synthesis-for-the-allelochemical-sorgoleone-in-sorghum-root-exudate.pdf",""

As a first step in developing a coherent strategy for composite aircraft post‐crash forensic analysis, a series of vertical flame tests were performed on mechanically failed Cytec T40‐800/Cycom® 5215 graphite/epoxy unnotched compression, short beam strength, and in‐plane shear specimens. Visual inspection and scanning electron microscopy were used to examine the specimens fracture surfaces before and after fire testing. The fire‐induced damage included matrix decomposition, melt dripping, char, soot, delamination, and residual thickness increases. The composite thermal degradation was significantly influenced by the specimen stacking sequence, the fracture surface morphology, and the total available free surface area. In addition, microscopic inspection showed that char layers impeded heat conduction and oxygen transfer to the interior of the specimens resulting in less thermal damage to the underlying plies. Moreover, burned specimens with more available free surface area sustained more thermal degradation and fire combustion damage for a given fire exposure duration. Exposed fiber bundles from the fracture surfaces were susceptible to severe thinning and thermal oxidation, which destroyed critical fractographic failure features necessary for accident reconstruction.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/pc.27239",""

This study aimed to: 1) delineate prevalent spiritual needs among Chinese nursing home residents, including those with dementia; 2) elucidate the method employed by staff to identify these needs in non-verbal residents; and 3) expound on the strategies utilized by staff to fulfill these identified needs. Methods: In this qualitative exploration, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 administrators from faith-based nursing homes, chosen for their potential concentration of residents with dementia. Encompassing establishments across 14 Chinese provinces, interviews were conducted in the participants’ native language, subsequently translated into English. Utilizing a constant comparative approach, the collected data underwent analysis to uncover recurring themes. Results: The analysis yielded five interconnected themes concerning the spiritual needs of older adults: expression of faith, reception of love and care, familial interaction, social engagement, and participation in activities. For individuals with dementia unable to articulate their needs, staff employed careful observation and communication with family members as means of identification. In response to identified needs, staff harnessed local resources and personalized services whenever feasible. Discussion: The findings offer practical insights for holistic caregivers catering to the spiritual needs of Chinese elderly.

This study examines how the presence of child passengers can affect driving behavior considering sociodemographic characteristics such as driver’s age, gender, ethnicity, employment, and driving aggressiveness. The current study used resourceful, open-source data based on urban areas in Texas to identify the key patterns of speeding behavior and associated safety surrogates in the presence or absence of child occupants. A unique data analysis procedure known as Taxicab Correspondence Analysis (TCA) was used to analyze the data. The results indicate that speeding patterns are affected by child occupancy during a trip. The results find that regardless of the presence of child passengers, female and unemployed drivers are more likely to drive defensively and male and employed drivers are more likely to drive aggressively. The findings also indicate that drivers from the young age group (20–29 years old) are strongly associated with speeding trips without child occupancy. However, young parent drivers from this age group are strongly associated with non-speeding trips and driving defensively. The study also finds that the impact of child occupancy on driving behaviors varies across different ethnicities. These findings will benefit transportation agencies in identifying aggressive driver groups and developing countermeasures to mitigate speeding behaviors, especially for trips with child occupancy.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/03611981231188374",""

We conducted latent class analysis using 12 indicators: associational (time with pets, frequency of in-person and virtual contact), structural (pet ownership and living arrangement), functional (receiving/providing support), and affectual (better relations). We used analysis of variance and post hoc analyses to determine whether individual differences (i.e., demographics, health status, and pandemic-related stressors), and well-being differed across typologies.

There was no change (P = 0.55) in White students’ sense of belonging as a result of the tour, from 4.33 ± 0.16 to 4.39 ± 0.44. However, there was a change (P ≤ 0.01) in ethnoracial minority students’ sense of belonging, from 3.73 ± 0.23 to 4.37 ± 0.27. There was no change (P = 0.36) in imposter tendencies from the pre-test (58.76 ± 2.46) to the post-test (60.52 ± 2.79). Ultimately, participating in the tour increased ethnoracial minority, but not White, students’ sense of belonging and did not impact imposter syndrome tendencies across or within ethnicity/race. One benefit of implementing experiential learning opportunities in dynamic social environments is the potential to improve students’ sense of belonging, especially in disciplines and careers where ethnoracial minority people are underrepresented.","https://academic.oup.com/tas/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/tas/txad001/48547088/txad001.pdf",""

Psilocybin is mistakenly perceived as the principal pharmacologically active compound due to its high concentrations found in magic mushrooms; however, it is the prodrug of psilocin. Despite the expanding body of clinical research seeking to understand the pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic properties of psilocin, and its role in inducing dramatic changes to cognitive function, there has not been a corresponding increase in the development of sensitive analytical methods that can quantify psilocin in different biological fluids. Existing analytical methods have been developed using plasma, serum, and urine as the matrix of choice, but with the unknown blood‐to‐plasma ratio of psilocin, any pharmacokinetic conclusions drawn solely on plasma data may be misleading. Thus, the main objective of this study is to develop the first analytical method that utilizes SPE and LC–MS/MS to quantify psilocin in human whole blood. The SPE procedure yielded a high recovery efficiency (≥89%) with minimal matrix effects. The method was validated according to ANSI/ASB 036 guidelines. Linearity was between 0.7–200 ng/mL and encompassed previously reported ranges found in plasma/serum. Bias, within‐ and between‐run precision for all quality controls met ANSI/ASB 036 acceptability criteria. Endogenous/exogenous interferences and carryover were negligible. Psilocin stability was assessed at 4°C over 48 h and was considered stable. Although a proof‐of‐concept study will need to be performed to characterize the method, this analytical workflow was able to detect and quantify psilocin in human whole blood at low limits of quantification.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1556-4029.15454",""

The process involved the manual combination of virgin binder PG 64-22 with crumb rubber modifier (CRM), which was heated to condition it. The preconditioned rubberized binder was then modified for two hours at a high speed of 8000 rpm using wet mixing. The second stage modification was performed in two parts, with part 1 using only crumb rubber as the modifier and part 2 involving the use of kaolinite and montmorillonite nano clays at a replacement percentage of 3% to the original weight of the binder along with the crumb rubber modifier. The Superpave and multiple shear creep recovery (MSCR) test methods were used to calculate the performance characteristics and separation index % of each modified binder. The results showed that the viscosity properties of kaolinite and montmorillonite improved the performance class of the binder, with montmorillonite demonstrating greater viscosity values than kaolinite even at high temperatures. Additionally, kaolinite with rubberized binders showed higher resistance to rutting, and the % recovery value from multiple shear creep recovery testing indicated that kaolinite with rubberized binders was more effective than montmorillonite with rubberized binders, even at higher load cycles. The use of kaolinite and montmorillonite reduced phase separation between the asphaltene phase and rubber-rich phase at higher temperatures, but the performance of the rubber binder was affected by higher temperatures. Overall, kaolinite with the rubber binder generally demonstrated greater binder performance.","https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/16/11/3902/pdf",""

Heifers were allotted on d -1 into four treatments: sourced from SD and finished in SD (SD-SD), sourced from SD and finished in TX (SD-TX), sourced from TX and finished in SD (TX-SD), and sourced from TX and finished in TX (TX-TX). Heifers were weighed on d -1, 3, 15, 28, 56, 78 (TX-TX and SD-TX) and 90 (SD-SD and TX-SD). On d 0, SD-TX and TX-SD heifers were shipped to the finishing location and weighed the following morning (d 1) to determine transportation shrink. To monitor transportation effects, vaginal temperature probes were inserted into all SD-TX and TX-SD heifers and a portion of SD-SD and TX-TX heifers on d -1 and removed on d 3. Clinical attitude scores (CAS) were recorded on d -1, 0, 1, 2 and 3 for indications of bovine respiratory disease symptoms. The GLIMMIX procedure of SAS was used to analyze growth performance and carcass measures with fixed effects of origin and finishing state. The MIXED procedure was used for CAS and temperature data with the same fixed effects and time as a repeated measure. Transported heifers had reduced temperatures (P &lt; 0.05) during transit and post-transit compared with non-transported heifers. Temperatures of transported heifers increased (P &lt; 0.05) during loading and unloading. On d 0, 1 and 3 there was a shift in the distribution of heifers that had a CAS score greater than 0 for TX-TX, SD-TX and TX-SD.

All cumulative growth performance measures and carcass trait interactions were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) besides initial BW, percent shrink of transported heifers, average daily gain, dressing percent, ribeye area and liver abscess severity, which were similar (P &gt; 0.30). There was a shift in the distribution (P &lt; 0.05) towards a greater proportion of Yield Grade 1 and Select carcasses for heifers fed in TX compared with those fed in SD, likely due to fewer days on feed. Overall, heifers transported to higher ambient temperatures had reduced dry matter intake, quality grades (QG) and limited growth recovery (45 kg lighter) compared with non-transported heifers. Heifers transported to lower ambient temperatures recovered growth and had improved QG at the same level of rib fat compared with non-transported heifers.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/101/Supplement_3/238/52957521/skad281.288.pdf",""

Recent studies focusing on resilience (a person’s adaption to the physical and psychological demands of providing care) showed higher levels of resilience in caregivers was inversely related to depression, burden, and anxiety (Lopes Da Rosa et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2021). With resilience being a protective factor against burden in caregivers, it is imperative to understand what psychological characteristics act as predictors of resilience. Participants (N = 59) completed questionnaires about resilience, mental health, and knowledge of Alzheimer’s disease. A classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was conducted to evaluate caregiver psychological characteristics as possible predictors of resilience.

The interaction between solute and solvent molecules intricately impacts solubility, reactivity, stability, and various chemical processes. Continuum solvation models gained prominence in quantum chemistry by implicitly capturing these interactions and enabling efficient investigations of diverse chemical systems in solution. In comparison, continuum solvation models in condensed matter simulation are very recent. Among these, the self‐consistent continuum solvation (SCCS) and the soft‐sphere continuum solvation models (SSCS) have been among the first to be successfully parameterized and extended to model periodic systems in aqueous solutions and electrolytes. As most continuum approaches, these models depend on a number of parameters that are linked to experimental or theoretical properties of the solvent, or that can be tuned based on reference data. Here, we present a systematic parameterization of the SSCS model for over 100 nonaqueous solvents. We validate the model's efficacy across diverse solvent environments by leveraging experimental solvation‐free energies and partition coefficients from comprehensive databases. The average root means square error over all the solvents was calculated as 0.85 kcal/mol which is below the chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol). Similarly to what has been reported by Hille et al.

This study sought to examine patterns of change in AMH in relation to skeletal maturity. Demographics, anthropometry, hand-wrist radiographs, and cardiometabolic risk factors from 88 females (212 observations), between the ages of 8 to 18 years from the Fels Longitudinal Study were used in this study. AMH was analyzed using ELISA from stored frozen serum samples. Generalized linear mixed effect modeling was used. In the stepwise regression models, log-transformed AMH (AMHlog) was regressed on relative skeletal age as the skeletal maturity indicator (calculated as chronological age minus skeletal age) and adjusted for chronological age, adiposity, and cardiometabolic risk factors. Skeletal maturity significantly predicted lower AMHlog (β= -0.073, SE=0.032, p=0.023). Glucose was significantly associated with decreases in AMHlog (β= -0.008, SE=0.004, p=0.044).

However, some research points to a “backlash” effect wherein gains in gender equality are associated with heighted sexual violence (SV) against women. In this study, we compare SV against undergraduate women majoring in STEM disciplines to those majoring in non-STEM disciplines. Data were collected between July and October of 2020 from undergraduate women ( N = 318) at five institutions of higher education in the United States. Sampling was stratified by STEM versus non-STEM majors and male-dominated versus gender-balanced majors. SV was measured using the revised Sexual Experiences Survey. Results indicated that women majoring in STEM disciplines that are gender balanced reported more SV victimization in the form of sexual coercion, attempted sexual coercion, attempted rape, and rape compared to their peers in both gender-balanced and male-dominated non-STEM and male-dominated STEM majors. These associations held even after controlling for age, race/ethnicity, victimization prior to college, sexual orientation, college binge drinking, and hard drug use during college. These data suggest that the risk of repeated SV victimization within STEM populations may be a threat to sustained gender parity in these fields and ultimately to gender equality and equity. Gender balance in STEM should not be furthered without addressing the potential use of SV as a potential means of social control over women.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/08862605231155124",""

While many couples end their relationship following infidelity, a significant portion choose to stay together and attempt reconciliation. In our study, we employed constructivist grounded theory to study the process of healing from infidelity for couples who stay together. Our sample consisted of 16 heterosexual couples who experienced sexual infidelity, chose to stay together, and self-identified as having experienced meaningful healing. Couples had an average age of 27 (range = 19– 46), approximate mean length of relationship at infidelity of 3 years (median = 2 years), and approximate mean time since infidelity of 50 months (median = 24 months). We organize our results into a process model of healing that includes four stages: the revelation of the infidelity, initial reactions, stabilizing the relationship, and revitalizing the relationship. The grounded theory suggests there is a developmental progression of healing as couples jointly work to re-establish their relationship. This process includes assessing the damage, affirming commitment, establishing accountability, seeking reconnection, communicating deeply, re-establishing trust, and moving from initial to deeper forgiveness. Our results also suggest that couples’ shared history, sociocultural factors, and receipt of formal and informal support shaped how they experienced the infidelity and engaged in healing. We discuss key clinical implications of the grounded theory, especially related to the role therapy can play in facilitating healing, the importance of open communication and processing emotions, deepening forgiveness, and the reciprocal process of restoring trust.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/02654075231177874",""

We predict that analysts' industry‐level information advantage is more likely to exist in industries where firm performance is more sensitive to industry‐level external economic forces. We find that for such firms, analysts provide relatively more accurate earnings forecasts compared to managers. Consistent with our predictions, we further find that managers of such firms provide fewer and less precise forecasts and that this association is more pronounced in firms with higher analyst following. Collectively, these findings suggest that analysts have an industry‐level information advantage over managers when forecasting earnings for firms in industries with high sensitivity to external forces, and that industry sensitivity risk is a distinct industry characteristic that affects firm‐level disclosure.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1911-3846.12837",""

However, conventional genotyping occurs at the individual level and is fiscally and logistically taxing for commercial cattle producers for whole-herd testing. Therefore, our research objective was to utilize DNA pooling methodology and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to introduce economically feasible genomic testing in commercial feedlot cattle. A total of 1,956 commercial mixed-breed feedlot cattle (1,715 steers; 241 heifers) with accompanying complete carcass date were enrolled in the project after having their DNA extracted from tissue sampling units collected during feedlot enrollment. Isolated DNA was stratified into 79 pools (mean pool size = 25 individuals) for genotyping via GGP Bovine 100K array (Illumina); pooling was designed to replicate a prospective timeline, utilizing lot number, arrival date, and feedlot entry weight to stratify DNA pools. Data preparation with outlier filtering (OF) and repeated measures (RM) reduced phenotypic variance within pools by removing pools containing outliers, defined as values greater than 150% of the IQR outside of the IQR, and replicating a pool genotype by the number of individuals in a pool to compare to individual phenotype, relying on the concept that pooled DNA is a proxy average of individual genetic makeup, respectively. To complete the GWAS, phenotype files were built using pool average and individual calculated yield grade (CYG) and marbling (MARB) values. To evaluate economic feasibility, we performed a cost comparison of the pooling process itself as compared with individual genotyping, in addition to a cost-benefit analysis for prospective pooling to display the potential increase in income because of the investment in genotyping. Completed GWAS identified 20, 10, 27, and 16 significant SNPs associated with RM CYG, OF CYG, RM MARB, and OF MARB, respectively (P ≤ 0.001). The estimated total cost of genotyping the pooled DNA in the project ($23,460) was 4.5 times less than the estimated cost of genotyping the same cattle individually ($105,354), and the mean potential benefit-cost ratio of utilizing pooled genotypes to make management decisions was 2.33 (SD = 1.91).Our research demonstrated the successful use of DNA pooling in a commercial feedlot setting and showcased a need for further research and more exploration to better define a successful prospective pooling process. Although the dataset was highly variable, these biologically logical associations signify relative success of utilizing pooled DNA in GWAS. The economic efficiency of the DNA pooling process itself warrants further testing, as the economic benefits the process can provide producers outweigh costs.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/101/Supplement_3/382/52958111/skad281.453.pdf",""

A national sample of grandparents were surveyed using a multi-scale index of psychological distress, reliance on intrapersonal resources during the pandemic, as well as sociodemographics. An initial hierarchical regression analysis of caregivers’ emotional adjustment was conducted, wherein (1) sociodemographic variables were first entered as a set followed by 2) a 17-item measure of COVID demands (alpha = .73), 3) two indices of grandparent intrapersonal resources [resilience and empowerment/social support and religious coping], and 4) two indices of psychosocial stress [parental distress, health, social/emotional and loneliness/parental distress, parent-child dysfunction, difficult child and parenting challenges]. The overall model was statistically significant (F 11, 123 = 22.98, p &lt; .01), accounting for 64% of the variance in grandparent adjustment difficulties. While sociodemographics and COVID demands failed to predict emotional distress, both categories of grandparent intrapersonal resources (p &lt; .01), and both categories of psychosocial stress (p &lt; .01) did so. Subsequent correlational findings indicated that intrapersonal resources (social support and religious coping) mediated the relationship between COVID demands and emotional adjustment. These findings suggest that while grandparent caregivers experienced significant emotional distress during the pandemic, reliance upon the support of others as well as their own intrapersonal resources may be instrumental in managing such distress.","https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/7/Supplement_1/530/54740641/igad104.1740.pdf",""

Thus, insight into variation in antler size requires understanding the connection between antler and body size, which can be summarized through ontogenetic and static scaling relationships. Both types of scaling relationships are also needed to examine the influence of factors besides body mass on antler growth at different ages and whether the effects of these factors diminish with age. Dietary and maternal effects might decline with age as individuals attempt to mitigate size deficits. We examined the potential effects of diet and maternal attributes of dam (mother) age at birth and litter size on body–antler mass relationships throughout ontogeny and at discrete ages. Data on age, maternal characteristics, body mass, and antler mass were gathered from captive, pen-raised White-tailed Deer (n = 168) that consumed either a low-energy (1.77 kcal/g) or standard-energy diet (2.65 kcal/g) from the time they were weaned until they perished by 5.5 years of age. Both types of scaling relationships were estimated with linear mixed-effects models to account for repeated measurements of males, dams, and sires. Diet affected ontogenetic scaling relationships. Males eating the low-energy diet had faster antler growth when young and lighter in body mass than when they were older and heavier—whereas males fed the standard-energy diet had a similar rate of antler growth across the range of body masses. A Bayesian Information Criterion model selection analysis indicated that diet and litter size (singleton, multiple births), but not dam age at birth influenced static scaling relationships. Static scalar coefficients up to 3.5 years of age were positively allometric (&gt;1.0), but isometric (1.0) in 4.5- and 5.5-year-old males. Furthermore, diet and litter size influenced both intercepts and slopes in only the youngest males (1.5 years) indicating that dietary and maternal effects can diminish with age. Body–antler mass relationships are complex. Young males that are small because of maternal effects, for example, might still be able to mitigate smaller body and antler sizes at older ages.","https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article-pdf/105/1/134/56572065/gyad120.pdf",""

However, less commonly studied is the ability of spectral indices and Burn Ratios to estimate field-measured fire effects. Past research has shown low correlations between fire effects and Landsat-derived Burn Ratios, but with the launch of the Sentinel-2 constellation, more spectral bands with finer spatial resolutions have become available. This paper explores the use of several red-edge-based indices and Burn Ratios alongside more ‘traditional’ spectral indices for predicting fire effects, measured from the Maple and Berry fires in Wyoming, USA. The fire effects include ash depth, char depth, post-fire dead lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta; PICO) density/stumps, mean basal diameter, cone density on dead post-fire trees, coarse wood percent cover/volume/mass, percent cover of ghost logs and initial regeneration of post-fire PICO/aspen density. All-possible-models regression was used to determine the best models for estimating each fire effect. Models with satisfactory R2 values were constructed for post-fire dead PICO stumps (0.663), coarse wood percent cover (0.691), coarse wood volume (0.833), coarse wood mass (0.838), ash depth (0.636) and percent cover of ghost logs (0.717). Red-edge-based indices were included in all of the satisfactory models, which shows that the red-edge bands may be useful for measuring fire effects.","https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/14/7/1508/pdf",""

These methods decompose signal matrices from each view into the sum of shared and individual structures, which are further used for dimension reduction, exploratory analyses, and quantifying associations across views. However, existing methods have limitations in modeling partially-shared structures due to either too restrictive models, or restrictive identifiability conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a new formulation for signal structures that include partially-shared signals based on grouping the views into so-called hierarchical levels with identifiable guarantees under suitable conditions. The proposed hierarchy leads us to introduce a new penalty, hierarchical nuclear norm (HNN), for signal estimation. In contrast to existing methods, HNN penalization avoids scores and loadings factorization of the signals and leads to a convex optimization problem, which we solve using a dual forward–backward algorithm. We propose a simple refitting procedure to adjust the penalization bias and develop an adapted version of bi-cross-validation for selecting tuning parameters. Extensive simulation studies and analysis of the genotype-tissue expression data demonstrate the advantages of our method over existing alternatives.","https://academic.oup.com/biometrics/article-pdf/79/4/2933/56385130/biometrics_79_4_2933.pdf",""

Current industry standards of by “eye” measuring results in a sort loss greater than 10% in most loads. Stationary imaging systems to predict BW have been developed to help producers better market their pigs at the appropriate BW; however, they can be costly and still require stockpersons to individually mark relevant pigs. Flank to Flank measurements using a cloth tape have been found suitable for predicting breeding sow and boar weights. The objective of the study was to establish a linear equation based on body measurements (body length, heart girth, and flank) to predict BW in finishing pigs. This study used 223 finisher pigs (121 gilts, 102 barrows), divided between 2 replicate groups (28.5 ±0.7 days). Measurements of BW, body length (base of neck to base of tail), heart girth (circumference around the chest), and flank (measurement was taken in front of hind legs from the bottom of one flank to the other sides bottom of the flank) were measured every 7 d beginning at 135 d of age until 163 d of age. Linear regression was used to establish equations for each body measurement alone and in combination and the R2 coefficient was used to compare predictability of equations. An R2 value of 0.76, 0.24, and 0.65 was found for heart girth, body length, and flank length, respectively. The linear equation from the greatest R2 value measurement was BW = 1.95 × (heart girth) - 101.78. The R2 value can be improved by combining multiple points of measurement provided added variable(s) make a significant contribution. The linear equation accounting for all three measurements [BW = (0.17 × length) + (1.49 × heart) + (0.12 × flank) - 122.98] had R2 = 0.78. The combination of body length and heart girth [BW = (1.45 × heart) + (0.87 × flank) - 118.94] resulted in an equation with a similar accuracy (R2 = 0.78) as all 3 measurements combined. Body length marginally improved the R2 value likely because it had a relatively low R2 value alone. The equation combining heart girth and flank explained the greatest proportion of the variation in BW, although there was limited additional value above heart girth alone. Within a commercial finisher barn, measuring heart girth of every pig may not be practical. However, this method could be suitable to train stockpersons for improved visual estimation of pig weight or to gauge overall barn performance based on a random sampling of pigs just prior to marketing.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/101/Supplement_2/254/52968203/skad341.289.pdf",""

Further, it may be that experiencing more race‐based discrimination may be related to using multiple substances to cope with such experiences; however, no known studies have examined the impact of race‐based discrimination on alcohol‐cannabis dual use. Methods: Participants were 270 Black undergraduates who endorsed past‐month drinking, 112 of whom endorsed alcohol‐cannabis dual use. Results: The dual use group reported heavier drinking, more drinking‐related problems, and more race‐based microaggressions (but not overt racism) than the alcohol‐only group. Conclusions: The use of cannabis among Black young adults who drink alcohol was related to heavier drinking and more alcohol‐related problems. Further, experiencing more microaggressions may place these individuals at risk for using multiple substances, presumably to cope with these experiences. Scientific Significance: Considering models suggesting that the dual use of cannabis may result in less alcohol use, the current study highlights that for Black adults who consume alcohol, cannabis dual use is related to heavier drinking and more alcohol‐related problems, which can inform intervention and treatment efforts.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ajad.13480",""

The even distribution of AgNPs was visible in the scanning electron microscopy images and a Fourier transform infra red study demonstrated major absorption peaks. The experimental results revealed that KA-CS-AgNPs exhibited exceptional adsorption efficiency for copper (Cu2+), lead (Pb2+), and Congo Red dye (CR), and showed potent antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The maximum adsorption capacity (mg g−1) of KAC-CS-AgNPs was 71.5 for Cu2+, 72.3 for Pb2+, and 75.9 for CR, and the adsorption phenomena followed on the Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm models and the second-order kinetic model (R2 > 0.99). KAC-CS-AgNPs also exhibited excellent reusability of up to four consecutive cycles with minor losses in adsorption ability. The thermodynamic parameters indicated that the adsorption process was spontaneous and endothermic in nature. The bacterial inactivation tests demonstrated that KAC-CS-AgNPs had a strong bactericidal effect on both E. coli and S. aureus, with MIC calculated for E. coli and S. aureus as 32 µg mL−1 and 44 µg mL−1, respectively.

Cannabidiol comes from the plant Cannabis sativa L. and binds to cannabinoid receptors throughout the endocannabinoid system. These receptors are located throughout the body and are prominent in the brain and reproduction tract. Although the effects of CBD on physiology have been researched, little data on the behavioral effects exist, even less so in horses. Calming supplements that may negate aggressive stallion behavior are not suitable due to potential soporific effects that can affect libido. In addition to the effectiveness of CBD to modify behavior in horses, it is also unclear if CBD influences stallion libido. The objective of this study was to evaluate sexual behavior in stallions given a daily CBD supplement for 70 days. Two-year old stallions (n = 8) were assigned to either a Control (CON; n = 3) or Cannabidiol (CBD; n = 4) treatment groups. Cannabidiol was administered at a rate of 0.6 mg/kg BW daily, and equal volume of olive oil was given as a placebo to CON. Horses were weighed every Monday at which time dosages were recalculated to adjust for body weight changes. Behavior data collection occurred twice per week during semen collections. Video data were recorded by placing two cameras, one placed in view of the tease area, and one placed in view of the mount, for behavior data backup. Behavioral data was tallied by handlers calmly calling each behavior as it occurred during collection. The behaviors collected included Flehman’s response, bites, strikes, mounts, high pitch vocalizations, and low pitch vocalizations. Data were analyzed using a Chi Square Test within R Statistical Program (R Core Team). Results were considered significant at P &lt; 0.05. Throughout the duration of the study, all stallions exhibited normal sexual behavior, regardless of treatment. Results showed that total low and high pitch vocalizations, bites, and Flehman’s were affected by treatment (P &lt; 0.01). Cannabidiol-treated stallions had more low pitches (60), compared to CON (58). Cannabidiol-treated stallions had fewer bites (145) compared to the CON (146). Cannibidiol stallions displayed Flehman’s more frequently (270) than CON (236). Flehman’s response and bites were lower for stallions on cannabidiol in Week 1 but increased by Week 10 (P &lt; 0.01), while only Flehman’s response increased in the CON group over time (P &lt; 0.01). These findings indicate that CBD may influence breeding behavior in young stallions specifically when supplemented over time. Further research should focus on the impact of CBD on breeding behaviors in mature stallions and the longevity of the behavioral response to CBD.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/101/Supplement_1/27/50196350/skad068.032.pdf",""

However, there is mixed evidence for the association between video game usage and poor sleep quality, short sleep duration, or delayed sleep timing. The current study examined associations between daily sleep behaviours and video game usage via a Bayesian and frequentist statistical approach. Caffeine and alcohol consumption were also assessed as moderators, as these behaviours may co‐occur with video game usage and poor sleep. 1032 (72% female) undergraduate students were recruited between 2006–2007. Participants completed questionnaires examining video game and substance use, as well as sleep diaries for 1 week. Frequentist analyses revealed that video game usage was related to increased variability in the total sleep time, and a later average sleep midpoint, but not sleep efficiency. Alcohol use moderated the relationships between video game usage and both average and variability in total sleep time. Caffeine use was related to shorter average total sleep time and more variability in sleep efficiency. Alcohol consumption was related to more variability in the total sleep time and sleep midpoint, and a later average sleep midpoint. Bayesian models suggested strong evidence that video game playing was associated with later average sleep midpoint. Like the frequentist approach, alcohol consumption moderated the relationship between video game usage and both average and variability in total sleep time, but the evidence was weak. The effect sizes for both approaches tended to be small. Using a rigorous statistical approach and a large sample, this study provides robust evidence that video game usage may not be strongly associated with poor sleep among undergraduate students.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jsr.13844",""

Mares were balanced by age, BW, and stallion pairing, and assigned randomly to dietary treatments of either supplemental l-arginine (50 mg/kg BW; n = 7) or l-alanine (100 mg/kg BW; n = 6; isonitrogenous control). Mares were individually fed concentrate top-dressed with the respective amino acid treatment plus ad libitum access to Coastal Bermudagrass hay. Treatments began on day 14 of gestation and were terminated at parturition. Mare BW, body condition score (BCS), and rump fat were determined, and body fat percentage was calculated every 28 d and concentrate adjusted accordingly. Doppler blood flow measurements including resistance index (RI) and pulsatility index for uterine artery ipsilateral to the pregnant uterine horn were obtained beginning on day 21 and continued every 7 d until day 154 of gestation, and prior to parturition. Parturition was attended with foaling variables and placental measures recorded. Placental tissue from the pregnant horn was analyzed histologically to assess cell-specific localization of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and cationic amino acid transporter 1 (SLC7A1) proteins. Semiquantitative analyses were performed using 10 nonoverlapping images per sample fixed in a 10× field (Fiji ImageJ v1.2). Mare performance data were analyzed using PROC MIXED in SAS and foaling and placental data were analyzed using PROC GLM. Gestation length at parturition was not influenced (P &gt; 0.05) by supplemental arginine. Compared with arginine-supplemented mares, control mares had a thicker rump fat layer (P &lt; 0.01) and greater percent body fat (P = 0.03), and BCS (P &lt; 0.01) at parturition. Arginine-supplemented mares had a lower RI than control mares prior to parturition (P &lt; 0.01). Body length, height, and BW of foals at birth, as well as placental weight and volume, and immunohistochemical staining for VEGF and SLC7A1 at parturition, were not affected (P &gt; 0.05) by maternal arginine supplementation.

Data included 1,291 repeated observations of CI and GL from 502 cows with 2,840 individuals in the pedigree, including 3 generations from the multi-breed herd of the livestock experimental station of the Panama Agricultural Innovation Institute (IDIAP) in Gualaca, Panama. The herd was composed of the following genetic groups based on their breed percentage: tropically adapted Brahman (BR), Nellore (Ne), Undefined Bos indicus (BI), Guaymi Creole (CR), Senepol (SP) and Romosinuano (RS); Bos taurus (BT), Simmental (SM), Angus (A), Red Angus (AR), Limousin (LM), Charolais (CH), Wagyu (Wa), and Others (Oth); crossbreeds (cx), Beefmaster (BF), Three CX (F1 x different BT), R1(Backcross BR), R2 (Backcross BT), Composite (combination of at least 4 different breeds with less than 25% of Zebu), Upgrade (87.5% BR 12.5% BT), B1 (62.5% Zebu + 37.5% BT), and B2 (62.5% BT + 37.5% Zebu). The Zebu influenced breed group represents 50.03% of this population, followed by the F1, the three CX, composites, and R1, representing 22%, 13.89%, 6.11%, and 5.34%, respectively. The other breed groups represented less than 2.5% of the population. A repeated records animal model was used to estimate variance components for both CI and GL. A bivariate animal model was used to estimate the genetic correlation between CI and age at first calving (AFC). Fixed effects for all models consisted of contemporary group, age of dam, calf sex, degree of outcross, and breed percentage. Contemporary group was defined by calving year and season of birth. The average CI was 572.6 ± 140 d, with a range of 315 d to 910 d; and the average GL was 284.2 ± 6.3 d. The estimated regression coefficient for CI on heterosis was -0.114 ± 0.10 d/heterosis % (P = 0.266), and for GL was -0.01 ± 0.052 d/heterosis %. A shorter CI was observed for the F1, and three CX, with 558.7 days and 567.2 days, representing a 2.3% and 1.3% reduction in CI, respectively, when compared with the Zebu group. A larger CI was observed for the Nellore and Romosinuano breeds % with 0.17 ± 1.23 d, (P = 0.373) and 0.64± 0.13 d (P = 0.406), respectively. A low heritability (0.037 ± 0.026) for CI was estimated, with a positive genetic trend over the duration of the study. The analysis between CI and AFC revealed a moderate genetic correlation (0.49 ± 0.36) that allows the establishment of a selection program to improve AFC and CI, which would improve the fertility of this multi-breed herd in Panama.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/101/Supplement_3/336/52958055/skad281.402.pdf",""

We present a novel age-dating technique based on perturbations to underlying gas hydrate stability caused by slide-impacted seafloor changes. Using three-dimensional (3-D) seismic data, we mapped an irregular bottom simulating reflection (BSR) underneath a submarine landslide in the Orca Basin, Gulf of Mexico. The irregular BSR mimics the pre-slide seafloor geometry rather than the modern bathymetry. Therefore, we suggest that the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) is still adjusting to the post-slide sediment temperature. We applied transient conductive heat-flow modeling to constrain the response of the GHSZ to the slope failure, which yielded a most likely age of ca. 8 ka, demonstrating that gas hydrate can respond to landslides even on multimillennial time scales. We further provide a generalized analytical solution that can be used to remotely date submarine slides in the absence of traditional dating techniques.","https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-pdf/51/4/387/5804207/g50930.1.pdf",""

However, the presence of the ramp may also alter pig behavior during the nursery period. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether ramp exposure affects pig behavior during the nursery period. We predicted that pigs exposed to a ramp would exhibit reduced aggressive behaviors, but similar eating, drinking, and postural behaviors during the nursery period compared with pigs not given access to a ramp. Two hundred four pigs (17 to 21 d of age) were placed in 8 pens (n = 24 to 27 pigs per pen) that were allocated to 1 of 2 treatments: 1) RAMP (n = 4 pens; standard commercial pen equipped with a ramp), or 2) CONTROL (n = 4 pens; standard commercial pen without a ramp). One day after placement (D1) and again 18 days later (D2), incidences of eating, drinking, aggressive, and postural (standing, lying) behaviors within each pen were collected for a period of 60 min at 0800, 1200, and 1600 h using a 5-min instantaneous scan sampling strategy. Data were analyzed using the GLIMMIX procedure in SAS with treatment, experimental day (D1, D2), hour (0800, 1200, 1600 h), and all 2-way interactions as fixed effects.

It is well established that cardiac autonomic function is impaired immediately following concussion.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the lasting impact of concussion on cardiac BRS and HRV in participants who are beyond 3 months from their last concussion. We hypothesized that cardiac BRS and HRV would be impaired in adults who previously had a concussion compared to healthy controls with no known history of concussion. Methods: Five adults (3 females, 27 ± 6 years; mean ± standard error) with a diagnosed concussion prior to assessment (6.2 ± 0.5 months) and six controls (3 females, 27 ± 5 years) without a known history of concussion were studied. Heart rate (HR; ECG) and beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP; finger photoplethysmography) were recorded continuously during a five-minute supine rest period. Spontaneous cardiac BRS was estimated using the Sequence Method for overall BRS gains, then separately for up gains (increase systolic BP: increase R-R interval) and down gains (decrease systolic BP: decrease R-R interval). HRV was measured in the time-domain using the root mean square of successive differences between normal heartbeats (RMSSD), and in the frequency-domain using normalized low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) power, and as the LF/HF ratio. Results: There were no differences in resting BP or HR between groups (P > 0.050 for both). Overall cardiac BRS gains was also not different between controls (20.3 ± 4.3 ms/mmHg) and participants with TBI (28.6 ± 9.3 ms/mmHg, P = 0.4116). Likewise, we found no group differences for up and down gains (P > 0.050 for both). For HRV measures, no differences between groups were observed for RMSSD (control: 63 ± 20 ms; TBI: 63 ± 21 ms, P = 0.890), LF power (control: 40 ± 9 n.u.; TBI: 40 ± 14 n.u.; P > 0.999), HF power (control: 56 ± 9 n.u.; TBI: 57 ± 14 n.u.; P = 0.940), or the LF/HF ratio (control: 1.08 ± 0.50; TBI: 1.49 ± 0.85; P = 0.792). Conclusion: These preliminary findings suggest that, in contrast to our hypothesis, adults at six months post-concussion do not demonstrate impairments in any indices of cardiac autonomic function.","",""

The outcome was delayed care, measured at four time points: during pregnancy and 1 week, 2 to 6 weeks, and after 7 weeks postpartum. The key covariate was insurance coverage denial by providers during pregnancy. Delayed care due to having an unaccepted insurance and being “out-of-network” was more pronounced at 1 week postpartum with 3.37 times and 3.47 times greater odds and in 2 to 6 weeks postpartum with 5.74 times and 2.97 times greater odds, respectively.

We framed this study by employing Hardiman et al.'s (2007) three‐dimensional matrix of oppression and used a mixed‐method research design.

Distracted drivers, unable to see advanced warning signals and pavement markings delineating the work-zone travel paths, could increase the likelihood of a crash. Recent statistics showed that fatal collisions in work zones had increased by 46% in 2019 compared with 2011. The frequency of roadway departures at work zones, the higher risk of fatalities, and little insight into encroachment types at work zones underscored the need for a thorough study. This study aimed to examine the vehicle encroachment conditions associated with work-zone locations and focused on 4 years (2016 to 2019) of crash data from the Texas Department of Transportation by applying a unique data-mining method known as cluster correspondence analysis. This method identified four clusters in both “no-injury” and “fatal and injury” crash data. Major factors contributing to vehicle encroachment were identified. Three dominating clusters were median-related crashes on two-lane divided high-volume roadways; single-vehicle overturning collisions on two-way divided roadways with unprotected median; and overturning crashes on two-lane undivided roadways in controlled traffic. The findings of this study will be useful for safety engineers to contribute to reducing encroachment-related work-zone crashes.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/03611981231152254",""

Few studies have been designed to experimentally induce abscesses with the purpose of identifying a time course, causality, and associated physiological implications. Therefore, we set out to develop a minimally invasive, reliable, and repeatable model to induce liver abscesses in calves in a controlled research environment to elucidate the genesis and etiology of the disease, with the ultimate goal of developing abscess reduction strategies. Experiment 1 was an attempt to induce abscesses by intraruminal inoculation with Fusobacterium necrophorum, Salmonella lubbock, and Truperella pyogenes (FST) following an intravenous lipopolysaccharide challenge. Holstein steers were harvested 3- and 10-d after inoculation, but no abscesses were detected. Experiments 2 and 3 involved diet manipulation by cycling calves on and off a high-starch, acidotic diet followed by intraruminal inoculation of microbes. In Experiment 2, Holstein calves were fed a negative control diet, an acidotic diet, and an acidotic diet plus bacterial inoculation with FST. No abscesses formed in the control or acidotic diet calves, but 43% of calves fed the acidotic diet with FST inoculation formed liver abscesses, suggesting that acidosis alone is insufficient to produce abscesses. In Experiment 3, treatments consisted of Holstein steers fed a negative control, an acidotic diet, an acidotic diet plus ruminal Fusobacterium necrophorum (F), and an acidotic diet plus Fusobacterium and Salmonella (FS). Again, there were no abscesses in the control or calves fed an acidotic diet alone; however, 40% of calves receiving F presented with an abscess, and 50% of the calves that received FS presented with abscesses. These data suggest that ruminal acidosis in conjunction with a ruminal load of pathogens commonly associated with liver abscesses provides a model that will induce liver abscesses. While the role of barrier dysfunction in the rumen and the lower gastrointestinal tract in formation of abscesses is not fully understood, this work provides a foundation to further explore the etiology of this disease and potential mitigation strategies.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/101/Supplement_3/69/52957296/skad281.083.pdf",""

Over seasonal and diurnal cycles, the plant must constantly adjust its metabolism according to available resources or external stressors. The metabolic changes that a plant undergoes in response to stress are well understood, but the long-distance signaling mechanisms that facilitate communication throughout the plant are less studied. The phloem is considered the predominant conduit for the bidirectional transport of these signals in the form of metabolites, nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids. Lipid trafficking through the phloem in particular attracted our attention due to its reliance on soluble lipid-binding proteins (LBP) that generate and solubilize otherwise membrane-associated lipids. The Phloem Lipid-Associated Family Protein (PLAFP) from Arabidopsis thaliana is generated in response to abiotic stress as is its lipid-ligand phosphatidic acid (PA). PLAFP is proposed to transport PA through the phloem in response to drought stress. To understand the interactions between PLAFP and PA, nearly 100 independent systems comprised of the protein and one PA, or a plasma membrane containing varying amounts of PA, were simulated using atomistic classical molecular dynamics methods. In these simulations, PLAFP is found to bind to plant plasma membrane models independent of the PA concentration. When bound to the membrane, PLAFP adopts a binding pose where W41 and R82 penetrate the membrane surface and anchor PLAFP. This triggers a separation of the two loop regions containing W41 and R82. Subsequent simulations indicate that PA insert into the β-sandwich of PLAFP, driven by interactions with multiple amino acids besides the W41 and R82 identified during the insertion process. Fine-tuning the protein-membrane and protein-PA interface by mutating a selection of these amino acids may facilitate engineering plant signaling processes by modulating the binding response.","https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6463e8a4a32ceeff2dc1d153/original/plat-domain-protein-1-plat1-plafp-binds-to-the-arabidopsis-thaliana-plasma-membrane-and-inserts-a-lipid.pdf",""

We first identified Venezuelans’ three main concerns during this time—shortage of food and necessities, economic crisis, and crime—and examined their relationships with the respondents’ trust in government and satisfaction with democracy. We found that shortages of food and necessities and increasing crime were negatively associated with Venezuelans’ trust in their government (although shortages were a more significant factor than crime). The long‐standing problem of economic crisis was not a significant factor in people's trust in the government. Furthermore, these three factors were not directly linked to Venezuelans’ satisfaction with democracy, but people who showed low levels of trust in government tended to have low satisfaction levels with Venezuelan democracy.

Previously we have shown that young adults with MDD produce greater T cell mitochondrial ROS compared to their heathy non-depressed counterparts. Because evidence from rodent models of stress-related mood disorders demonstrates that increased T cell mitoROS drives excessive proinflammatory cytokine production, we next sought to determine if either CD4+ (Helper) or CD8+ (cytotoxic) T cells likewise produce increased proinflammatory cytokines in young adults with MDD. We hypothesized that there will be elevated proinflammatory cytokine production in young adults with MDD compared to their healthy non-depressed counterparts. Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by density centrifugation from 5 young adults with MDD having mild to moderate symptom severity and 9 non-depressed young healthy adults. Interleukin 2 (IL-2), Interleukin 6 (IL-6), Interferon Gamma (IFN-γ), and Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-) production were assessed by flow cytometry. All data are expressed as mean SE and group differences were assessed by unpaired T test. Results: We found that adults with MDD exhibited a greater proportion of CD8+ Interleukin 6 (IL-6) (n= 8; 5 HA, 3 MDD) (HA = 22 3.5%, MDD = 255.6%; P= 0.004) producing cells compared to healthy. There were no significant differences in the proportions of CD8+ cells producing IFN-γ (HA = 14 1.2%, MDD = 3.1%; P= 0.31), IL-2 (HA =76 3.9%, MDD = 69 6.6%; P= 0.17), and TNF- (HA = 21 2.3%, MDD = 23.5%; P= 0.11) in those with MDD compared to controls. Additionally, there were no differences in CD4+ production of these same cytokines. We also assessed phenotype of the T cells using CD27 (central vs effector) and CD45 RA (Naïve vs TEMRA). Interestingly, a greater proportion of TNF- producing CD8+ and CD4+ cells exhibited an effector memory phenotype in adults with MDD compared to controls (CD8: HA = 25.8 2.4%, MDD = 46.8 3.3%; P= 0.0001; CD4+: HA=31 2.9%, MDD = 394.3%; P= 0.05). These data provide insight into the T cell subtypes that may be driving the inflammation associated with MDD. Conclusion: These preliminary findings suggest that young adults with MDD may exhibit a proinflammatory T cell phenotype characterized by greater IL-6 and TNF- production.","",""

In doing so, we focus on the role repeated certification contests play, where evaluators assess actors’ performance along particular dimensions and confer high status on the contest winners. Using the context of sell-side (brokerage) equity analysts and the “All-Star” list from Institutional Investor magazine, we first investigate whether analysts who make the All-Star list are more likely to produce accurate and/or independent forecasts. Then, we investigate analyst performance after recent and multiple wins. Our results demonstrate the decoupling of status and performance over time and the roles played by both the high-status actor and the social evaluators conferring their status. Whereas analyst performance increases the likelihood of being designated an All-Star, recent and multiple All-Star designations differentially affect both how subsequent performance is assessed, and how the All-Star analysts subsequently perform. In the short term, achieving high status can increase performance and solidify an analyst’s status position; however, in the long term, it can lead to lower performance and eventually result in status loss, which further erodes performance.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/orsc.2021.1563",""

For instance, higher staffing levels, particularly for registered nurses (RNs), have been associated with better resident outcomes. NHs have increasingly relied on contract nurse staffing to address pressing and persistent nursing shortages. Research suggests that contract nurses may be unfamiliar with institutional policies and procedures or organizational culture. They may require increased supervision, be less participatory in teamwork, and may increase the workload for the permanent staff. The objective of this study is to examine the association between contract nurse utilization and quality of care at US nursing homes.We used secondary data from PBJ nurse staffing, Nursing Home Compare, Healthcare Cost Report Information System (HCRIS) Dataset, and the American Community Survey (ACS) for the period 2017-2021. The dependent variable was CMS quality star rating, and the independent variables were contract nurse to total nurse proportions for each of RNs, LPNs, and CNAs. We employed multivariate random effects ordered logistic regression to test the hypothesis. We found that across all our three models (RNs, LPNs, CNAs), quality star ratings were negatively associated with contract nurse utilization. A 10% increase in contract nurse proportion was associated with a 10% decrease in the odds of reporting a higher quality star rating (OR=0.99, p&lt;0.001). Our results suggest the increased utilization of contract nurse staffing may have a negative impact on US NH quality---an important issue that has agitated policymakers for nearly three decades.","https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/7/Supplement_1/226/54739225/igad104.0746.pdf",""

We use the thickness of the layers of granulosa cells to differentiate primordial and primary follicles from secondary follicles. The measured dimensions and age-related follicular distribution agree well with histological images and physiological aging. Finally, we apply attenuation coefficient map analyses to significantly improve the image contrast and the contrast-to-noise ratio (p < 0.001), facilitating follicle identification and quantification.

We report on data constructed in a telecollaboration (a.k.a., virtual intercultural exchange) that we, four TESOL teacher educators, designed for teachers to discuss issues of social justice (particularly for minoritized immigrant students) and to have a discursive and experiential space in which to negotiate their language teacher identities (LTI). Gathering 117 teachers from five universities (three in Türkiye, two in the US) and underserved school districts in both contexts, this telecollaboration is our pedagogical, agentive response to dominant neo‐nationalist discourses in the two countries. To make quantities of data more manageable, we analyze interactions from one‐third of those 117 participants (five of 15 small groups) to address this research question: How do preservice and in‐service teachers from Türkiye construct their teacher identities in response to neo‐nationalist discourses in their sociopolitical context? In particular, how do they engage in this identity work through asynchronous small‐group discussions in a social justice‐focused telecollaboration with teachers from the US? Findings indicate that participants from Türkiye discussed teacher agency, conservatism and cultural difference in the society, and discrimination/xenophobia against refugees as important factors that shape their work with minoritized English language learners. They experienced tensions in their identity construction between their desire to advocate for their students and the external forces coming from meso‐ and macro‐level policies that impact their instruction and assessment procedures. We discuss our findings in relation to previous research on language teacher identity and social justice in sociopolitical contexts shaped by neo‐nationalist discourses. We also share the implications of our study for pedagogizing identity in teacher education.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/tesq.3245",""

We expand on prior studies demonstrating education’s link to cognitive function by examining how the complexity of one’s primary occupation also influences cognitive health. We hypothesize that cognitively demanding work, irrespective of education level, correlates positively with enhanced cognitive performance. Furthermore, we propose an additive effect, wherein high occupational mental demands amplify cognitive functioning beyond education’s influence. Our study uses data from 12,939 participants in the 2012 Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS) linked to an occupational database (Occupational Information Network O*NET). Employing generalized linear models to predict a summary cognition score, the findings unveil compelling insights. Both mental processes (β=0.17) and cognitive abilities (β=0.16) required in participants’ main occupations demonstrate positive correlations with cognitive scores (p&lt;.01). Education emerges as a predictor of cognitive performance and had a stronger relationship with cognitive functioning compared to occupational mental demands (β=0.79, p&lt;.01), highlighting the long-lasting effects of education in cognition emphasizing its role in shaping cognitive abilities throughout life. Adjusting for demographic and health factors reaffirms these associations. Moreover, our research introduces an innovative approach by creating an additive score for education and occupational mental demands. Our results reveal that the combined impact of education and mental demands is associated with higher cognitive scores (β=0.97, p&lt;.01).

DNA exhibits nonlinearity at strains far smaller than what is observed in conventional synthetic polymers. However, it is found that polydisperse calf thymus DNA does not exhibit the extreme strain sensitivity. By mixing samples of monodisperse DNA with the polydisperse calf thymus DNA, we correlate the molecular weight distribution (or polydispersity) to the onset of nonlinear viscoelasticity. We demonstrate that the strain sensitivity weakens as the polydispersity index increases. This is the first work correlating the inception of nonlinear viscoelasticity in entangled polymer system such as lambda DNA solution to the polydispersity of the samples. The experimental data suggests that ideally monodisperse polymer systems are very sensitive to the applied strain and have a very early transition to the nonlinear regime. We conclude that nominally monodisperse synthetic polymers are not sufficiently monodispersed to exhibit the early onset.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/pol.20230014",""

A comprehensive understanding of fluid behavior under diverse conditions, particularly in microgravity, is essential for optimizing the design and performance of these devices. This paper aims to investigate the effects of discontinuous wettability on droplet breakup structures under microgravity conditions using a microchannel wall. The approach we adopt is underpinned by the volume-of-fluid methodology, an efficient technique renowned for its accurate resolution of the fluid interface in a two-phase flow. Furthermore, a modified dynamic contact angle model is employed to precisely predict the shape of the droplet interface at and near the wall. Our comprehensive model considers influential parameters such as slug length and droplet generation frequency, thereby providing crucial insights into their impact on the two-phase interface velocity. Validated against existing literature data, our model explores the impact of various configurations of discontinuous wettability on breakup morphology. Our findings highlight the significance of employing a dynamic contact angle methodology for making accurate predictions of droplet shape, which is influenced by the wall contact angle. Emphasis is placed particularly on the effects of slug length and droplet generation frequency. Notably, we demonstrate that the use of a hybrid surface at the junction section allows for precise control over the shape and size of the daughter droplets, contrasting with the symmetrical division observed on uniformly hydrophilic or superhydrophobic surfaces. This study contributes valuable insights into the complex dynamics of the droplet breakup process, which has profound implications for the design and optimization of microfluidic devices operating under microgravity conditions. Such insights are further poised to augment applications in space exploration, microreactors, and more.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/5.0159118/18027249/072003_1_5.0159118.pdf",""

Although previous research has studied methylation patterns of individual tumor suppressor genes (TSGs), there has not been a comprehensive analysis of all available TSGs for breast cancer. The purpose of this study is to conduct the first-ever comprehensive statistical analysis of methylation patterns for all 1,217 TSGs. The authors analyzed publicly available Illumina 450K array data for 53 living (53-Alive) and 32 deceased (32-Dead) breast cancer patients. First, they studied the overall methylation distribution. They then identified differentially methylated (DM) sites between tumors and matched normal tissues in both Alive and Dead samples. They analyzed co-methylation patterns related to these DM sites and reported corresponding TSGs and non-TSGs. Results Below are the key findings of this study. First, tumor tissues had more heterogeneous methylation sites than normal tissues (40% vs. <10%) in both Alive and Dead samples. Second, there were significantly more DM sites in Dead than in Alive samples. Third, co-methylation patterns were investigated by calculating the Spearman correlation coefficients between each DM site and all 391,459 CG sites for both Alive and Dead samples. In normal tissues, some DM sites tended to have strong co-methylation with many other CG sites. In tumor tissues, some of these strong co-methylations were lost and some new co-methylation relationships were developed. These patterns were seen in both Alive and Dead data. Fourth, there were more co-methylation changes between normal and tumor tissues in Dead than in Alive samples. 30 TSGs and 92 non-TSGs were identified as having notable differences between Alive and Dead data. Finally, ESR1, PAX6, ZIC1, TP73, PPP1CA, POU6F2, and TFAP2A were involved in many different co-methylation changes between normal and tumor tissues. These 7 TSGs played a key role as hub genes in different networks. Conclusion Significant differences were identified for various methylation-pattern changes between normal and tumor as well as between Alive and Dead samples. These differences can be used to identify novel TSGs and biomarkers to improve breast cancer study.","https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3117749/v1",""

From 10,064 tight oil horizontal wells, 101 (1%) of the most productive wells by first-year oil production and 101 of the most productive wells by length-normalized first-year production are selected. We compare the completion, spacing, petrophysical, landing, and fluid properties between the most productive wells and others.

Average hydrocarbon-filled pore volume and oil formation factors still lead to high-performing wells. High pressure is an important consideration for Wolfcamp B top producers. All of the best oil producers have low producing gas-oil ratios. The top 1% of wells are usually the first well in the pad to be completed, and they come from above-average pads. The top 30% of completions lead to the top 1% of wells more often than extremely intense completions. Operators can apply these results to the further development of the Midland Basin.

In addition to human pathogens, untreated sewage contains high levels of micropollutants, organic matter, nitrogen, and phosphorus, potentially resulting in aquatic ecosystem impacts such as algal blooms, depleted oxygen, and fish kills in spill-impacted waterways. Our Geographic Information System (GIS) model, Spill Footprint Exposure Risk (SFER) integrates fine-scale elevation data (1/3 arc-second) with flowpath tracing methods to estimate the expected overland pathways of sewage spills and the locations where they are likely to pool. The SFER model can be integrated with secondary measures tailored to the unique needs of decision-makers so they can assess spatially potential exposure risk. To illustrate avenues to assess risk, we developed risk measures for land and population health. The land risk of sewage spills is calculated for subwatershed regions by computing the proportion of the subwatershed’s area that is affected by one modeled footprint. The population health risk is assessed by computing the estimated number of individuals who are within the modeled footprint using fine-scale (90 square meters) population estimates data from LandScan USA. In the results, with a focus on the Atlanta metropolitan region, potential strategies to combine these risk measures with the SFER model are outlined to identify specific areas for intervention.","https://peerj.com/articles/16429.pdf",""

The objective of this work is to propose framework to enable automated classification and ranking of manufacturing suppliers based on their online capability descriptions in the context of a supplier search and discovery use case. The proposed text analytics framework is supported by a formal thesaurus that uses Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) that provides lexical and structural semantics. Normalized Google Distance (NGD) is used as the metric for measuring the relatedness of terms when ranking suppliers based on their similarities with the queried capabilities. The proposed framework is validated experimentally using a hypothetical supplier search scenario. The results indicate that the generated ranked list is highly correlated with human judgment, especially when the search space is partitioned into multiple classes of suppliers with distinct capabilities. However, the correlation decreases when multiple overlapping classes of suppliers are merged together to form a heterogenous search space. The proposed framework can support supplier screening and discovery solutions by improving the precision, reliability, and intelligence of their underlying search engines.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/computingengineering/article-pdf/23/5/051011/7001379/jcise_23_5_051011.pdf",""

In young adults with major depressive disorder (MDD), there is some evidence that sympathetic outflow at rest is elevated and graded in relation to depressive symptom severity; however, few studies have examined arterial baroreflex function in young adults with MDD. Here, we tested the hypotheses that spontaneous baroreflex control of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) and heart rate (HR) would both be attenuated in young adults with symptomatic MDD (unmedicated) compared to healthy non-depressed adults (HA). Nine HA (22±3 yrs; 6 female) and 10 adults with symptomatic MDD of moderate severity [21±5 yrs; 8 female; 15±3 on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (possible score range: 0-27)] participated. MSNA (peroneal microneurography), HR (electrocardiogram), and beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP; finger photoplethysmography) were continuously measured during 10 min of supine rest. To determine spontaneous sympathetic baroreflex gain, weighted linear regression analyses between spontaneous changes in MSNA and diastolic BP (3 mmHg bins) were performed. To estimate spontaneous cardiac baroreflex gain, the relation between systolic BP and R-R interval was determined using the sequence technique. At rest, there were no group differences in MSNA burst incidence (28±10 HA vs. 21±10 bursts/100 heartbeats MDD; p=0.19), HR (62±9 HA vs. 69±11 bpm MDD; p=0.13), or mean arterial pressure (81±6 HA vs. 82±5 mmHg MDD; p=0.70).

Likewise, there were no group differences in cardiac baroreflex gain when derived separately during either BP rises or BP falls (both p>0.05).

When further classifying adults with MDD into symptom severity subgroups, there likewise were no differences in MSNA reactivity to either acute stressor (both p>0.05). Interestingly, adults with h-MDD exhibited greater increases in MAP than adults with l-MDD during the CPT (Δ28±9 h-MDD vs. Δ20±8 mmHg l-MDD, p<0.01) but not during the SCWT (Δ9±4 h-MDD vs. Δ11±7 mmHg l-MDD, p=0.63). Contrary to our hypothesis, these data demonstrate that neither acute stress-induced sympathetic activation nor the ensuing increase in BP are exaggerated in young adults with MDD. However, the severity of active depressive symptomatology may influence BP reactivity to generalized stress stimuli, thereby influencing CVD risk profiles.","",""

DO concentrations in karst spring flow involves complex hydrological processes because of the heterogeneous nature of the karst system. In this study, an interpretable and explainable model that integrates the shapley additive explanations (SHAP) algorithm with the long short‐term memory network model (LSTM) is proposed to evaluate the contributions of karst spring discharge, precipitation, water temperature, and specific conductance to DO concentrations in karst spring flow. The hybrid model can predict the temporal fluctuations of DO levels and provide a robust characterization of DO behaviours. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model, we adopted the hydrological and meteorological data from Barton Springs, situated within a highly karstified segment of the Edwards aquifer characterized by extensive fractures and openings. The optimal prediction performance is achieved with a 14‐day time step, which is considered as the effective response time between various hydrological processes and DO concentrations at Barton Springs. It reveals that the influence of karst spring discharge, precipitation, water temperature, and specific conductance in previous 14 days collectively contribute to the current DO concentration in karst spring flow. The SHAP values of input features provide both local and global explanations, demonstrating the magnitude and the direction of each feature's impact on DO levels in karst spring flow. In descending order, the contributions of various hydrological processes to DO are ranked as follows: precipitation, karst spring discharge, temperature, and specific conductance. Precipitation and discharge exhibit positive SHAP values, indicating that increases in these hydrological processes contribute to higher DO levels in the karst flow. Water temperature and specific conductance have negative SHAP values, suggesting that higher water temperature and specific conductance will lead to decreased DO levels in the karst flow.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hyp.14948",""

The pandemic highlighted worker safety inadequacies as well as system vulnerabilities to supply chain disruptions. One result has been political and media scrutinization of beef processing concentration as a culprit for these disruptions. Breaking plants up into smaller, more geographically dispersed processing could help mitigate risk from large plant closures but would likely result in higher retail prices because of lost scale economies. Additionally, improving worker safety likely means slower processing even in larger plants, again likely raising retail prices. We use a choice‐based conjoint analysis to examine to whether and to what extent consumers would be willing to pay higher prices to support smaller plant sizes and improved worker safety, among other beef characteristics. Findings of the study suggest that consumers do not care, at least directly, about plant size but are willing to pay to reduce food miles for processed beef (indirectly implying more geographic dispersion). Consumers are also WTP to improve worker safety.

Under investigation were Black women’s experiences of racial stress, specifically, perseverative cognition (PC) and anticipatory race-related stress (ARRS), and trauma symptoms.

Unique design modifications have recently been made possible through the design freedom allotted by additive manufacturing (AM). As one example, creating a rounded inlet for a film-cooling hole can mitigate separation at the inlet. This study explores various geometric features by exploiting the uses of additive manufacturing for shaped film cooling holes at engine scale. Both printability and cooling performance were evaluated. Resulting from this study, additively manufactured holes with hole inlet and exit rounding were printed with some variations from the design intent (DI). The largest deviations from the design intent occurred from dross roughness features located on the leeward side of the hole inlet. The measured overall effectiveness indicated that an as-built inlet fillet decreased in-hole convection as well as decreased jet mixing compared to the as-built sharp inlet. Including an exit fillet, which prevented an overbuilt diffuser exit, was also found to decrease jet mixing. A particular insight gained from this study is the importance of the convective cooling within the hole to the overall cooling performance. In-hole roughness, which is a result of additive manufacturing, increased convective cooling within the holes but also increased jet mixing as the coolant exited the hole. The increased jet mixing caused low overall effectiveness downstream of injection.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/turbomachinery/article-pdf/145/3/031017/6971115/turbo_145_3_031017.pdf",""

We use machine learning (ML) models to operationalize the likelihood of CEO deception as well as analysts' suspicion of CEO deception on earnings calls. Controlling for analysts' suspicion of deception, we show that analysts are prone to assigning superior recommendations to deceptive CEOs, particularly those deemed as All‐Star analysts. We find that the benefits of CEO deception are lower for habitual deceivers, pointing to diminishing returns of deception. This study contributes to corporate governance research by enhancing our understanding of analysts' reactions to CEO deception prior to public exposure of any fraud or misconduct. Managerial Summary: Undetected deception by CEOs can impact the stock market by influencing analysts' recommendations. Using an advanced ML model, our study measures the likelihood of deception more accurately than previous methods and identifies a tendency among financial analysts to favor deceptive CEOs, particularly high‐status analysts. However, deception is less effective with analysts who are repeatedly exposed to deception.

As one of the first few efforts, keyword extraction methods summarize an article by identifying a list of keywords. Many existing keyword extraction methods focus on the unsupervised setting, with all keywords assumed unknown. In reality, a (small) subset of the keywords may be available for a particular article. To use such information, we propose a rigorous probabilistic model based on a semisupervised setup. Our method incorporates the graph-based information of an article into a Bayesian framework via an informative prior so that our model facilitates formal statistical inference, which is often absent from existing methods. To overcome the difficulty arising from high-dimensional posterior sampling, we develop two Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms based on Gibbs samplers and compare their performance using benchmark data. We use a false discovery rate (FDR)-based approach for selecting the number of keywords, whereas the existing methods use ad hoc threshold values. Our numerical results show that the proposed method compared favorably with state-of-the-art methods for keyword extraction.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/ijoc.2023.1283",""

IACUC questions focused on the use of virtual interactions for IACUC activities and on remote work for IACUC support staff during and after the pandemic. ARP questions focused on remote work arrangements, altered work schedules, personnel shortages, and operational changes made during and after the pandemic. Results indicate that IACUCs readily adopted remote work options for staff and virtual meetings, changes that are now largely viewed as permanent, and are using modified methods for postapproval monitoring (PAM), while largely rejecting virtual semiannual facility inspections. This pattern reflects available guidance for virtual IACUC meetings, whereas new guidance for virtual semiannual facility inspections might have caused confusion and regulatory compliance concerns. Remote work options were available for some ARP staff, depending on job responsibilities, but were mostly eliminated by 2 y after the start of the pandemic. ARP staff expressed a strong desire for continued in-person presence of supervisors; this preference was not expressed by IACUC staff.

Additionally, we propose that work and family crafting behaviors (decreasing hindering work and family demands) are helpful in building resources that mitigate the relationships above. We tested these hypotheses by sampling 71 full‐time employees over a work week. The results identified positive relationships between changes in role overload and changes in WFBS. In addition, we found full support for the moderating role of crafting behaviors in the work domain and partial support for the family domain. Further analyses suggested that employees' work and family crafting behaviors (i.e., decreasing hindering demands) buffered the negative effects of changes in work and family overload on changes in work and family fatigue, respectively. Also, decreasing hindering work demands moderated the indirect effect of changes in work overload on changes in WFBS. We discuss theoretical and practical implications as well as future research directions.","",""

Woven geotextile was used to stabilize the soil and to address the lime problem, enhancing its strength and mechanical properties. This is considered of significant importance in civil engineering works. Subgrade soils, its properties like plasticity and strength are essential to the design of pavement structures and any road construction. Experiments were conducted to investigate the application of geotextile on lime stabilized lateritic soils under unsoaked conditions. Geotechnical experiments were conducted to determine Grain size analysis, Atterberg, compaction and California bearing ratio test. CBR tests were done by placing the geotextile at varying depths under unsoaked conditions to determine the soil's bearing capacity. The result shows that the strength of lateritic soil is visibly increased by introducing geotextiles at different layers in the soil. It is found that geotextile placed at one-half the distance from the base showed higher CBR value by comparison with layers one-fourth and 1/4&3/4 distances from the base. The strength of the laterites was improved to thereabout 50% of its original strength without any stabilizer. Geotextile requires minimal maintenance, corrosion resistance, no threat to human health and increases the service life of road pavement. Geotextiles should be considered when dealing with the problems with lime and as a modernized form of improving road construction on poor laterites.","https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3201480/v1",""

This heterogeneity suggests that growth mindset interventions should not be viewed as a sole solution for improving educational outcomes for students and that further research is needed to identify the contextual factors that influence their effectiveness. We propose new theoretical directions in mindset research that adopts an anti‐deficit model and moves away from focusing exclusively on students and their belief systems. Instead, we encourage a new wave of mindset research that considers the institutional, cultural, and contextual environment that either corroborates or negates students' mindset beliefs.

Thus, periprocedure care of these patients presents unique challenges, particularly for extensive surgical procedures that are increasingly scheduled for free-standing ASCs, where consultation and ancillary services, as well as access to percutaneous cardiac interventions, may not be readily available.

We explore this paradox in the present research. Results from five experiments (three online experiments and two lab experiments) confirm that consumers report being happier when spending time on high (vs. low) skill activities, and that the increased happiness from these high‐skill activities is mediated by increased “flow” from them. Expertise in an activity moderates this effect, such that those who are relative experts in a high‐skill activity experience increased happiness and meaning compared to those who are amateurs.

This presentation aims to discuss qualitative data obtained from 14 custodial grandmothers who participated in virtual focus groups to understand their parenting experiences in conjunction with meeting COVID-19 demands. Participants were recruited from a larger sample (N=145, age range 30-79 years, Mage = 61.4 years, SD = 8.5) of custodial grandparents who completed a quantitative survey on COVID-19 stressors. Guided by McCubbins and Patterson’s Family Stress and Adaptation model, three researchers conducted open coding of the focus group data. The analysis revealed distinguishing patterns related to managing challenges of grandchild caregiving brought on by COVID-19. Some grandparents discussed the demands of COVID-19 as difficult, but not as challenging as the day-to-day experiences of raising grandchildren. This was reflected when grandparents discussed raising grandchildren with special needs in the pandemic environment, advocating with schools to adjust virtual learning expectations, managing custody cases and social service home visits while ‘protecting’ grandchildren and themselves from COVID-19 exposure. Grandparents stated they did not change their parenting style to manage COVID-19 demands, yet they discovered a stronger, internal commitment to raising grandchildren. Grandparents reflected when isolating they enjoyed engaging in different and new activities with their grandchildren while becoming closer to them as a result. Findings suggest that challenges of raising grandchildren were heightened in the context of COVID-19 demands. Although grandparents experienced losses during the pandemic, they also reflected on gains related to their resourcefulness and resiliency in managing stressors.","https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/7/Supplement_1/258/54738448/igad104.0858.pdf",""

Increased academic success and program connectivity have been demonstrated when undergraduate students are engaged in research early in their degree programs. Despite the known benefits of undergraduates engaging in research, there are challenges associated with conducting undergraduate research programs. Reported barriers include the lack of student knowledge about research methods, lack of preparedness, and lack of student identification and understanding of their specific interests which may not facilitate research ideas and affinity to conduct research. Additional challenges are related to the lack of faculty resources (e.g., time, specific equipment, research space, etc.), the ability to train and supervise undergraduates who may have very limited or no research experience and those students who are true beginners lacking foundational skills. Moreover, involving, engaging, and supporting underrepresented students (e.g., first-generation college students, females, ethnic minorities) in undergraduate research experiences can require different approaches for mentors to be effective. The “Engaging Undergraduate Students in Research” workshop was organized by the Vice Presidents of the American Society for Horticultural Science (ASHS) Research and Education Divisions at the ASHS 2022 Annual Conference in Chicago, IL, USA. The workshop featured three speakers who described their experiences engaging undergraduate students in research. After each speaker provided comments for ≈5 minutes, the workshop attendees self-selected into three breakout groups with the speakers for roundtable discussions related to engaging students in research through coursework, engaging students via formal research projects, and engaging underrepresented students in research. After the breakout group discussions, a summary was given by each group, and whole group discussions and comments were facilitated.

The model allows firms' endogenous choice between exporting or FDI to impact the proportion of exporting firms and subsequently bilateral trade. Based on the theoretical results, we propose a three‐stage estimation procedure: First, estimate firm selection into horizontal FDI; second, use predicted probabilities from the first stage in the estimation of firm selection into exporting; and third, use predicted probabilities from the previous two stages in the gravity estimation of bilateral trade. We apply this procedure to the European Union (EU) processed food industry, which engages in worldwide FDI and trade. We estimate a baseline model of a standard gravity equation, a two‐stage model without FDI selection, and our proposed three‐stage model and quantify bias corrections in the coefficient estimates of the trade friction variables in the baseline and two‐stage gravity models. The bias corrections can be large. For instance, the inclusion of the proportion of Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) in the trade‐selection equation leads to a sign reversal of the distance coefficient estimate and results in an upward bias correction of . The three‐stage gravity corrects a downward bias of in the coefficient estimate of distance in the baseline but an upward bias of in the two‐stage method, which indicates that the two‐stage method overcorrects the downward bias in the baseline gravity.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ajae.12395",""

This approach fails to capture the variability in overt stuttering behaviors of persons who stutter across speaking tasks and over time. This preliminary study explored the relationships between day-to-day variability of stuttering and several commonly used self-report and behavioral outcomes used to diagnose and monitor stuttering in clinical and research settings. Method:: Five adults who stutter participated in this study. All participants completed a demographic questionnaire; the Overall Assessment of the Experience of Stuttering, State, and Trait Anxiety Inventory; and the Brief Version of Unhelpful Thoughts and Beliefs About Stuttering (UTBAS), followed by six (i.e., twice weekly) online sessions where conversation and reading samples were video-recorded to determine stuttering frequency and severity. Participants also rated their stuttering severity, variability, stress, anxiety, and sleep on a 7-point Likert scale for each session. Results:: No self-report measures correlated with stuttering frequency or severity measures determined at each twice-weekly online session. Positive correlations were observed between self-rated stuttering severity and stress, anxiety, and normal disfluencies. Stuttering variability across tasks and sessions was positively correlated with the one-time Overall Assessment of the Speaker's Experience of Stuttering (OASES) and UTBAS-6 scores. Conclusions:: Stuttering frequency was found to vary to different degrees for individual participants, and preliminary data suggest that scores on standardized assessments such as the OASES and UTBAS-6 are predictive of stuttering variability.

Using the New Immigrant Survey (NIS) and a simultaneous equation model (SiEM) approach, this article expands on this research by exploring the impact of channeling on wages for Asian Indians, Filipino/as, and Mexicans with lawful permanent resident (LPR) status. Contrary to prior findings on the effects of channeling within specific industries, we find that channeling is associated with lower, not higher, immigrants’ wages. The findings are robust to different definitions of channeling, as the negative effects of channeling hold within industrial sectors and occupational groups. Moreover, the results indicate that channeling is not exclusive to the Mexico–US migration stream, but instead may be a feature of various US-bound immigration streams, including those from India and the Philippines.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/01979183221149014",""

The statistical results showed that there were significant differences in the WD, the inundated road count, and the length inside/outside of HEC-RAS-modeled floodplain. The results also showed that a less consistent decreasing trend between the U-Flood data and the modeled floodplain over time and space. This study empirically evaluated the data quality of the VGI based on observed and modeled data in flood monitoring. The findings from this study fill the gaps in the literature by assessing the uncertainty and data quality of VGI, providing insights into using supplementary data in flood mapping research.","https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5338/10/5/113/pdf",""

The NH industry has attempted to address the persistent shortage of nursing staff by increasingly relying on contract nurse staffing. Research suggests that the increased utilization of contract nurses may have negative implications for NH quality and financial performance. However, all NHs are not equally likely to utilize nurse contract staffing. For instance, potentially, NHs with poorer quality of care and financial challenges may be forced to rely more on contract nurse staffing. The primary purpose of this paper is to explore the antecedents---facility and community factors---associated with increased utilization of nurse contract staffing. Employing a pooled cross-sectional observational study design, we extracted secondary data from the PBJ nurse staffing, Nursing Home Compare, Rural-urban commuting area (RUCA) codes, and the American Community Survey (ACS) for the period 2017-2021. To test the relationship between the ratios of contract nurses and facility/community factors, we employed multivariate mixed-effects maximum likelihood regression. We ran three separate regressions for RNs, LPNs, and CNAs. Our results suggest that among facility level factors, NHs with more beds, higher occupancy rates, and higher proportion of Medicare residents were generally more likely to employ contract nurse staffing with some minor differences across the three models (RNs, LPNS, CNAs). Among community factors, location in micropolitan/small town areas, higher poverty rates, and higher education levels were positively associated with nurse contract utilization. Policy and managerial implications are discussed.","https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/7/Supplement_1/226/54739233/igad104.0745.pdf",""

Although contract nurse staffing in NHs may provide a relatively flexible option to address acute nurse shortages, it raises its own challenges including requirement of increased supervision, lower levels of teamwork, and increased workload for the permanent staff. This may lead to disenchantment of the remaining nursing staff, increased turnover---a perfect vicious cycle. Therefore, we examined whether higher ratios of contract nurse utilization were associated with higher nurse turnover rates (RNs, LPNs, and CNAs). Employing a pooled cross-sectional observational study design, we extracted secondary data from PBJ nurse staffing, Nursing Home Compare, Rural-urban commuting area (RUCA) codes, and American Community Survey (ACS) for the period 2017-2021.

Our results suggest that NHs with a high proportion of contract nurses had higher nurse turnover rates for all the three types of staffing (RNs, LPNs, and CNAs). Moreover, NHs with high RN turnover rates had low RN staffing, higher CNA staffing, lower occupancy rates, and higher share of Medicaid residents. High nurse turnover can adversely affect resident outcomes—for instance, due to reduced continuity of care.

Oxacillinases (blaOXA-23), beta-lactamase (blaTEM-1D) are known to contribute to antibiotic resistance. The purpose of this study was to identify if resistance genes such as blaOXA-23 and/or blaTEM-1D contribute to adverse patient outcomes such as prolonged infection leading to increased duration of stay and mortality in hospitalized patients. Methods: Clinical patient isolates were collected from two acute care hospitals, a 383-bed, and a 248-bed hospital in the Detroit metropolitan area. A total of 115 isolates samples and with complete clinical data sets were collected from 2 medical ICUs, 2 surgical ICU wards and 12 non-ICU surgical wards between 2017-2021. Resistance genes were analyzed using Resfinder (version 4.0) following whole genome sequencing (Illumina, NextSeq). Separate Bayesian regression models were used for the outcomes of interest: length of stay (LOS) and 30-day mortality, for each gene, blaOXA-23 and blaTEM-1D, as a predictor and adjusting for age and sex, using negative binomial models for LOS and logistic regression for mortality. Full models were fit to each outcome that included the interaction of both genes and adjusted for age, gender, hospital unit, respiratory infection, diabetes, COPD, hypertension, and renal dysfunction. Results: The patient clinical characteristics between the resistant and susceptible Acinetobacter groups were matched (Table1). There was little evidence for the genes affecting either 30-day mortality or LOS for the full models. There was some evidence for increased odds of mortality with the presence of blaOXA-23, 0.75 (95% uncertainty interval: -0.06, 1.60), or both blaOXA-23 and blaTEM-1D, 0.85 (-0.2, 2.0) but not at the 95% level (Figure 1, Table 2). There was little evidence for an effect for the genes on LOS. Conclusion: Although there was a trend towards resistance genes affecting outcomes, the full analysis indicated no relationship between resistance genes and overall outcomes. Other factors such as advanced age, and comorbidities may be contributing to the mortality. In the future, factors that contribute to adverse clinical outcomes using a larger cohort will be explored.

Through a qualitative content analysis of 15 advice books published from 2013 to 2020, this article analyzes how women’s and men’s work relationships are depicted in popular press career advice books that are marketed for women. We identify three main themes. First, men are described as baffled by women’s “strange ways,” so women are warned to be aware of men’s uneasiness and tread carefully in their work relationships. Second, men are depicted as enemies, yet women are told to rely on powerful men to achieve success. Third, women are instructed to ignore and downplay sexism in their workplace interactions. We conceptualize the work that women are expected to do as “tightrope labor,” in which women must carefully navigate contradictory gender expectations. Women are expected to walk a tightrope with (1) handling men’s discomfort with women; (2) identifying “menemies” and mentors; and (3) managing sexism. We argue that relationship depictions in career advice fault women for career failures, burden them with extra labor, and bolster neoliberal feminist rhetoric.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/23294965231161782",""

However, if these tracking mechanisms fail, DNA recovered from the formalin‐fixed tissues/organs could provide an additional layer of quality assurance. Embalming fluids preserve biological tissues; however, they also damage, fragment, and cross‐link DNA and protein molecules. This project investigated the success of STR‐typing from various soft tissue and bone samples that were fixed with embalming solutions with a range of formaldehyde concentrations. Formalin‐fixed samples dissected from five cadavers, including skin, muscle, bone, heart, and kidney were used in Phase 1 of this study. In Phase 2, an additional 57 tissue samples from various embalmed organs and body parts were collected to demonstrate long‐term fixation and direct applicability within a body donor program. DNA was extracted from the samples using the QIAamp® FFPE Tissue Kit (QIAGEN), quantified with the Investigator® QuantiPlex® Pro RGQ qPCR Kit (QIAGEN), and amplified using the Investigator® 24plex and 26plex QS Kits and the Investigator® DIPplex Kit (QIAGEN). The results show the DNA was severely damaged, degraded, and often in low amounts (after one year post‐embalming). Sampling from skin and muscle tissues embalmed with ~2.5%–5% formaldehyde solutions appears to be the best strategy for identification, while also maintaining the preservation of the tissues. The results of this project can provide informative data when determining which genotyping strategy may be best suited for the identification, re‐association, and establishment of a database for the provenance of formalin‐fixed human remains.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1556-4029.15414",""

Dishonest business people and fish farmers unlawfully utilize various preservatives to avoid rotting and extend the shelf life of fish. Although previous research has examined the level of formalin use in fish bodies, no studies focusing on all aspects of fish adulteration and contamination in Bangladesh have been carried out. In this context, the aim of this review is to explore the extent and magnitude of illegal fish adulteration and contamination in Bangladesh. Among the 37 reviewed studies, 11 of them highlighted formalin adulteration in fish samples and fish feed. The extent of formalin use varied between local and imported fish, and between large and small fish. Imported and large fish were substantially more formalin‐contaminated. Several investigations have discovered that antibiotic levels in farm water and fish feed exceed the permitted level. Farmers have used growth promoters incautiously. This study also identifies that certain metal substances, such as chromium, lead, arsenic, cadmium, iron, mercury and cobalt, have been frequently found in fish bodies and feed samples. Furthermore, a distinct type of fish adulteration caused by aromatic compounds has emerged recently. The findings and their ramifications are extremely concerning for human lives. However, since each study employed a different testing kit, the results were quite distinct. Thus, the adoption of a precise and sensitive kit is strongly recommended. The government should make it a top priority to solve the problem of fish adulteration by implementing appropriate food safety laws and policies.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/raq.12801",""

Older adults have impaired heat-dissipating capabilities and are at a greater risk for heat-related morbidity and mortality. Many hospitalizations and deaths in this population during heat waves are due to renal complications. Indeed, age-related reductions in kidney function, altered fluid regulation, and impaired thermoregulation, may place the elderly at an increased risk for heat-related renal complications. Purpose: Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that aging augments heatwave-induced renal stress. Methods: We assessed core temperature, mean skin temperature, whole-body sweat loss, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) via serum creatinine in healthy older (8 Female/7 Male; 70±4 years) and younger (6 Female/7 Male; 29±4 years) adults exposed to three hours of 1) very hot and dry (DRY: 47ºC, 10% relative humidity) and 2) hot and humid (HUMID: 41ºC, 40% relative humidity) heatwave conditions on different days (random order). To simulate activities of daily living, participants performed seven 5-minute periods of light exercise (~3 METS; metabolic heat production: Old: 2.98±0.42; Young: 2.96±0.34 W/kg) dispersed across the heat exposure. Additionally, participants consumed 3 mL/kg/hr of tap-temperature water to maintain euhydration. We analyzed data from each heatwave condition independently using linear mixed effect models with main effects of time (pre and post) and group (Older and Younger) or unpaired t-tests, as appropriate. Repeated measures correlation was used to determine any relation between the change (Δ) in core temperature and Δ eGFR across both heatwave conditions. Results: Following exposure to DRY, older adults had greater increases in core temperature (Older: Δ 1.46±0.42, Younger: Δ 0.74±0.28ºC, interaction p<0.01), but no difference in mean skin temperature increases (Older: Δ 2.09±1.31, Younger: Δ 1.73±0.48ºC, interaction p=0.404) or whole body sweat loss (Older: 1479±391, Younger: 1556±542 mL, p=0.661). In addition, following DRY, eGFR decreased in older but increased in younger adults (Older: Δ -4.3±5.9; Younger: Δ 4.12±4.75 mL/min/1.73 m2, interaction p<0.01). Following exposure to HUMID, older adults had greater increases in core temperature (Older: Δ 1.09±0.29, Younger: Δ 0.55±0.28ºC, interaction p<0.01) and mean skin temperature (Older: Δ 2.43±1.05, Younger: Δ1.37±1.13ºC, interaction p=0.018), but no difference in whole body sweat loss (Older: 979±304, Younger: 1011 ± 269 mL, p=0.774). eGFR increased in younger, but not older, adults (Older: Δ 0.30±4.01, Younger: Δ 6.16±3.37 mL/min/1.73 m2, interaction p<0.01) following HUMID. There was a significant negative relation between Δ core temperature and Δ eGFR (r=-0.48, p<0.01). Conclusion: These preliminary data suggest that older individuals exhibit greater increases in core temperature during heatwave exposures that may contribute to reducedrenal function.","",""

Previously, our group has shown that ~75% of burn survivors have a maximal aerobic capacity in the lowest 20th percentile rankings, relative to sex and age-adjusted non-burned individuals. This level of impairment is strongly associated with cardiovascular-specific, as well as all cause, morbidity, and mortality. Moreover, burn injuries that require grafting impair thermoregulation, and the subsequent increases in skin and core temperature may dissuade these individuals from engaging in exercise and/or physical activity. Low-energy cooling strategies have potential to attenuate increases in core temperature in burn survivors, which may promote regular physical activity. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of low-energy cooling modalities on thermoregulatory responses during physical activity in the heat. Methods: Twenty-four adults with NO-BURN (n = 9), MODERATE burns (20-40% body surface area burned, n = 7), or LARGE burns (> 40% body surface area burned, n = 8) walked for one hour at a moderate intensity (rate of metabolic heat production of 4.5 W/kg body mass) in an environmental chamber (39°C, 40% RH). Burn survivors were at least 2 years post-injury. Participants performed this activity four times, with the following modalities randomly applied throughout each trial on separate days: no cooling (i.e., control), fan at 4 m/s (FAN), water spray (WS, minimum 10-50 g every 5 min, scaled to burn area size), or WS+FAN. Core temperature (Tcore) was recorded throughout each trial via a telemetric pill. Final Tcore values for each cooling modality were compared against the no cooling condition. Results: For the LARGE burn group, WS reduced end-exercise Tcore by 0.37°C (range 0.09 to 0.66°C) compared with no cooling ( p = 0.01). FAN and WS+FAN did not impact end-exercise Tcore for the LARGE burn group ( p ≥ 0.48). No cooling modality affected Tcore for the MODERATE burn group ( p ≥ 0.12) or the NO-BURN group (p ≥ 0.55). Conclusion: At the assessed workload and environmental condition, the efficacy of the applied cooling modalities on Tcore responses for burn survivors appears to be dependent on both the selected modality and the size of the burn surface area. Namely, WS attenuated the increases in Tcore in participants with LARGE burn injuries, but FAN and WS+FAN did not attenuate Tcore responses in any group.","",""

The significant loss of water and key nutrients from the body can put the animal at increased risk for bovine respiratory disease (BRD). It is hypothesized that rapidly rehydrating calves upon arrival may reduce disease risks by facilitating an easier transition to the feedlot and limiting loss in value due to illness and decreased performance. The objective of this study was to rapidly replenish water and key nutrients in newly received feedlot calves by assessing water intake (WI) and providing a supplemental water source or a nutritional rehydration solution during the first three days after arrival. Crossbred heifers [n= 270; initial BW = 232 ± 16 kg] were individually weighed after 11 h transportation and sorted into 18 pens (6 pens/treatment). Treatments were: 1) Control (CON): standard in-pen automatic water source (Richie CM480; one waterer/pen); 2) Supplemental water source (SWS): CON + one additional stock tank/pen; and 3) Nutritional rehydration solution (NRS): trace-mineral based drinking solution provided with one stock tank/pen. Treatments were provided from days 1 to 4, after which supplemental tanks were removed. From days 5 to 56, cattle only had access to CON (automatic waterer). Water intake was measured daily throughout the trial, BW and whole blood (5 heifers/pen) were collected on days 1, 4, 14, 28, and 56. Treatment × experimental period interactions (P ≤ 0.03) were observed for WI, dry matter intake (DMI), average daily gain (ADG). The DMI was greater for both SWS and NRS than CON from days 5 to 15 (P ≤ 0.01), and SWS had greater DMI than CON from days 16 to 29 (P = 0.01). Both SWS and NRS had greater WI than CON from days 1 to 4 (P ≤ 0.001), but not from days 5 to 56 (P ≥ 0.36). The ADG was less for NRS than CON from days 1 to 4 (P = 0.01); however, treatments did not affect ADG from days 5 to 56 (P ≥ 0.12). No treatment or treatment × day or experimental period effects (P ≥ 0.061) were observed for BW and gain:feed (G:F). Treatments did not affect morbidity and mortality (P ≥ 0.20). No treatment effect or treatment × day interactions were observed for plasma glucose, non-esterified fatty acids, total red or white blood cell counts (P ≥ 0.23). Hematocrit and hemoglobin decreased for SWS and NRS when compared with CON (P ≤0.05). Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) antibodies increased for NRS when compared with SWS and CON (P = 0.004). The results suggest that providing SWS or NRS to newly received calves during the initial three days after arrival increases WI, DMI, antibodies against respiratory viruses, hydration, but has little impact on performance, blood metabolites, and immune cells.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/101/Supplement_3/81/52957101/skad281.098.pdf",""

Animal advocates will worry that the hybrid approach marks animals as fundamentally different from human beings, while advocates for gender justice will worry that preserving gendered pronouns for animals will also preserve gender essentialism. However, switching to a universal default singular they—that is, where we use “they” for all individuals, both human and nonhuman—may set back animals’ interest in being seen as sentient individuals.

We investigated the impacts of heat and drought stress on transcriptomic and metabolic responses of berries from two wine grape varieties. Cabernet Sauvignon and Riesling grapevines were subjected to one of four treatments during early fruit ripening: 1) drought stress only, 2) heat stress only, 3) simultaneous drought and heat stress, 4) no drought or heat stress (control). Berry metabolites, especially organic acids, were analyzed, and time-course transcriptome analysis was performed on samples before, during, and after the stress episode. Both alone and in conjunction with water stress, heat stress had a much more significant impact on berry organic acid content, pH, and titratable acidity than water stress. This observation contrasts with previous reports for leaves, which responded more strongly to water stress, indicating that grape berries display a distinct, organ-specific response to environmental stresses. Consistent with the metabolic changes, the global transcriptomic analysis revealed that heat stress had a more significant impact on gene expression in grape berries than water stress in both varieties. The differentially expressed genes were those associated with the tricarboxylic acid cycle and glyoxylate cycle, mitochondrial electron transport and alternative respiration, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, carbohydrate allocation, ascorbate metabolism, and abiotic stress signaling pathways. Knowledge regarding how environmental stresses, alone and in combination, impact the berry metabolism of different grape varieties will form the basis for developing recommendations for climate change mitigation strategies and genetic improvement.","https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2500367/v1",""

These impacts may vary spatially, depending on habitat quality. We developed a Bayesian hierarchical model to investigate the effects of seasonal weather patterns on brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) populations occupying suitable and marginal habitats separated by the Eastern Continental Divide in North Carolina, USA. We specified weather-related coefficients separately for the Interior and Atlantic slope populations. We also specified multi-scale random effects to account for heterogeneity due to nested stream habitats. Our cohesive framework accommodates depletion sampling data and allows us to infer variation in capture probabilities between two different sampling protocols. As expected, we found the Atlantic slope (i.e., marginal habitats) population sizes were smaller on average than those of the Interior (i.e., suitable habitats), and the dominant drivers differed for either side of the Divide. Specifically, juvenile fish on the Atlantic slope were most adversely affected by high winter flows, and the Interior juveniles were most adversely affected by high spring flows. We also identified higher spatial variation than temporal variation in trout density conditioned on the covariates, where the primary source of spatial heterogeneity was likely meso-habitat characteristics of stream segments. Our method allowed us to partition uncertainty between population dynamics and imperfect detection, and facilitated scale-specific inference useful to develop management strategies for a species of conservation concern. This approach is widely applicable to other lotic species and ecosystems occupying dendritic habitats.","",""

Patients in the 41–55 age groups had the highest prevalence and Hispanic and Asian patients were three times more likely to be represented than white and black patient populations. Conclusion:: Asian and Hispanic race and a 41–55 year age group are correlated with a significantly greater prevalence of melasma. The prevalence rate for melasma in this database may be far lower than prior reported rates due to incorrect or missed coding within this database, which is billing code dependent.","https://journals.lww.com/10.4103/jdds.jdds_44_23",""

Addressing this query, we integrate insights related to star performers’ experiences of cumulative advantage and disproportionate bargaining power with insights from the careers literature to develop theory related to stars’ direct and indirect value creation and value capture as they age. Specifically, we first develop arguments that stars, as a function of their disproportionate status and bargaining power, will enjoy higher pay relative to individual performance (PRIP) in comparison to their non-star peers. Second, we argue that this difference in PRIP will be greater among older employees, as stars’ cumulative advantage is a progressive phenomenon that continues to widen the initial gaps in their PRIP relative to others over their careers. Next, countering the apparent implication that the value proposition associated with employing stars deteriorates as stars age, we find that the magnitude of stars’ indirect contributions through positive spillovers to their peers’ performance increases with age. Lastly, we account for some of the mechanisms through which older stars have a more positive impact on their peers.

In this basic model, we show that the non-cooperative equilibrium is not Pareto efficient by introducing a compensation mechanism and showing that a Pareto improving trade could be made. We then show that if a wage increase for one player leads to a reduction in social connections, under some circumstances a mutually beneficial agreement could be reached in which the player foregoes the wage increase in exchange for a cash transfer.

The model reconciles the conflicting insights of dynamic systems models of human population change, and we conduct a preliminary test of this model’s implications in Central Texas by developing time-series that estimate changes in human population density, modeled ecosystem productivity, human diet, and labor over the last 12,500 years. Our analysis indicates that Texas hunter-gatherers experienced three long-term population growth overshoots and recessions into quasi equilibria. Evidence indicates that each of these overshoots and recessions associate with changes in diet and labor devoted to processing high density, lower quality resources to unlock calories and nutrients. Over the long-term, population recessions may be necessary for populations to experiment with social and physical infrastructure changes that raise the carrying capacity of their environment.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/09596836231183072",""

We develop a mathematical model of a user forum's operations to obtain a “white box” view of a user forum and reveal the support system's dynamics.

However, personality factors, including having an internal locus of control (LOC) or a conscientious personality, relate to resilience and effective stress coping. We explore whether personality factors convey resilience against the negative effects of ELD on cognition, by gender, in Mexico. Methods: Using the 2015 Mexican Health and Aging Study, we estimated expected cognition using multiple ELD markers to identify a subsample in the lowest quartile of expected cognition given ELD (n = 2,086). In this subsample, we estimated cross-sectional associations between personality and having above-median observed cognitive ability (n = 522) using logistic regression. Results: Among those in the lowest quartile of expected cognition, a more internal LOC (β = 0.32 [men] and β = 0.44 [women]) and conscientious personality (β = 0.39 [men] and β = 0.17 [women]) were significantly associated with having above-median cognitive ability in models adjusted for demographic confounders. Larger benefits of conscientiousness were observed for men than women. Associations between personality and having above-median cognitive ability remained statistically significant after further adjustment for health, stress, and cognitive stimulation variables, regardless of gender. Discussion: Personality factors may convey resilience among individuals who experienced ELD, potentially breaking the link between ELD and worse late-life cognition.

Methods: QR codes were randomly distributed to students, linking them to an online quantitative survey. The survey measured sociodemographic variables, food security (current and childhood), diet, mental distress, and sleep quality. A total of Results: The findings revealed that psychological distress was the primary factor influencing sleep health ( = 1.51, Conclusion: This study demonstrates that potential linkages exist between childhood food insecurity, poor sleep, and greater psychological distress. While acknowledging the contribution of other factors, the study highlights the importance of addressing food insecurity in relation to sleep health, considering the significant impact of sleep to overall health and wellbeing.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ajhb.24032",""

The Section meeting includes scientific presentations, academic quadrathlon, undergraduate and graduate student competitions, symposia, and networking opportunities for its members. The Section has used strategic collaborations to foster multi-state projects and initiatives. One of the key discipline focus areas of the Section is forage-based beef production systems. The Section holds two symposia focused on research, Extension, and industry topics related to beef cattle management. The Bill E. Kunkle Interdisciplinary Symposium was started in 2014 to honor the impact of Dr. Kunkle, University of Florida, and fosters multi-disciplinary communication of beef cattle science. The SERA 41 Symposium is part of the regional NIMSS project focus-group on improving production efficiency of the beef cow herd in the Southeast US. The NIMSS group works collectively to create partnerships and common goal-oriented projects across the Southern Section states. The section is also home to the Randel Physiology Lecture series which was formed in 2016 to highlight Dr. Ron Randel’s commitment to the Southern Section physiology section, and to promote high-quality science for the next generation of physiologists and endocrinologists. More than 25 peer-reviewed publications and several webinars have resulted from these symposia and invited lectureships. This creates a referenceable resource for scientists on emerging topics and identifies potential priority areas of focus for scientists within the Southern region. Another highlight of the Section is the collaborative work of the Extension committee. The Extension committee collaboratively fosters Extension program development across the Southern region. The committee developed a regional webinar series in 2015 for regional training of Extension agents on livestock and forage management topics. Subsequent in-service training courses have emerged through both virtual and in-person delivery. Training is primarily focused on forage-based livestock management systems. Through these opportunities, the Southern Section has remained a gathering point for professional engagement and should continue to evolve to meet the needs of animal scientists.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/101/Supplement_3/152/52957539/skad281.187.pdf",""

While there is much emphasis on “green transportation,” a troubling fact emerges in the U.S.A.: pedestrian deaths are increasing significantly in comparison to motorist deaths, reaching nearly 6941 in 2020—the highest in over two decades. The Pedestrian and Bicycle Crash Analysis Tool was developed to determine motorists and non-motorists’ actions before a crash to accurately define the sequence of events and precipitating actions leading to traffic crashes between motor vehicles and pedestrians or bicyclists. Police report traffic crash data and crash narrative reports undoubtedly play a major role in decision-making for the safety engineers. Using crash data from three major cities in Texas (2018–2020), this study assessed the data quality of text narratives in police reports of pedestrian crashes. The objective of this study was to develop a framework for applying advanced language models to classify pedestrian maneuver types from unstructured textual content. The results show that although natural language processing models are promising as crash typing tools, narration inconsistency, data imbalance, and small sample sizes are holding back progress in this area. The framework demonstrated high accuracy for the binary classification task, but it was inconsistent for the more complex multiclass task. This framework provides the basis for applying advanced language models such as the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers model in identifying pedestrian maneuver types associated with pedestrian crashes.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/03611981231155187",""

Acinetobacter baumannii have also rapidly acquired carbapenem resistance. Here we determined the prevalence of microbicide resistance genes in carbapenem susceptible and resistant clinical isolates of Acinetobacter. Methods: All clinical isolates were collected from two separate hospitals in Detroit between 2017-2021. Following DNA isolation using Qiagen kit, Nextera Flex kit was used for library preparation of Acinetobacter clinical isolates. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed via Illumina NextSeq 550 using the prepared DNA library. The FASTQ files from the sequencing run were then subjected to bioinformatic analysis with Bionumerics software v7.6. ResFinder was used for determination of presence or absence of QAC resistant genes and results were tabulated by Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAb) or Carbapenem-Susceptible Acinetobacter baumannii (CSAb) with or without the QAC resistant genes. Results: Out of the 139 Acinetobacter patient isolates, 70/139 (50.4%) were CRAb containing carbapenemase blaOXA-23 and 69/139 (49.6%) belonged to CSAb (Table 1). Figure 1. shows the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes in CRAb and CSAb isolates with qacE genes. For CRAb isolates, 56% had qacE genes while 39% of CSAb had qacE genes. About 42% of CRAb isolates were multi-drug resistant (MDR), indicating a prevalence of qacE genes among the MDR isolates. Table 2 shows the presence of qacE genes by sequence type (ST). In the ST2 (Pasteur) and ST406 (Pasteur) strains, qacE gene was mainly present. Interestingly, most of the Acinetobacter isolates that belong to ST2 (ST195 and ST281, Oxford) are CRAb with qacE gene.Figure 1:Different AMR genes and qacE in both CRAb and CSAb isolates Conclusion: Clinical isolates in our study had an even distribution of both CRAb and CSAb. The presence of qacE gene was more prevalent in the CRAb isolates compared to the CSAb isolates. While different STs harbored the qacE gene, the prevalence of qacE gene was highest in ST2 among all isolates.

Fusarium solani species complex fungal DNA was identified in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) by polymerase chain reaction and next-generation metagenomic sequencing; a highly resistant strain was isolated from a single tissue culture. We describe epidemiology, demographics, and clinical features to inform prevention messaging, guidance, and future responses. Methods: Public health officials collected data on confirmed and probable cases (1/1/23–7/25/2023) using a standardized case report form; data were analyzed in Microsoft Excel. Results: In total, 10 probable (1 death) and 10 confirmed (8 deaths) US fungal meningitis cases were identified; all involved epidural anesthesia from the same anesthesiologist at both clinics. Most cases (80%) occurred in Texas residents. Median patient age was 31 years (range: 23–52); 19 patients were women; 13 were Hispanic/Latino. None had underlying conditions reported. At least 4 patients were uninsured, with several reporting associated care-seeking delays. Common symptoms were headache (n=18), nausea (n=13), fever (n=12), and stiff neck (n=12). Median (IQR) initial CSF results were white blood cell count (498/µL [343–825]), glucose (31 mg/dL [26–40]), and protein (99 mg/dL [52–2140]). In 8 patients, CSF (1,3)-β-D-Glucan was ≥ 500 pg/ml. From procedure date, average days (range) to symptom onset was 19 (0–58), to hospitalization was 52 (14–106). Conclusion: In the US, the fungal meningitis outbreak has primarily affected young, healthy Hispanic/Latino women travelling to Matamoros, Mexico, for procedures and resulted in a high mortality rate (40%). CDC advises US residents against having elective procedures in Matamoros involving epidural anesthetic injection. Insurance barriers may have led to medical tourism to Mexico and subsequent delayed treatment for fungal meningitis, highlighting the need for preparation to address healthcare access disparities in future outbreaks.

Both Superpave and multiple stress creep recovery (MSCR) tests were conducted to determine the optimal particle size. Three sizes of crumb-rubber particles (≤0.5 mm, ≤1 mm, and 1–2 mm) were individually incorporated into the binder at a weight proportion of 10%. The findings revealed that an increase in particle size resulted in higher viscosity, which reduced workability. However, the use of particles with a size of ≤0.5 mm effectively decreased viscosity. Furthermore, larger particle sizes enhanced resistance to rutting and improved the lifespan of the pavement. Multiple shear creep recovery (MSCR) tests confirmed that larger crumb-rubber particles exhibited a higher load-bearing capacity. Additionally, phase separation studies demonstrated that larger particle sizes were associated with increased phase separation. Notably, particles with a size of ≤0.5 mm performed exceptionally well in reducing phase separation across all combinations. In conclusion, crumb-rubber particles with a size of ≤0.5 mm were identified as the most effective in minimizing phase separation when blended with virgin asphalt binder. These findings provide solid scientific evidence related to the effects of crumb-rubber particles on the storage stability of rubberized asphalt binder and have significant implications for future research in this field.","https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/18/13568/pdf",""

Using data from a sample of incarcerated men in Arizona prisons ( N = 251), this article extends prior work by operationalizing the concept of the racial code, assessing its dimensionality, distinguishing it from the prison code, and differentiating how features of prison social organization influence racial code adherence and mobilization.

Therefore, this study conveys the laboratory evaluation of the high-temperature properties of 12 recycled polymer-modified asphalt (PMA) binders as basic research. The data evaluation was carried out using crumb rubber modifier (CRM), styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS), and styrene-isoprene-styrene (SIS) modified binders, depending on their recycled binders. To assess the properties of each binder, the viscosity and viscoelasticity were measured. Overall, the results of this study revealed that (1) an increasing trend for the viscosity of all asphalt binders was seen as the recycled binder was added and showed their characteristics depending on modifiers; (2) the tendency for using each modified binder in the original and rolling thin-film oven (RTFO) condition appeared for modifiers to have their properties when reusing them; (3) from the Jnr and %rec values, each property of modifiers kept its inherent characteristics, but a potential limit was seen in that a styrene block copolymer was mainly effective on this test method. To sum up, modifiers in asphalt mixture can have their unique properties even after reusing them in recycled asphalt mixture. Therefore, it is recommended that modifiers in asphalt mixture are considered as a potential factor in utilizing reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP).","https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/17/12744/pdf",""

This study aims to assess the ability of analysis by REIMS coupled with chemometric modeling to predict the quality attributes of wet-aged beef at the grading time. USDA Select and upper two-thirds Choice (n=42, N=84) striploins (longissimus lumborum [LL]) and tenderloins (psoas major [PM]) were collected 36 h postmortem from a commercial beef abattoir. The LL and PM were cut into portions and aged for 3, 14, and 28 d. Aged samples were analyzed for slice shear force,Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBS), and trained sensory panels (tenderness, juiciness, and flavor attributes), and results were used to categorize both LL and PM into binary classes. Additionally, slivers of the longissimus dorsi muscle between the 12th and 13th rib were collected during grading (36 h postmortem) and analyzed using REIMS. The REIMS data were used to build predictive models for tenderness, juiciness, and flavor classes for the 3 aging periods and 2 muscles. Prediction accuracies of all models were higher than classifying the samples by chance (P&lt;0.05), except WBS of 3 d aging model (P&gt;0.05). However, model accuracies were not too high, which could be due to overlaps between classes, small sample sizes, and unbalanced data, which could negatively affect predictive models. Results demonstrated that the chemical finger-prints obtained with REIMS could potentially sort carcasses by flavor, juiciness, and tenderness in real time. However, the full realization of this approach will require an increased sample size and the development of a sampling method that allows improved separation between sensory classes.","https://www.iastatedigitalpress.com/mmb/article/16120/galley/15256/download/",""

We used data from the Mexican Health and Aging Study (2015-2018). We included participants who reported frequent pain at both waves (n=2,211). LOC and conscientiousness were measured continuously, with higher values indicating a more internal LOC or conscientious personality. We incorporated depressive symptoms from both waves to create a 4-level depressive symptoms variable: stable low/ no depression (&lt; 5/&lt; 5), recently remitted (5+/&lt; 5), recent onset (&lt; 5/5+), and stable high (5+/5+). We used multinomial logistic regression models to assess the association between personality and depressive symptoms, adjusting for sociodemographic variables. At baseline, participants (73.2% women) were on average 67.6 years old. A more internal LOC was associated with a lower risk of stable high depressive symptoms compared to those with stable low/no depression symptoms [Relative Risk Ratio: 0.82, 95% confidence interval: 0.72, 0.92). Both personality factors were not associated with recently remitted or recent onset depressive symptoms.

Interventions on orienting individuals to a higher internal LOC may be helpful in pain management by mitigating comorbid depressive symptoms.","https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/7/Supplement_1/842/54743750/igad104.2717.pdf",""

The ‘self-acting’ (cis) model posits that the nucleotide (GTP or GDP) bound to a particular tubulin dictates how strongly that tubulin interacts, whereas the ‘interface-acting’ (trans) model posits that the nucleotide at the interface of two tubulin dimers is the determinant. We identified a testable difference between these mechanisms using mixed nucleotide simulations of microtubule elongation: with self-acting nucleotide plus- and minus-end growth rates decreased in the same proportion to the amount of GDP-tubulin, whereas with interface-acting nucleotide plus-end growth rates decreased disproportionately. We then experimentally measured plus- and minus-end elongation rates in mixed nucleotides and observed a disproportionate effect of GDP-tubulin on plus-end growth rates. Simulations of microtubule growth were consistent with GDP-tubulin binding at and ‘poisoning’ plus-ends but not at minus-ends. Quantitative agreement between simulations and experiments required nucleotide exchange at terminal plus-end subunits to mitigate the poisoning effect of GDP-tubulin there.

Boys toiled in print shops and girls spent their days sewing. In its first decades, the Republic prioritized protecting these youngsters. Motivated by new ideas about childhood, lawmakers expanded access to education, regulated child labor, and developed child welfare. These policies defined childhood as a distinct, standardized stage of life. Legislators and reformers established institutions, such as vocational schools and juvenile courts, to promote children’s development. However, in 1940 at the Republic’s close, the average working-class child entered the workforce in his or her teen-aged years. As An Age to Work demonstrates, the Republic’s enactment and enforcement of age-based regulations reinforced class- and gender-based divisions in the experience of childhood. Through regulating age, legislators encoded a specific path to adulthood for working-class children, one that led to the workforce. The agents of the republican welfare state, such as social workers or labor inspectors, protected young people while policing their productivity. The regulation of childhood too affirmed the separation between girls and boys, as girls’ work tended to slip outside the purview of the state. An Age to Work enters into the streets and apartments of working-class Paris to examine how the laboring classes envisioned childhood. For working-class parents, childhood was more fluid. But while they resisted the government’s efforts to standardize childhood, they too used the Republic’s welfare institutions to direct their offspring to the workforce.","",""

Situating the USSR’s involvement in UNESCO in longer Soviet and Russian internationalist traditions, it tells the story of how the country went from boycotting UNESCO under Josef Stalin to embracing the organization in the years after his death. By doing so, it demonstrates that the Soviet decision to join UNESCO and other noncommunist international organizations in the post-Stalin period amounted to a recognition of the UN system as the legitimate venue for world governance. A result of the converging premises of the UN and the USSR as enlightenment projects for a better world, this endorsement of the UN made the world body a staple in the Soviet internationalist repertoire, enabling Soviet citizens to experiment with utopian visions of world governance, world civic duty, and international community. Soviet white-collar professionals worked for world governance as international civil servants in the UNESCO Secretariat. Members of the Soviet intelligentsia contributed to the international communities made by UNESCO gatherings and collaborative projects. Last, Soviet readers joined international reading publics engendered by UN print culture, creatively engaging with UN ideas as a result. Taken together, these Soviet citizens of the world used the UN to strive for a better future, practicing the dream of one world amid the realities of the Cold War.","",""

It has been previously detected in cattle herds across the world, including United States beef herd. Mode of transmission, prevalence, and a full profile of symptoms associated with this species of bacteria have not been established. This case study aimed to elucidate the percentage of infected cattle in a local Erath County beef herd and determine which groups of cattle may have the greatest infection rates. Groups were determined based on sex and age, bull, cow, or unsexed calf. Blood was collected from 4 bulls, 61 cows, and 55 calves from the same producer on the same day. A blood extraction kit that utilized spin column-based nucleic acid purification was used to extract DNA from blood samples. Primers were constructed to be highly specific to the m. wenyonii sequence to avoid confusion with other common mycoplasma species. Extracted m. weyonii DNA was quantified using qPCR. Melt curve analysis was performed to verify the amplicon product size. Standard deviation of the melting point was calculated and selection was made within 2 standard deviations of the control. Animals with any detectable amount of m. wenyonii DNA present in their blood were considered positive for infection for the purposes of this case study. This survey yielded positive results for 2 of the 4 bulls, 19 of the 61 cows, and 0 calves. The lack of positive samples in the calf population suggests that the placenta functions as a barrier to infection. This study provides perspective on the prevalence of this microorganism in Texas cattle populations and serves as a basis for future studies. More investigation is needed to better understand the impact of this bacterial infection on Texas beef cattle producers.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/101/Supplement_1/118/50196214/skad068.141.pdf",""

Oral health was measured by self-reported physician-diagnosed oral health problems including presence of painful teeth, ulcers for more than two weeks, bleeding gums, swelling gums, loose teeth, dental cavities or caries, soreness or cracks in the corners of the mouth, or other problems as well as edentulism (i.e., losing all natural teeth, some natural teeth, or no teeth). A higher number of these problems indicated a more complex oral health condition. Cognitive function was measured by the standardized total score of all cognitive tests in the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP). Binomial logistic regression models were used to analyze the relationship between the diagnosis of oral health problems and cognitive function. Results showed that having one or more oral health problems was associated with lower scores on cognitive function (β=-0.16, p=0.04), after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and health status. There was no significant association between edentulism and cognitive function.

We report the case of a 36-year-old woman who presented with substernal, pressure-like chest pain without aggravating, alleviating, or associated symptoms. Initial evaluation revealed elevated troponin levels which peaked at 8.71 ng/mL. Electrocardiogram showed borderline J point elevation in the lateral leads. A transthoracic echocardiography revealed mild left ventricular dysfunction with an estimated ejection fraction of 45% to 50%, an akinetic apex with hyperdynamic basal segments, suggestive of stress cardiomyopathy. However, a left anterior descending artery (LAD) infarction could not be excluded. Emergent coronary angiography revealed SCAD of the LAD. No coronary interventions were performed. The patient was managed medically with dual antiplatelet therapy and beta-blockers. Given the high suspicion for fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), computed tomographic angiography (CTA) of the head to pelvis was performed. The CTA neck showed bilateral focal areas of mild stenosis and dilation of the distal cervical internal carotid artery, and CTA abdomen revealed multiple splenic artery aneurysms, diagnostic of FMD.

Nationwide, Pediatric ASPs have shown a very rapid growth during the past decade. Inpatient stewardship can present some challenges, particularly with special patient populations like newborns and premature infants. Methods: A new Pediatric Antimicrobial Stewardship committee was established in April 2022 at Ochsner LSU Health Shreveport- St. Mary’s Hospital. The first process measurement was a medication usage evaluation (MUE) report of piperacillin-tazobactam from January 31st, 2020, to September 7th, 2021, in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) for early and late onset sepsis. Neonatologists received education about the recommended antibiotics for these indications. The stewardship committee obtained a report one year later to evaluate the impact of the intervention. Slicer dicer, a data extraction tool from EPIC Electronic Health Record (EHR) system was used to determine how many NICU patients received piperacillin-tazobactam. Results: From January 31st, 2020, to September 7th, 2021, the charts of 64 neonatal patients, who were prescribed piperacillin-tazobactam, were reviewed. Out of these 64 patients, 46 (72%) were 4-28 days old when the antibiotic was received, 33 (72%) received piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin and 13 received additional antibiotics. Indications for the 46 patients included: Possible sepsis (15%), confirmed sepsis (6.5%), possible necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) (2.2%) and confirmed NEC (10.9%). The report demonstrated a possible overuse of piperacillin-tazobactam for early and late onset sepsis, without the diagnosis of NEC. We reported this antibiotic’s usage in NICU patients during the years 2020, 2021 and 2022 (Figure 1).Figure 1:Piperacillin-tazobactam usage in newborns and infants admitted to the Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Conclusion: Neonates and premature infants can represent a challenging patient population for Pediatric ASPs’ interventions. Before the introduction of this committee, there was no tracking of the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in patients admitted to the NICU.

Additionally, we examine whether prison misconduct is influenced by military service history and the receipt of substance abuse treatment. Controlling for a host of relevant variables, our results indicate that traumatic events show a significant effect on psychological adjustment only indirectly through veterans who developed post-traumatic stress disorder and that misconduct is lower among those who received an honorable discharge.

The primary goal of this study was to test reproducibility and robustness of a renal proximal tubule microphysiological system, OrganoPlate 3-lane 40, as an in vitro model for drug transport and toxicity studies. This microfluidic model was compared with static multiwell cultures and tested using several human renal proximal tubule epithelial cell (RPTEC) types. The model was characterized in terms of the functional transport for various tubule-specific proteins, epithelial permeability of small molecules (cisplatin, tenofovir, and perfluorooctanoic acid) versus large molecules (fluorescent dextrans, 60–150 kDa), and gene expression response to a nephrotoxic xenobiotic. The advantages offered by OrganoPlate 3-lane 40 as compared with multiwell cultures are the presence of media flow, albeit intermittent, and increased throughput compared with other microfluidic models. However, OrganoPlate 3-lane 40 model appeared to offer only limited (eg, MRP-mediated transport) advantages in terms of either gene expression or functional transport when compared with the multiwell plate culture conditions. Although OrganoPlate 3-lane 40 can be used to study cellular uptake and direct toxic effects of small molecules, it may have limited utility for drug transport studies. Overall, this study offers refined experimental protocols and comprehensive comparative data on the function of RPETCs in traditional multiwell culture and microfluidic OrganoPlate 3-lane 40, information that will be invaluable for the prospective end-users of in vitro models of the human proximal tubule.","https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/toxsci/kfad080/51238704/kfad080.pdf",""

Boys toiled in print shops and girls spent their days sewing. In its first decades, the Republic prioritized protecting these youngsters. Motivated by new ideas about childhood, lawmakers expanded access to education, regulated child labor, and developed child welfare. These policies defined childhood as a distinct, standardized stage of life. Legislators and reformers established institutions, such as vocational schools and juvenile courts, to promote children’s development. However, in 1940 at the Republic’s close, the average working-class child entered the workforce in his or her teen-aged years. As An Age to Work demonstrates, the Republic’s enactment and enforcement of age-based regulations reinforced class- and gender-based divisions in the experience of childhood. Through regulating age, legislators encoded a specific path to adulthood for working-class children, one that led to the workforce. The agents of the republican welfare state, such as social workers or labor inspectors, protected young people while policing their productivity. The regulation of childhood too affirmed the separation between girls and boys, as girls’ work tended to slip outside the purview of the state. An Age to Work enters into the streets and apartments of working-class Paris to examine how the laboring classes envisioned childhood. For working-class parents, childhood was more fluid. But while they resisted the government’s efforts to standardize childhood, they too used the Republic’s welfare institutions to direct their offspring to the workforce.","",""

We suggest that there are major gaps linking animal physiology and behavior in noise to fitness; that there is a limited understanding of variation in hearing within and across species, especially in the context of real-world acoustic conditions; and that many puzzling responses to noise could be clarified with a community-level lens that considers indirect effects.

Nucleic acid-based analysis of the purulent material of LA has indicated that Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla, next to phylum Fusobacteria. The sporadic isolations of bacterial species of the Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes in LA have been reported. An aspect of the pathogenesis that has not been investigated is whether bacterial pathogens in LA originate, besides the rumen, from the colon? Therefore, our objectives were to target detection and isolations of Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacteroides fragilis, in addition to routine isolations of F. necrophorum and T. pyogenes, from LA and also from ruminal and colonic epithelial tissues of the same animals. Liver abscesses, matched with ruminal and colonic epithelial tissue samples from 96 steers and heifers, originating from 15 feedlots, were collected at slaughter, transported to the laboratory and processed within 24 hours. Samples were subjected to anaerobic and aerobic culture methods, including enrichment and selective media for detection and isolation of S. enterica, E. coli, K. pneumonia, P. aeruginosa, and B. fragilis. Prevalence of bacterial species were shown in table 1. For each bacterium, two-sided Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate the association of its prevalence in LA with that in colon and rumen at 0.05 level. Overall, prevalence of subsp. necrophorum, subsp. funduliforme, T. pyogenes and S. enterica in liver abscesses were 86.4% (83/96), 21.8% (21/96), 35.4% (34/96) and 6.2% (6/96), respectively (Table 1). In ruminal tissue samples, prevalence of subsp. necrophorum, subsp. funduliforme, T. pyogenes and S. enterica were 6.6% (6/96), 40.6% (39/96), 11.4% (11/96) and 4.1% (4/96), respectively.

The Model of Developmental Adaptation led to a path analysis with positive valuation of life or the developmental outcome regressed on proximal influences assessed by mediating variables, social provisions, and forgiveness, and these on the distal predictor, adverse childhood experiences.

The STI has often been applied to individual speech articulators, but an STI derived from the acoustic signal offers a composite and easily obtained measure that incorporates multiple components of the speech production complex. In this work, we examine the relationship between kinematic and acoustic STIs in children with and without developmental language disorder (DLD), with the aim of determining whether the acoustic and kinematic STIs reflect similar degrees of production variability. Method:: A total of 85 children with DLD and with typical language development (or typically developing [TD] children), aged 4–8 years, were studied. In this methodological article, two experiments were conducted: one deliberately selected because group differences were observed in the kinematic STI (i.e., sentence production) and one in which there were no group differences in the kinematic STI (i.e., nonword production). These two experiments are representative of speech stability studies. The aim was to determine whether the acoustic STI (i.e., amplitude envelope) results aligned with those obtained via the kinematic STI (i.e., lip motion). Results:: In sentence production, most group differences aligned across kinematic and acoustic STI measures. The acoustic, but not the kinematic, STI showed higher variability in children with DLD compared with the 6-year-old TD group. In nonword production, neither the kinematic STI nor the acoustic STI differentiated children with DLD from TD children. In each experiment, the kinematic and acoustic STIs showed a moderate-to-strong correlation. Conclusions:: The kinematic and acoustic STIs assess different components of speech movement patterning. However, the relationship between acoustic and kinematic spatiotemporal stability is strong in two tasks of varying linguistic complexity in children with and without DLD. These findings are promising for future experimental work in this area.","http://pubs.asha.org/doi/pdf/10.1044/2022_JSLHR-22-00290",""

Understanding their elastic and anisotropic properties plays a significant role in geophysical modeling and imaging, reservoir geomechanics, and reservoir characterization. One can obtain their velocity anisotropy through laboratory and field measurements or rock-physics models. However, the measurements are scarce, and theoretical modeling of Thomsen’s anisotropy parameters generally requires extra inputs, which are sometimes difficult to obtain. We have compiled ultrasonic data from 159 self-sourced reservoir shale samples from the literature and our own measurements. Simple exponential models can capture the trends of the P- and S-wave anisotropy parameters [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] decreasing with the increasing vertical P- and S-wave velocities, with [Formula: see text] being above 0.84. The error in estimated anisotropy is small for high-velocity ([Formula: see text]) shales but relatively large for low-velocity ([Formula: see text]) shales. We analyze the influence of multiple geologic factors on the proposed anisotropy-velocity relationships. We observe that velocity anisotropy generally increases with clay content. In addition, mature shales (0.6 < Ro (%) < 1.4) generally have stronger anisotropy strength spreading in a broader range than overmature shales (Ro (%) > 1.4). Overall, no single parameter dominates the source of velocity anisotropy, which is jointly affected by the coupled factors of clay content, organic matter, porosity, maturity level, and geologic history. The empirical model has the potential to offer a fast and straightforward method of predicting P- and S-wave anisotropy strength from vertical P- and S-wave velocities.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/geo2022-0543.1",""

National engineering programs have placed a high priority on broadening participation in engineering and making the engineering culture more inclusive. Specifically, the cultivation of engineering students' inclusive professional engineering identities (IPEIs)—or the value these individuals place on diversity and their willingness to act inclusively within engineering contexts—might be one way to address this long‐standing lack of representation. Purpose: Rooted in theoretical contexts regarding professional identity development, the purpose of this study is to uncover developmental patterns of first‐year engineering students' IPEIs and factors that influence IPEI cultivation. Methods: This study built upon the previous variable‐centered research findings regarding IPEI development. Specifically, the person‐centered approach of random intercept latent transition analysis (RI‐LTA) was utilized. RI‐LTA allows for the detection of different meaningful groups of individuals demonstrating similarities on the construct and investigating these groups for probabilistic changes over time. Results: Four IPEI groups of students emerged with IPEI developmental patterns that were not always stable. Student IPEI classifications differed significantly across gender and students' levels of engineering identity. Furthermore, a series of intervention experiences instigated an even more malleable nature to student IPEIs. Conclusions: Engineering students' IPEIs demonstrate some likelihood to change over time, with intervention experiences enhancing the likelihoods for changes to occur. Continuing to investigate factors influencing the positive cultivation of students' IPEIs is fundamental to broadening participation in engineering and making the engineering culture more inclusive.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jee.20567",""

We study three drivers of CABG readmission risk—hospital and surgeon case volume, variation in surgeon volume, and surgeon familiarity with hospitals. Drawing on unique patient data sets of CABG surgeries spanning 3 years, we study the relationships between hospital and surgeon case volume, readmission risk, and postoperative length of stay (PLOS). We find evidence of an inverted U‐shaped relationship between case volume and readmission risk and a U‐shaped relationship with PLOS. Our results also indicate that surgeon volume variation moderates the relationship between surgeon volume and readmission risk, where readmission risk increases with greater variation in surgeon volume. We observe that the impact of surgeon experience on readmission risk at the focal hospital outweighs their experience at other hospitals.

We expect investors to view small bad news guidance as less credible than small good news guidance. We find that investors respond less to small bad news guidance than to similar magnitudes of good news guidance. We show that investor skepticism is justified because small bad news guidance is generally less accurate than the prevailing consensus analyst forecast, whereas other guidance is typically more accurate than the prevailing consensus analyst forecast. Furthermore, the likelihood that bad news guidance is less accurate than the prevailing analyst forecast has increased since the mid-1990s.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-horizons/article-pdf/37/1/121/89729/i0888-7993-37-1-121.pdf",""

A crucial reason for the detection methods not being developed based on a real-life dataset is the scarcity of large-scale, real-life botnet datasets. Due to security and privacy concerns, organizations do not publish their real-life botnet dataset. Realizing the need for a real-life large-scale botnet dataset, in this paper, we develop a simulation methodology to simulate a large-scale botnet dataset from a real-life botnet dataset. This simulation methodology is based on the Markov chain and role-mining approaches. Besides simulating the degree distribution, our simulation methodology also simulates triangles (community structures). We propose a novel scalable algorithm using parallel computing that generates large-scale botnet graphs from a small-size input dataset. To evaluate the performance of our simulation methodology, we compare our simulated graph with the original graph and with the graph simulated by the Preferential attachment (PA) algorithm based on the distributions of triangles, indegrees, and outdegrees. Results demonstrate that the distributions of the simulated graph generated by our methodology are very similar to the distributions of the original graph with minor real-life random variations. Results also demonstrate that our simulation algorithm substantially outperforms the PA algorithm in simulating the distributions of triangles and botnet subgraphs. To emphasize the accuracy of botnet simulation more, we provide a separate comparison between the botnet subgraphs of the simulated and the original graphs that demonstrates the similarity of our simulated botnet subgraphs with the original botnet subgraph. A comparison of our simulated scaled-up graph with the original graph demonstrates that our methodology preserves the triangle distribution and the botnet subgraphs of the original graph, whereas the PA algorithm fails to preserve the triangle distribution and the botnet subgraphs in the scaled-up graph.</p>","https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3246819/v1",""

Built on institutional theory, we specifically examine how political distance, representing host–home country differences in various attributes in the political environment, influences the speed of approval for EMNC acquisition in the United States. The findings suggest that a larger political distance between the United States and EMNCs home country reflects challenges for EMNCs to gain legitimacy in the United States, resulting in the longer time required for acquisition approval. The EMNCs' corporate political activity moderated this relationship in that more corporate political activity improves the legitimacy perception of EMNCs among political actors, decreasing the time required for acquisition approval.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/tie.22355",""

In turn, functional limitations potentially contribute to youths' heightened experience of IBD‐induced intrusions on a wide range of routine and valued activities (i.e., illness intrusiveness), which can increase their risk for depressive symptoms. The present study examined the contributions of clinical disease activity, functional disability, and illness intrusiveness to depressive symptoms in youth with IBD. Methods: Youth ( Results: Results revealed a mediating effect for functional disability in the association between disease activity and depressive symptoms (PGA → FDI → CDI‐2); illness intrusiveness mediated the association between functional disability and depressive symptoms (i.e., FDI → IIS‐C → CDI‐2). Serial mediation revealed that clinical disease activity conferred an indirect effect on youth depressive symptoms through the sequential effects of functional disability and illness intrusiveness (i.e., PGA → FDI → IIS‐C → CDI‐2). Conclusions: Taken together, these findings indicate that youth who encounter more physical limitations as a function of clinical disease activity are more likely to experience an amplified sense of IBD‐related intrusions on their ability to participate in meaningful activities. In turn, heightened illness intrusiveness increases the likelihood of depressive symptoms. Clinical interventions that help youth maintain adequate functional ability in the face of IBD disease activity and encourage involvement in positively valued activities could decrease the negative impact of IBD on youths' emotional adjustment.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jpn3.12056",""

We argue that there are at least three factors that result in underestimation of the social and environmental impact of dust events, making them receive less attention. These include (1) sparse monitoring stations with irregular spatial distribution in dust-influenced regions, (2) inconsistency with dust sampling methods, and (3) sampling frequency and schedules, which can lead to missed dust events or underestimation of dust particle concentrations. Without addressing these three factors, it is challenging to characterize and understand the full air quality impacts of dust events in the United States.

We hypothesized that a combination of phenotypic and transcriptomic data could be integrated to make decisions as to selection of group-representative worst-case petroleum UVCBs for subsequent toxicity evaluation in vivo. We used data obtained from 141 substances from 16 manufacturing categories previously tested in 6 human cell types (induced pluripotent stem cell [iPSC]-derived hepatocytes, cardiomyocytes, neurons, and endothelial cells, and MCF7 and A375 cell lines). Benchmark doses for gene-substance combinations were calculated, and both transcriptomic and phenotype-derived points of departure (PODs) were obtained. Correlation analysis and machine learning were used to assess associations between phenotypic and transcriptional PODs and to determine the most informative cell types and assays, thus representing a cost-effective integrated testing strategy. We found that 2 cell types—iPSC-derived-hepatocytes and -cardiomyocytes—contributed the most informative and protective PODs and may be used to inform selection of representative petroleum UVCBs for further toxicity evaluation in vivo.

Subfossil specimens resembling T. macrodon from shell middens in the Trinity river drainage have raised questions about its presumptive range. Extant Truncilla populations occupying the Trinity river drainage are believed to be Truncilla donaciformis, the Fawnsfoot, but the species identity has not been assessed using molecular techniques. In this study, we set out to use phylogeographic and morphometric approaches to resolve the distribution of Truncilla spp. in Texas, with an emphasis on assessing species identity of Truncilla in the Trinity river drainage. Our molecular analyses indicated individuals from the Trinity river drainage are T. macrodon rather than T. donaciformis, and morphometric analyses using ratios of shell length, width and height supports this finding and showed differentiation among T. macrodon, Truncilla cognata and T. donaciformis. These combined findings suggest the range of T. macrodon is larger than previously recognized and includes the Colorado, Brazos and Trinity river drainages. The status of Truncilla spp. in the San Jacinto river basin remains unclear due to lack of information on historical or extant populations, but we recommend conservationists consider T. macrodon as part of the mussel fauna since the drainage shares an embayment with the Trinity river drainage. Molecular data also indicated the Trinity population of T. macrodon is distinct from, and more genetically diverse than, the Brazos and Colorado populations. This difference suggests the Trinity River population should be treated as a separate management unit from the Brazos and Colorado River populations to facilitate effective conservation and recovery planning. Our study adds to the growing body of literature highlighting the utility of molecular data in conservation and management of freshwater mussels.","https://academic.oup.com/mollus/article-pdf/89/3/eyad015/51279601/eyad015.pdf",""

After forests, grasslands are the primary carbon sink source and the most used feed source for livestock production. Regularly monitoring grasslands assures efficient management and sustainability of pasture-based production systems. Conventional ground-based methods to monitor grassland production and management rely on field measurements, which are time-consuming and usually restricted to small-scale assessment. Using satellite information allows for large-scale monitoring of grasslands and capturing the spatial variability of the land surface with high temporal resolution. Various methods for grassland monitoring based on satellite data can be applied, such as classifications, correlations/regression analyses, and time series analyses. Depending on the purpose of the application, these methods are sometimes combined to derive grassland management and production information. The ability of satellite-based data to quantify vegetation characteristics depends on the type of sensor and instrumentation features, such as spectral, radiometric, spatial, and temporal resolution, polarization, and angularity. The models to estimate grassland biomass based on remote sensing have been chiefly focused on optical systems. The spectral reflectance of raw bands and vegetation indices were used as proxies to investigate spatial and temporal patterns of grassland production. Optical (multispectral or hyperspectral) sensors are passive and require sunlight, so they depend highly on the weather (cloud) and light conditions. Thus, there has been increasing interest in active sensors, such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) sensors, which are not constrained due to clouds but are more complex. Using satellite data in combination with field measurements has commonly yielded regression models (e.g., linear, power, logarithmic, multiple linear) for estimating grassland biomass or biophysical characteristics (e.g., chlorophyll, leaf area index) of different types of grasslands. The exponential evolution of digital computers has pushed forward machine learning-based regression methods to estimate biomass. Random forest, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks are the most used algorithms. The possibility of accurate mapping and monitoring of biomass and nutritional attributes of grasslands based on satellite provides essential insights into the decision support system for pasture management. A better understanding of the nitrogen status of pastures, forage biomass, and its nutritive value is instrumental in livestock and forage management. Timely prediction of these variables can help improve decision-making by grazing land managers on, for instance, the adjustment of stocking rate or adequate supplementation to match the needs of animals toward more sustainable production. Future use of satellite-based grazing models in tandem with ruminant nutrition models will enable to development of decision-support tools to assist with many aspects of livestock production in diverse environmental conditions and accounting for temporal variability.

However, the popular DeepFake passive detection is an ex-post forensics countermeasure and fails in blocking the disinformation spread in advance. Alternatively, precautions such as adding perturbations to the real data for unnatural distorted DeepFake output easily spotted by the human eyes are introduced as proactive defenses. Recent studies suggest that these existing proactive defenses can be easily bypassed by employing simple image transformation and reconstruction techniques when applied to the perturbed real data and the distorted output, respectively. The aim of this paper is to propose a novel proactive DeepFake detection technique using GAN-based visible watermarking. To this front, we propose a reconstructive regularization added to the GAN’s loss function that embeds a unique watermark to the assigned location of the generated fake image. Thorough experiments on multiple datasets confirm the viability of the proposed approach as a proactive defense mechanism against DeepFakes from the perspective of detection by human eyes. Thus, our proposed watermark-based GANs prevent the abuse of the pretrained GANs and smartphone apps, available via online repositories, for DeepFake creation for malicious purposes. Further, the watermarked DeepFakes can also be detected by the SOTA DeepFake detectors. This is critical for applications where automatic DeepFake detectors are used for mass audits due to the huge cost associated with human observers examining a large amount of data manually.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3625547",""

The significance of these projections for corn and soybean production cannot be overestimated. This study contributes to our understanding of climate change impacts on production and farm revenues by projecting their impacts on corn and soybean yields in Buchanan County, Iowa, a county in the center of the Corn Belt. Projections indicate that as atmospheric temperatures rise and precipitation levels vary markedly, the result is a significant decline in corn and soybean yields, the latter to a lesser extent, as compared to long-term yield trends. Depending upon the climate change scenario that will materialize, corn yields are projected to decline by up to 29%, while soybean yields are projected to decline by up to 24% from their normal upward trends by the year 2100. Due to the long-term upward trends in yields, corn and soybean yields will increase in absolute terms by the end of the century. Depending upon the climate change scenario, actual corn and soybean yields will increase by 30 to 57% and 30 to 66%, respectively, by the end of the 21st century, significantly less than they would have in the absence of these climate projections.","https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/13/2/268/pdf",""

Forty‐eight‐hour continuous gastric pH monitoring was performed in all dogs.

It also suggests that the value of having a supplier on the board (SOTB) is influenced by environmental contingencies faced by a firm: operational efficiency, diversification, and demand uncertainty. Using an objective measure of supplier presence in the boardroom, the authors find that a supplier's presence enhances firm performance. They also find that the value of an SOTB in enhancing performance is greater in firms with lower operational efficiency and higher demand uncertainty and, is lower in firms with higher diversification.

To this end, solid-state micropores can measure distinct mechanical properties of diseased cells from their translocation behavior — detected as pulses in the temporal data stream of ionic current — and help diagnose diseases at early stages. However, the obstacle in such approaches is that the accuracy of the sensor is affected by noise, making the pulse detection task too subjective. This is inefficient especially when the disease-relevant data is only a fraction of the total acquired data. Thus, it is important to intelligently automate the detection process to eliminate the noise and to identify useful patterns towards error-free decision-making in real-time. This work describes a pattern detection approach based on moving-average filtering, which mitigates the impact of noise. Moreover, a detection threshold is computed from the mean and standard deviation of the data. The threshold is then used to detect different types of pulses stemming from the healthy and diseased human cells when these translocate through micropores. Extent of smoothing is an important factor for the data: greater smoothing suppresses the noise but deteriorates the pulse shape and vice versa. Additionally, the design approach computes useful features of the detected data and delivers the results for real-time analysis. This can help physicians and scientists to change their strategies of diagnosis by providing a validation of manual reviews.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2023-112170/7240351/v012t13a007-imece2023-112170.pdf",""

However, regardless of which climate scenario materializes and regardless of the baseline for comparison, soluble nitrogen losses are bound to increase, the magnitude depending upon the climate scenario. We find also that nutrient losses will be higher from continuous corn fields than from corn–soybean fields, given the tillage practices implemented on corn versus soybeans in the study area. Similarly, we find that nutrient losses may be higher from fields that receive manure than fields that receive only inorganic fertilizer, though this latter finding may be predicated upon the specific nutrient application rates utilized.","https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/13/2/470/pdf",""

The ‘self-acting’ (cis) model posits that the nucleotide (GTP or GDP) bound to a particular tubulin dictates how strongly that tubulin interacts, whereas the ‘interface-acting’ (trans) model posits that the nucleotide at the interface of two tubulin dimers is the determinant. We identified a testable difference between these mechanisms using mixed nucleotide simulations of microtubule elongation: with self-acting nucleotide, plus- and minus-end growth rates decreased in the same proportion to the amount of GDP-tubulin, whereas with interface-acting nucleotide, plus-end growth rates decreased disproportionately. We then experimentally measured plus- and minus-end elongation rates in mixed nucleotides and observed a disproportionate effect of GDP-tubulin on plus-end growth rates. Simulations of microtubule growth were consistent with GDP-tubulin binding at and ‘poisoning’ plus-ends but not at minus-ends. Quantitative agreement between simulations and experiments required nucleotide exchange at terminal plus-end subunits to mitigate the poisoning effect of GDP-tubulin there. Our results indicate that the interfacial nucleotide determines tubulin:tubulin interaction strength, thereby settling a longstanding debate over the effect of nucleotide state on microtubule dynamics.","https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/89231v2/pdf",""

This systematic literature review identified and analyzed 33 studies that explore interventions contributing to climate conflict resolution and environmental peacebuilding in receiving and migrant communities. Despite limitations of current research, the review shows that multi-scale and cross-sectoral interventions are necessary though challenging to establish. Community-level initiatives and local support networks that create social capital are key interventions leading from conflict to cooperation between climate-driven migrants and host communities. However, such interventions often require external resources that come with strings attached. Our analysis also identifies gaps in the extant literature. First, few scholars explore how adaptive capacity—especially influenced by power relations among stakeholders in newly formed communities—evolves over time in response to multiple repeated threat factors. Second, there is limited research on whether and how external interventions can help climate refugees gain access rights to natural resources for long-term conflict avoidance. Finally, there is a lack of community-based performance evaluation metrics to assess long or short-term impacts of interventions.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/27538796231207919",""

The 22-item updated Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance (uIRMA) scale is a widely used, reliable measure for assessing this construct; however, it has primarily been validated within samples of U.S. college students. To assess the factor structure and reliability of this measure for community samples of adult women, we analyzed uIRMA data from 356 U.S. women (age 25–35) collected via CloudResearch’s MTurk toolkit. Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated high internal reliability for the overall scale (α = .92) and supported a five-factor structure (subscales: She Asked For It, He Didn’t Mean To, He Didn’t Mean To [Intoxication], It Wasn’t Really Rape, She Lied) with good model fit. The rape myth ‘‘He Didn’t Mean To’’ was most highly endorsed in the overall sample, while ‘‘It Wasn’t Really Rape’’ was endorsed the least. Analyses of RMA and participant characteristics demonstrated that women identifying as politically conservative, religious (predominantly Christian), or heterosexual endorsed rape myth constructs at significantly higher rates. Education level, social media use, and victimization history yielded mixed findings across RMA subscales, while age, race/ethnicity, income level, and regional location showed no associations with RMA. Findings suggest the uIRMA is an appropriate measure of RMA in community samples of adult women; however, the field would benefit from more consistent administration of the scale (i.e., 19-item vs. 22-item version; directionality of Likert-type scale) to allow for comparability across time and samples. Rape prevention work should target ideological adherence to patriarchal and other oppressive belief systems which may represent a common underlying factor across groups of women showing higher endorsement of RMA.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/08862605231153893",""

Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) initiated Project Optimus to reform the dose optimization and dose selection paradigm in oncology drug development. To accommodate this paradigm shifting, we propose a dose-ranging approach to optimizing dose (DROID) for oncology trials with targeted drugs. DROID leverages the well-established dose-ranging study framework, which has been routinely used to develop non-oncology drugs for decades, and bridges it with established oncology dose-finding designs to optimize the dose of oncology drugs. DROID consists of two seamlessly connected stages. In the first stage, patients are sequentially enrolled and adaptively assigned to investigational doses to establish the therapeutic dose range (TDR), defined as the range of doses with acceptable toxicity and efficacy profiles, and the recommended phase 2 dose set (RP2S). In the second stage, patients are randomized to the doses in RP2S to assess the dose–response relationship and identify the optimal dose. The simulation study shows that DROID substantially outperforms the conventional approach, providing a new paradigm to efficiently optimize the dose of targeted oncology drugs. DROID aligns with the approach of a randomized, parallel dose-response trial design recommended by the FDA in the Guidance on Optimizing the Dosage of Human Prescription Drugs and Biological Products for the Treatment of Oncologic Diseases.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/biom.13840",""

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impacts of gardening and outdoor activities during the COVID-19 pandemic on perceptions of hope, hopelessness, and levels of depression, stress, and anxiety. Participants of this study were recruited through online social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram; 458 participants completed the 21-item Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale inventory as well as the Hope Scale. Our data indicated that individuals who self-reported themselves as gardeners had significantly more positive scores related to levels of stress, anxiety, and depression and a sense of hope. Furthermore, gardeners had lower levels of self-reported depression, anxiety, and stress when compared with those who did not identify themselves as gardeners. The gardeners also had a more positive outlook regarding hope for the future. Additionally, a significant positive correlation was found between the number of hours spent participating in gardening and a sense of hope, and a negative correlation was found between the number of hours gardening and stress levels. Similarly, there was a significant negative correlation between the number of hours spent participating in any outdoor activity and self-reported levels of stress, anxiety, or depression; however, there was a positive correlation between the number of hours spent participating in any outdoor activity and a sense of hope.

However, the utero-placental expression of TNSALP and the role in phosphate transport in pregnancy is poorly understood. Estrous cycles of ewes were synchronized, and ewes were euthanized and hysterectomized on Days 1, 9, or 14 of the estrous cycle or bred to fertile rams and euthanized and hysterectomized on Days 9, 12, 17, 30, 50, 70, 90, 110, or 125 of pregnancy. The expression of ALPL mRNA, immunolocalization of TNSALP protein, and quantification and localization of TNSALP enzymatic activity was performed on ovine endometria and placentomes. Day of the estrous cycle did not alter ALPL mRNA expression or enzymatic activity of TNSALP. TNSALP protein localized to uterine epithelial and stromal cells, blood vessels, myometrium, caruncular, and cotyledonary stroma. TNSALP activity was localized to uterine epithelia, blood vessels, caruncular stroma (from Day 70 of gestation), and the apical surface of chorionic epithelia (from Day 50 of gestation). TNSALP protein and activity localized to the apical surface of uterine epithelia during the estrous cycle and in early pregnancy. Endometrial TNSALP enzymatic activity was downregulated on Days 17 and 30 of gestation (P &lt; 0.05). Expression of ALPL mRNA decreased in late gestation in endometria and placentomes (P &lt; 0.05). TNSALP activity peaked in placentomes on Days 70 and 90 of gestation.

However, limited research has explored these relationships as a network, including their interconnections, and even less has done so in non‐Western populations. We employed network analysis to investigate the co‐occurrence of disordered eating symptoms, big‐five personality traits, and psychological distress in Chinese adults. Method: A sample of 500 Chinese adults (256 men) completed measures assessing big‐five personality traits, psychological distress, and disordered eating symptoms. The network of personality traits, psychological distress, and disordered eating symptoms was estimated, including its central and bridge nodes. Results: The central nodes in the network were the facets of openness ( Conclusion: Our findings suggest that personality traits (e.g., openness and extraversion) and body dissatisfaction are important in maintaining the network in a community sample of Chinese adults. While future replication is needed, findings from this study suggest that individuals with negative self‐thinking, predisposed neuroticism, and extraversion may be at risk of developing disordered eating symptoms. Public Significance: The present study contributes to existing knowledge by employing a network perspective to examine the associations between disordered eating symptoms, big‐five personality traits, and psychological distress in a Chinese adult community sample. The identified facets of neuroticism and extraversion and symptoms of psychological distress may be worthy of targeting in the prevention and treatment of disordered eating in the Chinese context.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/eat.24012",""

The central KP metabolites are neurologically active molecules or biosynthetic precursors to critical molecules, such as NAD+. Within this pathway are three enzymes of interest, HAO, ACMSD, and AMSDH, whose substrates and/or products can spontaneously cyclize to form side products such as quinolinic acid (QA or QUIN) and picolinic acid. Due to their unstable nature for spontaneous autocyclization, it might be expected that the levels of these side products would be dependent on tryptophan intake; however, this is not the case in healthy individuals. On top of that, the regulatory mechanisms of the KP remain unknown, even after a deeper understanding of the structure and mechanism of the enzymes that handle these unstable KP metabolic intermediates. Thus, the question arises, how do these enzymes compete with the autocyclization of their substrates, especially amidst increased tryptophan levels? Here, we propose the formation of a transient enzyme complex as a regulatory mechanism for metabolite distribution between enzymatic and non-enzymatic routes during periods of increased metabolic intake. Amid high levels of tryptophan, HAO, ACMSD, and AMSDH may bind together, forming a tunnel to shuttle the metabolites through each enzyme, consequently regulating the autocyclization of their products. Though further research is required to establish the formation of transient complexation as a solution to the regulatory mysteries of the KP, our docking model studies support this new hypothesis.","https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1989/13/4/500/pdf",""

Research Design and Methods: Data from 2006 to 2016 waves of the Health and Retirement Study (2006–2016) were used (N = 18,847). Outcome-wide analyses were utilized to evaluate if changes in volunteering between 2006/2008 (t0) and 2010/2012 (t1) were associated with 7 cardiovascular disease biomarkers 4 years later (2014/2016, t2). These models were adjusted for demographic factors, socioeconomic status, health behaviors, chronic conditions, baseline biomarkers, and volunteering. Additionally, selection into volunteering and attrition were taken into account. Results: Compared with nonvolunteers, volunteering more than 200 hr a year was associated with a lower risk for clinically high diastolic blood pressure. In addition, increased volunteering effort (change from 1 to 99 hr at t0 to &gt;100 hr at t1) was associated with a lower likelihood of clinically high systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels.

This study sought to explore the perceptions of certified medical interpreter dual‐role nurses and their experiences with Spanish‐speaking patients from admission to discharge in hospital stays. Design: A qualitative descriptive case study was applied in this study. Methods: Data was collected from nurses working at a United States Southwest Borderland hospital using purposive sampling and semi‐structured in‐depth interviews. A total of four dual‐role nurses participated, and thematic narrative analysis was applied. Results: Four major themes emerged. The main themes were “being a dual‐role nurse interpreter,” “patient experience,” “culture and competence, “and “nursing and caring,” With each major theme multiple sub themes emerged. Two sub themes emerged with “being a dual‐role nurse interpreter,” and two sub themes emerged with “patient experiences.” The major themes that emerged from the interviews indicated that the language barrier greatly affects Spanish‐speaking patients in their hospital stay. Participants reported having at least one encounter with a Spanish‐speaking patient that was not afforded interpretation services or had interpretation from someone other than a qualified interpreter. Patients experienced confusion, apprehension and anger associated with not being able to communicate their needs to the healthcare system. Conclusions: According to the experiences of the certified dual‐role nurse interpreters, having a language barrier makes a tremendous impact on the care of Spanish‐speaking patients. Nurse participants describe how patients and their family members experience dissatisfaction, anger and confusion when there is a language barrier and most importantly how language barriers have detrimental effects on patients with wrong medication prescriptions and wrong diagnosis. Clinical relevance: When hospital administration recognize and support nurses as certified medical interpreters as a key component for patient care when assisting persons with limited English proficiency, patients are empowered to become active members of their healthcare regimen. The role of dual‐role nurses enables brokering between the healthcare system and serves as a tool to bridge health disparities based on linguistic inequities existing in healthcare. Recruitment and retention of certified medical interpreter trained Spanish‐speaking nurses deter errors in healthcare and makes a positive impact on the healthcare regimen of Spanish‐speaking patients enabling patient empowerment through education and advocacy.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/nop2.1656",""

Few evaluate the LDI’s utility in cross-national work. This study tests metric measurement invariance of an LDI in the United States and Mexico and evaluates its validity in Mexico. Data included the United States Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP, n=3,267), MexCog (n=2,042), and a Mexican clinical validation sample with diagnosed cognitive status (51 cognitively normal, 49 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 50 dementia) who received the MexCog battery. The LDI was measured using highly comparable items (13 cognitive and 10 functional). We tested metric measurement invariance of the LDI in MexCog/HCAP samples and evaluated validity by regressing cognitive status on LDI factor scores in the Mexican validation sample using multinomial regression and evaluating how model-implied cognitive status aligned with diagnosis. Full metric invariance of the LDI in the MexCog and HCAP was supported, suggesting that the LDI may be used in cross-national work to validly compare dementia risk factors in the studies. In the Mexican validation sample, LDI factor scores significantly predicted MCI (β=-2.62, p&lt; 0.001) and dementia (β=-5.93, p&lt; 0.001) versus cognitively normal in multinomial regressions. LDI model-implied cognitive status showed moderately high dementia (84.0%) and MCI (88.9%) sensitivity and moderately high dementia (92.0%) and MCI (88.2%) specificity. The LDI may be used to cross-nationally compare risk/protective factors for dementia in MexCog/HCAP studies. Alignment between the LDI and diagnosed cognitive status in the Mexican validation sample supports its validity as a proxy for dementia in Mexico.","https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/7/Supplement_1/820/54743631/igad104.2647.pdf",""

We also show that firms with IRS audit red flags are less likely to request a PLR. We use a difference‐in‐difference approach to assess changes in cash holdings following PLR requests and report a decrease in cash holdings for PLR firms, consistent with the notion that PLRs act to reduce tax uncertainty.

While studies have attempted to understand drivers of hazard adjustments, few have focused on the overall number of adjustments undertaken instead of individual adjustments or adjustments in a multihazard environment. To address these gaps, we employ a survey sample of 866 households in Oklahoma to understand households’ danger control responses (protective hazard adjustments) for tornado and earthquake risks in Oklahoma. We apply the extended parallel processing model (EPPM) to categorize respondents according to their relative level of perceived threat and efficacy of protective actions in predicting the number of hazard adjustments they intend to or have adopted in response to tornadoes and induced earthquakes. In line with the EPPM, we found that households have the highest number of danger control responses when their perceived threat and efficacy are both high. Counter to the EPPM literature, we found low threat coupled with high efficacy moved some individuals toward the adoption of danger control responses in response to both tornadoes and earthquakes. When households have high efficacy, threat appraisals matter in tornado danger control responses but not in earthquake danger control responses. This EPPM categorization opens new research approaches for studies of natural and technological hazards. This study also provides information for local officials and emergency managers making mitigation and preparedness investments and policies.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/am-pdf/10.1111/risa.14176",""

Methods:: A PubMed search string was used to identify literature on orthopaedic surgery education from 2016 to 2021. Publications on orthopaedic surgery education were divided into 8 education-based categories: (1) operative training and simulation, (2) curriculum and career development, (3) diversity, (4) wellness and burnout, (5) program evaluation and match data, (6) trainee assessments, (7) social media, and (8) other. Univariate analysis and linear regression were used to determine trends. Results:: A total of 383 orthopaedic surgery education publications met inclusion criteria.

Among different neuroimaging modalities, prediction using functional connectivity (FC) has shown great promise. Most literature has focused on prediction using static FC, with limited investigations on the merits of such analysis compared to prediction using dynamic FC or region‐level functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) times series that encode temporal variability. To account for the temporal dynamics in fMRI, we propose a bi‐directional long short‐term memory (bi‐LSTM) approach that incorporates feature selection mechanism. The proposed pipeline is implemented via an efficient algorithm and applied for predicting intelligence using region‐level time series and dynamic FC. We compare the prediction performance using different fMRI features acquired from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study involving nearly 7000 individuals. Our detailed analysis illustrates the consistently inferior performance of static FC compared to region‐level time series or dynamic FC for single and combined rest and task fMRI experiments. The joint analysis of task and rest fMRI leads to improved intelligence prediction under all models compared to using fMRI from only one experiment. In addition, the proposed bi‐LSTM pipeline based on region‐level time series identifies several shared and differential important brain regions across fMRI experiments that drive intelligence prediction. A test–retest analysis of the selected regions shows strong reliability across cross‐validation folds. Given the large sample size of ABCD study, our results provide strong evidence that superior prediction of intelligence can be achieved by accounting for temporal variations in fMRI.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hbm.26415",""

These alternative fuels are mostly comprised of aliphatic hydrocarbons and have low to no aromatic content. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has approved several drop‐in fuels, in which alternative fuels are typically blended with conventional Jet A fuel. Because of blending, the drop‐in fuels consist of both aliphatic and aromatic components. To achieve a fundamental understanding of how individual aliphatic and aromatic components interact with the aerospace‐grade composites, we have considered four model fuels, three aliphatic with varying chain lengths and one aromatic. The absorption of these model fuels by composites in three absorption/desorption cycles was captured and compared to the conventional Jet A fuel. The equilibrium weight gain by the composites due to absorption was low but was different for each model fuel, and the trend could be validated using Hansen solubility parameters. The absorption of model fuels decreased the glass transition temperature of composites. The change in glass transition temperature was not significantly different between the model fuels and the conventional fuel. These results can be translated to alternative fuels, making them a possible substitute for Jet A in the aviation industry.","",""

Using scaling analyses, we assess the changing relationship between flute length and point length in a large sample of each type. Researchers use scaling to investigate the physical constraints of an object and determine how its dimensions change with size. We compare the strength and consistency of the scaling relationships between the older Clovis and the younger Folsom with the aim of shedding light on scaling differences, if any, over their temporal span. Our results show that there is a significant difference in the relationship of fluting length to point length between these types. In Folsom point manufacture, flute length increases nearly twice as fast with increasing point length than in Clovis. Importantly, the scaling of flute length to point length relationship is isometric (linear) in the Folsom sample, whereas it is allometric (sublinear) in the Clovis sample. In other words, Folsom flintknappers maintained a constant ratio of flute length to point length. Clovis flintknappers were less concerned about maintaining this ratio. We attribute this difference to a potentially increasing, or changing, functional role of fluting in Folsom.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/arcm.12921",""

A positive matrix factorization (PMF) method was applied to interpret possible contamination sources. A 25-year dataset (1989–2014) comprising 12 water quality variables from three sites was used. Runoff connectivity analyses identified high-producing grassland (HG) as the most dominant pollution class in all sub-catchments. Univariate analyses revealed that nutrients and sediments were higher than in the initial monitoring years.

Samples from over 50 locations were analyzed for six species by using phylogenetic and haplotype network approaches to assess genetic diversity across geographic ranges and to refine the distributions of species in this group. The results indicate that Mexican species have diversified following multiple, independent invasions from Middle America. Two species found north of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB) and one transversal species exhibited weak phylogenetic structure, likely due to the lack of physiographic barriers, recent colonization, and high dispersal rates among regions. In contrast, three species found south of the TMVB exhibited strong phylogenetic structure, reflecting a longer presence in the area and multiple physiographic barriers that isolated populations.

In fact, many individuals form serious relationships within two years of filing for divorce. How people form relationships after divorce tends to vary, however, as some date multiple partners, some date only one partner, and some do not date at all. Evolutionary theory provides a theoretical foundation to explain the differences among individuals in terms of approaches, timing, and the number of co-occurring relationships surrounding the formation of romantic relationships again after divorce. The goal of this chapter is to discuss post-divorce relationship formation processes, variables that influence the maintenance of these relationships, and the consequences of forming post-divorce relationships from an evolutionary perspective. Additionally, we discuss the implications of post-divorce romance and provide some guidance for future studies to better understand how and why individuals form relationships after divorce, as well as the consequences of post-divorce relationships for all individuals involved.","https://academic.oup.com/edited-volume/45634/chapter/396143204",""

While the sense of belonging and its link to retention have been studied based on student characteristics, there is an absence of studies investigating the importance of students' social identities to their sense of belonging in engineering. Purpose/Hypothesis: This study examines differences in race/ethnic identity centrality, gender identity centrality, and sense of belonging in engineering by subgroups of undergraduate engineering students at Hispanic‐Serving Institutions (HSIs). Subsequently, it examines the extent to which these identity centralities predict a sense of belonging in engineering for each subgroup. Design/Method: Survey data was collected from 903 Latinx and 452 White undergraduate engineering students from seven HSIs across the continental United States. Multivariate analysis of variance and sequential multivariate linear regression were used to evaluate the research questions. Results: Latinx students had higher identity centralities but a similar sense of belonging in the engineering community as White students. Latinos and Latinas had an equivalent sense of belonging in engineering, whereas White women were higher than White men. In the full models, race/ethnic identity centrality significantly, and positively predicted a sense of belonging in engineering for Latinos and White women. Gender identity centrality was not a significant predictor of a sense of belonging in engineering for either Latinx or White students. Conclusions: Race/ethnic and gender identity centrality are differentially important to the sense of belonging in engineering for students at Hispanic‐Serving Institutions based on their group membership at the intersection of race and gender.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jee.20510",""

The histone deacetylases are transcriptional regulators whose role within the regulatory chromatin and consequence on the CLL transcriptome is poorly characterized. Here, we profiled and integrated the genome-wide occupancy of HDAC1, BRD4, H3K27Ac, and H3K9Ac signals with chromatin accessibility, Pol2 occupancy, and target expression signatures in CLL cells. We identified that when HDAC1 was recruited within super-enhancers (SEs) marked by acetylated H3K27 and BRD4, it functioned as a transcriptional activator that drove the de novo expression of select genes to facilitate survival and progression in CLL. Targeting HDACs reduced BRD4 and Pol2 engagement to downregulate the transcript and proteins levels of specific oncogenic driver genes in CLL such as BLK, a key mediator of the B-cell receptor pathway, core transcription factors such as PAX5 and IKZF3, and the antiapoptotic gene, BCL2. Concurrently, HDAC1, when recruited in the absence of SEs, repressed target gene expression. HDAC inhibition reversed silencing of a defined set of protein-coding and noncoding RNA genes. We focused on a specific set of microRNA genes and showed that their upregulation was inversely correlated with the expression of CLL-specific survival, transcription factor, and signaling genes. Our findings identify that the transcriptional activator and repressor functions of HDACs cooperate within the same tumor to establish the transcriptional dependencies essential for survival in CLL.","https://ashpublications.org/bloodadvances/article-pdf/7/12/2897/2060193/blooda_adv-2022-007998-main.pdf",""

But some E. coli strains are pathogenic and can cause deadly infections. Antimicrobial resistant E. coli is associated with more than 1.5 million deaths globally. Here, we studied the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in E. coli isolates from two cities based on the antimicrobial(AMR) genes and MIC values. By correlating genotypic and phenotypic antimicrobial resistance, we also examined the performance of whole genome sequencing (WGS) based prediction of phenotypic resistance. Methods: A total 109 E. coli isolates from Detroit, MI and Cleveland, OH hospitals underwent WGS. Antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) was performed using the gram-negative AST cards on the VITEK 2 system. WGS was performed with Nextseq 550 using Nextera flex kits. After de novo assembly, AMR genes were identified using AMR gene database, ResFinder. Results: The resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics including 1st and 3rd generation cephalosporins were very high among the E. coli isolates. They were susceptible to penicillin combinations and 2nd generation cephalosporins. While resistance to quinolone antibiotics was high, resistance to aminoglycoside, tetracycline, and sulfonamide/trimethoprim were relatively low (Figure 1). As shown in Table 1, WGS-based method accurately predicted the majority of antimicrobial resistance phenotypes with accuracy of 0.89 ∼ 1.0. However, for cephalothin (0.36), piperacillin/tazobactam (0.69), and amikacin (0.63), the prediction accuracy was low which could potentially lead to false predictions of antimicrobial resistance. Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) genes such as blaCTX-M, blaOXA, and blaTEM were abundant, though subtle difference in the prevalence of AMR genes between two cities was observed (Figure 2).Figure 1.The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance to various antibiotics in E. coli isolates from Detroit, MI and Cleveland, OH.Figure 2.Prevalence of WGS identified AMR genes associated with antibiotics drugs. Conclusion: Most of the E. coli isolates contained various ESBL genes and their gyrA genes were mutated to quinolone resistant forms. Therefore, most of the isolates were resistant to many beta-lactam and quinolone drugs. WGS based prediction of phenotypic resistance showed good predictive values but needs more studies to increase sensitivity and specificity. Disclosures: Keith S.

The age‐phased recruitment hypothesis posits that fish spawn downstream and move upstream as they age and grow, the static population with growth and mortality gradients hypothesis posits that fish spawn throughout a riverscape and growth is greater upstream while recruitment is greater downstream, and the colonization cycle hypothesis posits that fish spawn upstream, larvae drift downstream, and individuals move upstream as they age and grow. Methods: We tested for the larger‐fish‐upstream pattern using populations of Silver Chub Result: The larger‐fish‐upstream pattern was temporally persistent in both riverscapes. In the Arkansas River, reproductive investment was greatest upstream, where initiation of spawning likely occurred based on gonadosomatic indices. Adult fish were most numerous in the Arkansas River 125–175 km upstream from Kaw Reservoir, with age‐2 fish numbers peaking farther upstream compared with age‐1 fish. In the Ohio River, age‐0 fish counts increased downstream and were rare among the shortest river fragments (<100 km) between lock‐and‐dam structures. These findings are inconsistent with the age‐phased recruitment hypothesis based on upstream spawning in the Arkansas River and inconsistent with the static population with growth and mortality gradients hypothesis based on virtual absence of age‐2 fish downstream (Arkansas River) and age‐0 fish upstream (Ohio River). The most likely explanation for longitudinal variation in Silver Chub size distribution is downstream drift of ichthyoplankton followed by net upstream movement (i.e., colonization cycle hypothesis), but formal assessments of movement and ova characteristics require more research. Conclusion: Managing multidimensional riverscapes requires insight into the mechanisms that regulate upstream‐to‐downstream patterns in fish populations, and our work underscores a potential size‐related benefit to maintaining broadscale longitudinal connectivity.","https://afspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/nafm.10903",""

Prenatal stress tended to impact the proportion of bulls that reached puberty but had no impact on the percentage that reached sexual maturity by 22 months of age. Prenatal stress also impacted the proportion of sperm with DNA damage, but did not impact scrotal circumference, motility, MMP, or ROS. Stage of sexual maturity impacted scrotal circumference, motility, and MMP, but did not impact ROS. In summary, PNS may impact the ability to reach puberty, but did not impact sperm characteristics from prepuberty to sexual maturity.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/101/Supplement_3/224/52957439/skad281.272.pdf",""

These traits can impact producer profitability and efficiency. Feed intake and, to a lesser degree, water intake have been studied previously. However, there is limited research on the animal behaviors associated with intake and the literature lacks standardized phenotypes for these behaviors. The objective of this study was to estimate heritabilities and variance components for feed and water intake behavior traits in feedlot steers. An Insentec system (Hokofarm Group, The Netherlands) was used to obtain feed (n = 824) and water (n = 786) intakes from crossbred steers for 70 days. Daily dry matter intake (DMI) and daily water intake (DWI) records were used to compute five behaviors for both feed and water intake: number of sessions (NS), intake rate (IR), session size (SS), time per session (TS), and session interval (SI). A mixed linear model was fit for all traits to estimate variance components and heritabilities with a base model including the fixed effects group(pen) and breed composition and the random effect animal. Additional covariates were tested and added to the base model if improved model fit. Heritabilities for feed intake behaviors were 0.50 ± 0.12, 0.63 ± 0.12, 0.40 ± 0.13, 0.35 ± 0.12, and 0.60 ± 0.12 for NS, IR, SS, TS, and SI, respectively. Heritabilities for water intake behaviors were 0.56 ±0.11, 0.88 ± 0.07, 0.70 ± 0.11, 0.54 ± 0.12, and 0.80 ± 0.10 for NS, IR, SS, TS, and SI, respectively. Dry matter intake and DWI had heritabilities of 0.57 ± 0.11 and 0.44 ± 0.11, respectively. Bivariate models including feed intake behaviors and DMI as well as bivariate models including water intake behaviors and DWI were used to obtain correlations between intake and intake behaviors. Phenotypic correlations varied widely between pairs of traits for both feed and water intake behaviors (-0.83 to 0.82). Genetic correlations between DMI and feed intake behaviors were moderate to high (-0.64 ± 0.34 to 0.49 ± 0.16), while genetic correlations between DWI and water intake behaviors were low to moderate (-0.37 ± 0.14 to 0.48 ± 0.15). Significant (log10P-value ≥ 4.5) SNPs were identified for the feed and water intake behaviors. The number of significant SNPs identified for feed intake traits, NS, IR, SS, TS, SI, and DMI were 3, 10, 8, 8, 5, and 5, respectively. The number of significant SNPs identified for water intake traits, NS, IR, SS, TS, SI, and DWI were 4, 8, 3, 2, 5, and 4, respectively. Candidate genes and previously reported quantitative trait loci near significant SNPs were identified. The results indicated that feed and water intake behaviors are heritable and may be one additional route to evaluating feed and water intake.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/101/Supplement_3/344/52957481/skad281.409.pdf",""

In this review, we synthesize existing research across disciplines to establish a theoretical model of mindfulness and safety. Based on 32 empirical studies, we first summarize and critically analyze how mindfulness and safety are conceptualized and operationalized in the literature. We then consolidate empirical findings and conceptual arguments and draw upon the job demands–resources model to propose a theoretical model linking the basic benefits of mindfulness to safety‐related job demands. Specifically, we propose that mindfulness (a) improves detection of and responses to workplace risks and hazards, (b) enhances concentration and self‐monitoring of safety behaviors in cognitively demanding situations, and (c) facilitates more adaptive responses to emotional burdens. We further propose that the mindfulness–safety link can vary across boundary conditions, including personal and contextual characteristics. Our theoretical model serves as a foundation to integrate existing knowledge and guide future research. We conclude by highlighting specific opportunities for researchers and practitioners to advance research and applications of mindfulness and workplace safety.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/job.2705",""

One approach for enhancing the design of the transition of control mechanisms is to predict driver behavior during a takeover by analyzing his/her state before a takeover. Although there is a wealth of existing literature on modeling the prediction of driver behavior, little is known about the prediction of takeover performance (e.g., driver error) and its underlying data structure (e.g., window sizes or the inclusion of certain features). Thus, the goal of this study is to predict driver error during a takeover event using supervised machine learning algorithms for various window sizes. Three machine learning algorithms (i.e., decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine with a radial basis kernel) were applied to granular driving performance, physiological, and glance data from a driving simulator experiment examining automated vehicle driving. The results showed that a random forest algorithm with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.72, trained on a 3 s window before the takeover time, had the best performance with regard to classifying driver error accurately. In addition, we identified the 10 most important predictors that resulted in the best error prediction performance. The results of this study could be useful in developing algorithms for driver state that could be integrated into highly automated systems and, potentially, improve the takeover process.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/03611981231159122",""

Functionalist and identity theories suggest that individuals engage in support exchanges with social ties that are consistent with their identities/roles to maximize their well-being. This study examined support exchanges with friends in daily life and tested the link between support exchanges with friends and daily well-being, particularly how this link varied between married and unmarried older adults. Adults aged 65+ (N = 292, Mean age = 73.72, 60% married) provided information about their demographics and social partners. Across five days, they completed surveys about support exchanges with friends (i.e., receiving or giving advice, practical support, and emotional support, respectively) and daily life satisfaction at the end of each day. Multilevel logistic models revealed that unmarried older adults were more likely to receive all types of support from friends and also more likely to provide advice and emotional support (non-tangible support) to friends than married older adults. Support provision was unrelated to life satisfaction. On days when older adults received advice from friends, they reported increased life satisfaction than on days that they did not (within-person association). This within-person association was stronger among unmarried than married older adults. Patterns of findings remained unchanged after adjusting for support exchanges with other social ties. Findings highlight the role of marital status in older adults’ daily support exchanges. Unmarried older adults may compensate for the lack of a spouse with friends and are more reactive to daily support exchanges than married older adults.","https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/7/Supplement_1/457/54739849/igad104.1504.pdf",""

The ways in which humans and nature interact have traditionally been characterized and influenced by competing intrinsic and utilitarian values. However, recently, relational values and relational models have been used to unpack the myriad of values society assigns to nature and create general typologies of nature–human relationships. Here, we investigate the spectrum of environmental values that exist in the San Marcos River (SMR)—a social–ecological system (SES) in which a spring-fed river flows through an urban environment in central Texas (USA) including a university campus that attracts regional and international tourists. Recognizing that scholars have struggled to identify a nuanced understanding of environmental values and how these values shape nature–human relationships in SES, we use the SMR case study to capture the nature–human relational models that exist among social and user groups of the blue space. Analyzing different groups of visitors and stakeholders of the SMR (n = 3145), this study serves as a pilot to apply relational models using a variety of metrics to build a framework for understanding models of nature–human relationships, beyond ecosystem services and dualistic valuations. In our sample, most respondents were classified under the stewardship model (59%). The utilization model (34%) was the second most common, followed by wardship (6%). We found that patterns of place identity emerged to support the development of relational models beyond utilization. Despite the differences among perceptions, values, and some variation in relational models, one commonality was the innate, ubiquitous preference to protect natural habitat, water quality, and the river’s aquifer water source. Our study contributes to the growing literature around relational values and is a pathway to integrate ecosystem services, environmental values, and human–environment interactions into a more holistic approach to environmental valuation.","https://www.mdpi.com/2673-7086/3/2/12/pdf",""

However, in the context of calcium imaging, technological limitations only allow for partially overlapping layers of neurons in a brain region of interest to be jointly recorded. In this case, graph estimation for the full data requires inference for edge selection when many pairs of neurons have no simultaneous observations. This leads to the graph quilting problem, which seeks to estimate a graph in the presence of block‐missingness in the empirical covariance matrix. Solutions for the graph quilting problem have previously been studied for Gaussian graphical models; however, neural activity data from calcium imaging are often non‐Gaussian, thereby requiring a more flexible modelling approach. Thus, in our work, we study two approaches for nonparanormal graph quilting based on the Gaussian copula graphical model, namely, a maximum likelihood procedure and a low rank‐based framework. We provide theoretical guarantees on edge recovery for the former approach under similar conditions to those previously developed for the Gaussian setting, and we investigate the empirical performance of both methods using simulations as well as real data calcium imaging data. Our approaches yield more scientifically meaningful functional connectivity estimates compared to existing Gaussian graph quilting methods for this calcium imaging data set.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/am-pdf/10.1002/sta4.623",""

We study a model in which firms decide whether to adopt either their locally preferred accounting methods or a common method, followed by an investor allocating capital across firms. Firms’ choices of a common method are strategic complements in attaining more comparable reports. As a result, multiple equilibria may exist. Specifically, an equilibrium in which firms use their local methods always exists. However, an equilibrium in which firms adopt a common method exists if uniformity improves comparability significantly and firm-specific productivity shocks are large relative to the common productivity shock. Firms may fail to coordinate on adopting the Pareto-dominant accounting method, which may not even emerge as an equilibrium if investments exhibit substitutability. These coordination problems provide accounting regulation an opportunity to facilitate efficient capital allocation, thus providing a microfoundation for accounting measurement regulation.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article-pdf/99/1/139/103550/i0001-4826-99-1-139.pdf",""

This study was carried out to determine the frequency and characteristics of resistant bacteria linked with environmental fomites in a tertiary institution in Nigeria as part of global efforts to provide information to contain the spread of antimicrobial resistance.<br /> <b>Methods: </b>300 swab samples, determined by factorial design, were aseptically collected from 10 fomites in 10 locations in three different facilities at Obafemi Awolowo University, Nigeria, and transported to the laboratory for processing. The isolates were identified by standard procedure and the Microbact<sup>TM</sup> identification kit. The susceptibility profile of the isolates was determined using Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion technique. MDR bacteria were examined for the presence of plasmids using the alkali lysis method, and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, and methicillin resistance genes by polymerase chain reaction.<br /> <b>Results:</b> 89 diverse bacteria were isolated from fomites in the study environment. <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>(49.4%) predominated among the bacteria, followed by <i>Staphylococcus saprophyticus</i> (10.1%), <i>Providencia stuartti</i> (5.6%), <i>Proteus vulgaris</i> (4.5%), and<i> Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (3.4%).

Here, we use single-cell expression data from a Prairie rattlesnake (Crotalus viridis) venom gland to evaluate hypotheses for signaling networks underlying snake venom regulation and the degree to which different venom gene families have evolutionarily recruited distinct regulatory architectures. Our findings suggest that snake venom regulatory systems have evolutionarily co-opted trans-regulatory factors from extracellular signal-regulated kinase and unfolded protein response pathways that specifically coordinate expression of distinct venom toxins in a phased sequence across a single population of secretory cells. This pattern of co-option results in extensive cell-to-cell variation in venom gene expression, even between tandemly duplicated paralogs, suggesting this regulatory architecture has evolved to circumvent cellular constraints. While the exact nature of such constraints remains an open question, we propose that such regulatory heterogeneity may circumvent steric constraints on chromatin, cellular physiological constraints (e.g., endoplasmic reticulum stress or negative protein–protein interactions), or a combination of these. Regardless of the precise nature of these constraints, this example suggests that, in some cases, dynamic cellular constraints may impose previously unappreciated secondary constraints on the evolution of gene regulatory networks that favors heterogeneous expression.","https://academic.oup.com/gbe/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/gbe/evad109/50598759/evad109.pdf",""

We find a negative association between code of ethics quality and cash holdings, which suggests that managers hold less cash when the firm has a strong code of ethics in place. The effect is greater when agency costs are elevated due to weaker country‐level investor protections.

Identifying compounds that improve health span and extend life span, called geroprotectors, could be crucial to preventing or at least delaying the onset of age-related diseases. In this regard, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is emerging as an easy, efficient, low-cost model system to screen natural products and identify novel geroprotectors. Phenolic acids can be found in a wide range of natural products that are part of the human diet. Vanillic acid (VA) is a phenolic acid that has previously been attributed with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective features. To determine whether these beneficial health effects amount to an extension of health span and life span, in this work, we thoroughly explore the effect of VA on C. elegans stress resistance and life span. We found that VA increases thermotolerance (19.4%), reduces protein aggregation (between 30% and 40%), improves motility, and extends life span by almost 50%, an extent hardly ever achieved with a natural compound. The increased thermotolerance induced by VA is independent of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling pathway but requires heat shock factor-1 and is associated with increased heat shock protein-4 (HSP-4) and hsp-16.2 expression. These results provide new insight into understanding the therapeutical properties of VA and warrant further investigation of VA as a novel geroprotector.","https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/gerona/glad086/50214000/glad086.pdf",""

The limited shelf life of platelet products severely compromises platelet inventory. We hypothesized that cold storage of platelets in 100% plasma using xenon gas under high pressure would extend shelf life to 14 days. Study Design and Methods: Double apheresis platelet units were collected and split equally between two bags. One unit was placed in a hyperbaric chamber, pressurized to 4 bars with a xenon/oxygen gas mixture, and placed in a refrigerator for 14 days (Xe). The remaining unit was aliquoted into mini‐bags (10 ml) for storage at room temperature (RTP) or in cold (CSP). Samples were assayed on days 5 (RTP) or 14 (Xe and CSP) for count, metabolism, clot strength, platelet aggregation, and activation markers. Results: The platelet count in Xe samples was lower than that of RTP but significantly higher than CSP. Despite similar levels of glucose and lactate, the pH of Xe samples was significantly lower than CSP. Glycoprotein expression was better preserved by Xe storage compared to CSP, but no differences in activation were observed. Thromboelastography and aggregometry results were comparable between all groups.

Sites with lower volumes were more difficult to predict, with considerable error in even the best-performing models. City-specific models in general exhibited improved fit and prediction performance. Expected prediction error increased by a factor of about 1.4 when using Strava or StreetLight alone, but without static adjustment variables, to predict AADBT. Combining Strava plus StreetLight, but without static variables, increased error slightly less; by 1.3 times. We also found that transferring the model specifications from one year to the next without re-estimating the model parameters resulted in a 10% to 50% increase in error rates across models, so such transfer is not recommended. The findings from this study indicate that rather than replacing conventional bike data sources and count programs, old “small” data sources will likely be very important for big data sources like Strava and StreetLight to achieve their potential for predicting AADBT.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/03611981231182388",""

This rubbish plastic can end up in the cotton at the gin if not removed before harvest. These bags may not only cause problems in the ginning process but might also become embedded in cotton fibers, reducing the quality and marketable value. Therefore, detecting, locating, and removing the bags before the cotton is harvested is required. Manually detecting and locating these bags in cotton fields is a tedious, time-consuming, and costly process. To solve this, this paper shows the application of YOLOv5 to detect white and brown colored plastic bags tangled at three different heights in cotton plants (bottom, middle, top) using Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS)-acquired Red, Green, Blue (RGB) images. It was found that an average white and brown bag could be detected at 92.35% and 77.87% accuracies and a mean average precision (mAP) of 87.68%. Similarly, the trained YOLOv5 model, on average, could detect 94.25% of the top, 49.58% of the middle, and only 5% of the bottom bags. It was also found that both the color of the bags (p < 0.001) and their height on cotton plants (p < 0.0001) had a significant effect on detection accuracy. The findings reported in this paper can help in the autonomous detection of plastic contaminants in cotton fields and potentially speed up the mitigation efforts, thereby reducing the amount of contaminants in cotton gins.","https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/13/7/1365/pdf",""

We find that executives' and directors' insider trading profits from sales are lower for companies headquartered in states with greater enforcement of non‐compete agreements. The path analyses suggest that high enforcement of non‐compete agreements disincentivizes managers to profit from their information advantage to avoid the possibility of job termination and the cost of job terminations. We also find that insiders in companies headquartered in states with greater enforcement of non‐compete agreements are less likely to exploit their information advantage by timing their sales before unfavorable corporate earnings announcements.

However, these synergistic energy pathways can be modeled using a series of mechanistic relationships describing forage resource distribution and animal behavior, each which can be observed with high levels of accuracy and precision using biometric sensors and remote sensing technology. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the coordination of data inputs into a coherent framework utilizing biometric and remote sensing technology. Crossbred steers (n = 10) were fitted with GPS and video tracking collars (Vectronic) and accelerometers (Wildbytes technologies), then managed for 286 days as part of a broader research grazing ecology project on pasture (~11.54 hectare) comprised of bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon) and tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) and equipped with an automated walk-over-weigh (TruTest) scale system. Distribution of forage quality was sampled monthly with a ½ m2 quadrat using a 20 x 20-meter grid (n = 297) and remotely assessed via an unmanned aerial vehicle (Matrice 100) mounted hyperspectral camera (MicaSense) at 8 cm resolution. Animal behavior was predicted utilizing a trained randomforest prediction algorithm, and linked to geo-location and forage quality at the spatial-temporal scale in Program R. We then constructed animal ethogram, distribution of forage quality, and spatial-temporal distribution of animal behavior across the grazing landscape for a test period. We found steers allocated the greatest proportion of time to grazing and resting behaviors, 30 and 60% respectively, with the remainder dedicated to ruminating and walking behaviors. A diurnal, circadian rhythm in animal behavior demonstrates that steers grazed between 0900 and 1000 in the morning, and again between 1300 and 2000 in the evening, while resting behavior dominated the hours between 0300 and 0900, with a slight increase in grazing behavior noted at 0600, or approximately sunrise. Animal behavior linked forage availability showed steers selectively grazed areas with higher NDVI signatures, while seeking sources of water and cover to practice resting behavior. Given the need to develop robust models predicting forage intake and energy in grazing animals to improve sustainability and environmental metrics, animal tracking and biometric technologies offer a vital solution to improving management of extensively managed grazing livestock.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/101/Supplement_3/80/52957103/skad281.097.pdf",""

We used the fifth-round survey of 6019 rural households from 25 provinces, collected between July and August 2022 by the Food and Agriculture Organization. We used binary logistic regression to examine the association between household characteristics and HFI. The majority of household heads were male (97.8%) with no education (62.8%). The findings showed that female-headed households had significantly higher odds of severe HFI. Household heads with any level of formal education had significantly reduced odds of severe HFI, while the odds of severe HFI was not different among those with religious/informal household-head education compared to those with no education. Likewise, engagement in any type of agricultural activity decreased the odds of severe HFI. Additionally, household income per member was negatively, while household size was positively associated with severe HFI. In summary, interventions to alleviate HFI among rural households should prioritize income-generating opportunities and skills targeting households with female heads, low levels of household-head education, larger size, no agricultural activities, and low income.","https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/7/1681/pdf",""

This qualitative study aimed to understand perspectives of ED staff about ED PT consultation for older adults with falls and fall‐related complaints, specifically regarding perceived value and associated challenges and strategies. Methods: We performed focus groups and key informant interviews with emergency physicians, advanced practice clinicians, nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and technicians who perform ED geriatric screenings. We used rapid qualitative analysis to identify common themes related to decisions to consult PT from the ED, perceived value of PT, and common challenges and strategies in ED PT consultation. Results: Twenty‐five participants in 4 focus groups and 3 interviews represented 22 distinct institutions with ED PT consultation available for older adults with falls. About two thirds of EDs represented relied on clinician gestalt to request PT consultation (n = 15, 68%), whereas one third used formal consultation pathways (n = 7, 32%). Participants valued physical therapists’ expertise, time, and facilitation of hospital throughput by developing safe discharge plans and contact with patients to improve outpatient follow‐up. Common challenges included limited ED PT staffing and space for PT evaluations; strategies to promote ED PT consultation included advocating for leadership buy‐in and using ED observation units to monitor patients and avoid admission until PT consultation was available. Conclusion: ED PT consultation for older adults with falls may benefit patients, ED staff, and hospital throughput. Uncertainty remains over whether geriatric screening‐triggered consultation versus emergency clinician gestalt successfully identifies patients likeliest to benefit from ED PT evaluation. Leadership buy‐in, designated consultation space, and formalized consultation pathways are strategies to address current challenges in ED PT consultation.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/emp2.12941",""

We focused on how plant gene expression was altered by six fungal strains that generated “water-saver” and “water-spender” drought physiologies in a C4 grass, Panicum hallii. Water-saver physiologies have lower plant water loss, improved wilt resistance, and higher survival compared with water-spender strategies. We expected that fungi within each functional group would have similar effects on P. hallii, and this was largely true for plant physiology but not for plant gene expression. When we focused only on genes that were differentially expressed relative to fungus-free controls, we found surprisingly little overlap in plant differentially expressed genes or gene regulatory pathways across the fungal treatments, including within and between the water-saver and water-spender strategies. Nevertheless, using lasso regression, we identified a small subset of genes that predicted 39 and 53% of the variation in plant wilt resistance and water loss, respectively. These results suggest that fungal effects on plant transcription may identify how they extend the plant phenotype, and the comparison across multiple fungi allows us to differentiate broadly fungal-responsive plant genes versus those plant genes that respond only to single fungal taxa. The genes identified here could be targeted for future study to understand their function and, ultimately, represent candidates for precision breeding efforts to increase plant drought tolerance.","https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/pdf/10.1094/PBIOMES-01-22-0006-FI",""

The objectives of this study were 1) to explore the genetic component and environmental sensitivity (ES) of dry matter intake (DMI) to water restriction (WR), and 2) to evaluate genetic-by-environment interactions (G×E) with respect to WR using a reaction norm. A group of 788 crossbred steers arranged across seven cohorts were provided feed and water whereby daily water intake (WI) and DMI values were recorded automatically on an individual basis. After an initial acclimation period, data were collected for 70 days in which ad libitum water was provided and baseline WI was determined on each steer. Next, steers were restricted by approximately 10% of their baseline WI every seven days until 50% WR was achieved and subsequently maintained for 42 days. The reaction norm was modeled with a linear random regression allowing for additive genetic animal-specific intercepts and slope parameters as a function of the WR environmental covariate. The relationship covariance matrix for the additive genetic animal parameters was estimated using genotypes. The model was fit using the THR3GIBBSf90 program in the BLUPf90 software. The additive genetic variances for animal-specific intercepts and WR-driven slopes, as well as their covariance, were estimated. The estimated (posterior median and 95% highest posterior density) ES to WR, represented by the regression coefficient on the WR covariate, was -0.410 (-0.422, -0.399) kg daily DMI per 10% WR, indicating evidence for population-level DMI sensitivity to WR. The estimated additive genetic correlation between animal-specific intercept (i.e., ad libitum WI) and animal-specific slope (i.e., sensitivity to WR) was -0.75 (-0.88, -0.59), supporting an association between selection for increased DMI at ad libitum WI and ES. The additive genetic correlation between DMI at 0% and 25% WR was estimated at 0.96 (0.94, 0.99) and at 0% and 50% WR was 0.78 (0.65, 0.91), thereby indicating G×E had limited influence on the overall EBV ranking of animals as WR increased. The results of this study do not indicate major G×E concerns in DMI with respect to WR in the overall population; however, ES to WR may be important to producers as selection on DMI at ad libitum WI could increase ES.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/101/Supplement_3/349/52957913/skad281.414.pdf",""

These TEC enhancements are observed during the June solstice afternoon hours, last for a few hours, are constrained to regions of eastward magnetic declination, and occur at magnetic latitudes poleward of 20°. During the December solstice, similar TEC enhancements are seen over the southern coast of Brazil and northern Argentina, also poleward of 20°, but in a region where the declination is westward. Using a physics-based model, it is proposed that the TEC enhancements are produced by an equatorward meridional wind but intensified by the zonal component of the wind, blowing at longitudes where the Earth’s magnetic declination differs from zero. Due to their location near + 23° latitude (tropic of Cancer) in the northern hemisphere and near − 23° latitude (tropic of Capricorn) in the southern hemisphere, the TEC enhancements have been named the tropical TEC enhancement.","https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2942729/v1",""

However, this work can be time-consuming and laborious because invertebrate identification often requires considerable taxonomic training and expertise. The collection and analysis of environmental DNA (eDNA), the genetic material that organisms shed into their surrounding environment, represents a potentially revolutionary approach for rapid and accurate invertebrate surveillance in freshwater environments. Previous studies have demonstrated that fish eDNA tends to be more abundant in freshwater lake sediments than the water column above, so we conducted an experiment to examine whether this pattern holds true for freshwater invertebrates. We collected paired samples from benthic sediments and the water column at ten sites around an urban playa lake in Lubbock, Texas. Based on cycle threshold values from quantitative PCR (qPCR) amplification with universal invertebrate primers targeting the COI gene, a paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Spearman rank-order correlation suggested that invertebrate eDNA quantities were correlated between the sediment and water column but consistently more concentrated in the water compared to the sediment below, directly contrasting with previous studies of fish eDNA. Future work combining eDNA detection and high-throughput sequencing (i.e., metabarcoding) will increase understanding of how eDNA signals relate to local invertebrate pools and increase the utility of eDNA sampling for freshwater invertebrates.","https://meridian.allenpress.com/tjs/article-pdf/doi/10.32011/txjsci_75_1_Article5/3358299/i0040-4403-75-1-article_5.pdf",""

RHEAs containing Al, often exhibit a checkered pattern microstructure comprising a combination of disordered BCC and ordered B2 phases. Since the ordered B2 phase is based on the BCC parent matrix, distinguishing these two phases can be rather challenging. Advanced characterization techniques are necessary for a reliable qualitative and quantitative analysis of BCC and B2 phases in RHEAs. Additionally, there is a tendency for transformation of the ordered B2 phase into more complex ordered-omega type phases that are usually deleterious to mechanical properties. The current study focuses on the phase stability of a candidate RHEA, Al0.5Mo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr. Correlative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atom probe tomography (APT) have been employed to investigate the phase stability and transformation pathway of this RHEA when isothermally annealed at 800°C. The results show that a metastable two-phase BCC + B2 microstructure formed at the early stages of decomposition, eventually transforming into a three-phase BCC + B2 + hP18 microstructure. The hP18 phase is an ordered omega derivative of the ordered B2 phase. The correlative microscopy techniques (TEM and APT) reveal a very interesting interplay of compositional partitioning between the different phases and their respective stability.","https://academic.oup.com/mam/article-pdf/29/1/303/49034077/s1431927622012053jra.pdf",""

Of the nearly 4 million breast cancer survivors, many, including individuals with metastatic breast cancer, will require lifelong treatment for chronic conditions. As part of a multi-site study including diverse tumor types, breast cancer survivors are being recruited to explore the feasibility and outcomes of a digital health coaching (DHC) program following the completion of primary therapy to support self-management of symptoms and general wellness. Trial design: A randomized-wait list control design will evaluate outcomes related to engagement in a DHC program following completion of primary therapy. Participants will be enrolled in a 6-month DHC program delivering evidence-based content via weekly calls, text, and email, in addition to usual support from their respective healthcare teams. The intervention group will receive coaching upon enrollment. The control group will receive coaching after a 6-month monitoring period. Twelve months of longitudinal clinical, patient-reported outcomes, activity tracking (via Fitbit), and microbiome data will be collected from both groups. Eligibility criteria: The breast cancer cohort will consist of individuals with both localized and metastatic disease within 1 year of completion of primary therapy, defined as treatment of curative intent, first-line or later, from which the individual is advancing to active surveillance or follow-up, with or without maintenance therapy. All study participants must be &gt;18 years old, able to read and speak English, have access to mobile technology, and agree to wear and have data collected from an activity tracker. Specific aims: 1) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of a DHC program and its effect on participant health self-efficacy; 2) characterize associations between participant symptoms, physical/psychosocial well-being, and health self-management and gut microbiota changes; and 3) explore patient-generated health data outcomes among participants (patient reported and wearable biometrics outcomes). Statistical methods: Feasibility and acceptability will be assessed through descriptive statistics. Feasibility for this study is defined as a retention rate ≥70%, and acceptability is defined as ≤20% scoring “not at all helpful.” Secondary aims will be assessed using linear mixed models. Cross-cohort analysis of physical function, measured by the PROMIS Physical Function 10a, will be conducted. Assuming a power of 0.8 and significance level of .05, we will be able to detect a 2.51 difference in PROMIS score means between the control and intervention group (SD 10) with a sample of 500 total participants. Sub-group analysis will be conducted with the anticipated 250 participants in the breast cancer cohort with a focus on feasibility, acceptability, and descriptive and exploratory endpoints for this population as a whole and comparing early stage and metastatic participants.
