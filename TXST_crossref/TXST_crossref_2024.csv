Recent research suggests that wakeful rest (WR), i,e., a period in which attention and other cognitive demands are reduced, May also facilitate memory consolidation. However other studies have failed to find such benefits of WR. Complicating matters, several methodological differences across successful and unsuccessful WR studies exist, including differences in learning material and test format. This experiment examined how test format may influence the effects of WR on memory consolidation. Methods: Participants completed two consecutive sessions. In each session, they watched a 15-min video and then took an immediate memory test followed by a 15-min break while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. During the break, participants engaged in WR by sitting quietly in a comfortable chair in one session and completed a computer game distractor test in the other. Next, participants took a delayed memory test for the video and then completed a mind wandering questionnaire. For 16 participants, the memory test were multiple-choice and for 15 participants, the memory test were free recall. Results: For participants who took multiple-choice test, let’s forgetting occururred from the immediate to the delayed memory test when participants engaged in WR compared to a distractor task during the break, and this difference was larger for participants who engaged in WR during the first session. For participants who took free recall test, although memory improved from the immediate to the delayed test during both sessions, there was no difference in size the improvement when participants engaged in WR compared to a distractor task during the break. Conclusion: The efficacy of WR or memory consolidation depends on the format in which memory is tested. In the current experiment, WR during the break was more effective than a distractor task for preserving memories when tests were in multiple-choice but not free-call format. Additionally, when using a within-participants design, the order in which WR and the distractor task are completed is also relevant. EEG and mind-wandering data may be useful in understanding context in which WR may be most effective for memory consolidation.

Cannabis production had been outlawed in the United States due to concerns related to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) intoxication. However, recent legislation has declassified hemp as a schedule 1 drug under regulated conditions (i.e., THC &lt; 0.3%). Thus, hemp has been reclassified as an agricultural commodity, and its production for fiber, food, and medicine has increased. Hemp cultivation results in by-products that are not utilized for human needs and have potential as livestock feed, especially for ruminants. Current regulations restrict the use of hemp and its by-products in livestock systems due to the presence of cannabinoids. Thus, research on the nutritional value of hemp for cattle is lacking. The objective of this study was to characterize the nutrient concentrations, in-vitro digestibility (IVD), and cannabinoid concentrations of different fractions of the hemp plant. Procedures involving animals were approved by IACUC at Texas State University (#8497). Four replications of hemp plants of the Cherry Soda varietal were cultivated at Texas State University. Samples were air-dried and fractionated into lower (n = 4), leaves (n = 4), stalks (n = 4), and whole plant (n = 4). Dry matter, organic matter (OM), acid detergent fiber (ADF), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and crude protein (CP) were determined. For IVD, samples were incubated in digestion vessels containing buffers and rumen fluid at 39.5°C for 48 h and subsequently analyzed for NDF. Cannabinoid analysis was conducted via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The OM was in acceptable ranges for each hemp fraction (69-95%). The NDF and ADF were within normal ranges of conventional livestock feeds and forages for most fractions, except hemp stalk (81% NDF, 69% ADF). There was high variability in CP between fractions, with the least concentrations observed in the stalk (4%) and greatest in the flower (25%). Stalks had an IVD of 21%, whole plant of 67%, flower of 87%, and leaves of 93%. Cannabinoids were present in each fraction and especially concentrated in the flower (14%) and depleted in the stalk (0.06%). Flower had THC of 0.56%, while other fractions were less than the 0.3% legal threshold. Similarly, total cannabidiol (CBD) ranged from 0.05-11.4% with the greatest concentrations in the flower and least in the stalk. Our results indicate there is potential for hemp to be integrated into cattle production, especially the leaves. Despite adequate nutritional value, there are practical limitations with feeding hemp flower to cattle. In-vivo trials are needed to assess digestibility and profile cannabinoid metabolism in various tissues before hemp can be integrated into cattle diets.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/102/Supplement_1/24/56821265/skae019.028.pdf",""

Commercially reared insects have been positioned as a potential protein source for livestock due to their nutritional value and decreased environmental footprint as compared with conventional protein feeds. The American Association of Feed Officials (AAFCO) has issued a definition for black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) as feed for certain livestock but has not yet authorized feeding BSFL to ruminants. Further, AAFCO has not provided a feed definition for other edible insects [e.g., mealworm larvae (MWL)], likely due to a lack of research evaluating the value of insects as feed. The objective of this study was to evaluate edible insect species as feed for cattle by determining in situ characteristics of multiple commercially reared species. This research was approved by Texas State University IACUC (#8693). Samples (n = 14) included five insect species [i.e., black soldier fly larvae (BSFL)], mealworm larvae (MWL), house cricket, grasshopper, and banded cricket] that were commercially reared on different feed inputs and with various processing parameters and BSFL frass, which is insect excreta. There were 6 samples of BSFL, two of MWL, and three of house crickets. Three ruminally cannulated steers were used and provided ad libitum hay and water. A 6-d trial period was performed including a 3-d adaptation and 3-d experimental incubation period. Samples incubated in the rumen at 7 timepoints in reverse order (0, 4, 6, 12, 14, 48, and 72 h). After incubation, residues were analyzed for partial dry matter (PDM), dry matter (DM), and organic matter (OM). Dry matter and OM were separated into immediately soluble (IS), potentially soluble (PS), and not soluble (NS) fractions. For DM, the average NS fraction was 6.2% with a range from 3.0 to 10.4%. The sample with the greatest NS fraction was grasshopper. Across samples, the average PS fraction was 74.5% with a range from 69.3 to 79.1%. The sample with the smallest PS fraction was BSFL frass whereas the sample with the greatest was BSFL. Multiple samples had a DM degradability &gt;85%. However, MWL and BSFL had fluctuating DM degradability across samples, likely due to variability among processing parameters. For OM fractionation, the average NS fraction was 5.7% with a range of 2.8 to 10.4%. Grasshopper had the greatest NS fraction. The average PS fraction was 74.9%; BSFL had the greatest PS fraction while frass had the least. Many samples had an OM degradability &gt;85% and frass had the greatest degradability (90.0%). There was great variability in OM degradability across house cricket samples, likely related to rearing diet. These findings indicate that BSFL and MWL have potential value as feed for cattle but there would be challenges associated with feeding crickets.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/102/Supplement_1/97/56821278/skae019.110.pdf",""

Metacognition, the awareness of one’s thought processes, is minimal during typical dreaming but is assumed to be greater during lucid dreams, when the dreamer is aware they are dreaming and can sometimes control dream content. Therefore, one hypothesis is that lucid dreams may be more continuous with waking life than non-lucid dreams and thus contain less bizarre content than non-lucid dreams. However, support for this hypothesis is mixed and it may be incomplete, as metacognition typically includes multiple components, including the awareness of thinking and the regulation of processes involved in thinking. Additionally, these various metacognitive aspects may be differentially influenced by personality. Methods: To further examine how dream bizarreness relates to metacognition, 416 participants completed a survey including measures of dreaming frequency, sleep quality, multiple aspects of metacognition, and the Big 5 personality traits. Participants also reported their most recent lucid and non-lucid dreams which were scored for bizarreness. Relationships between dream bizarreness, metacognition, and personality were subsequently assessed. Results: Seventy-eight participants were able to report both a lucid and non-lucid dream and contributed to analyses. In contrast to the continuity hypothesis, lucid dreams were more bizarre than non-lucid dreams, and regression analyses revealed that non-lucid dream bizarreness positively predicted awareness of dream dissociation, whereas higher lucid dream bizarreness was associated with fewer negative beliefs about uncontrollability and danger. Finally, higher neuroticism and lower conscientiousness were associated with higher negative beliefs about uncontrollability and danger. No relationships between personality and dream dissociation were present. Conclusion: The hypothesis that, due to greater metacognitive awareness, lucid dreams are less bizarre than non-lucid dreams, was not supported. Instead, bizarre non-lucid dreams may emerge with increased self-disconnection and bizarre lucid dreams may occur when worry about losing control and associated dangers therein is low. Additionally, due to the observed relationships between personality and metacognition, low neuroticism and high conscientiousness may also increase the bizarreness of lucid dreams. Collectively, these results suggest that dream bizarreness may reflect specific aspects of metacognition rather than a general awareness that one is dreaming.

Outliers were determined as values ± 2 standard deviations of the mean, and data were analyzed using PROC MIXED of SAS (v9.4) with the main effect of time. Horses increased in BW (P ≤ 0.01) over time, but BCS did not change (P = 0.25). Mean FEC increased over time (P ≤ 0.01), beginning on d 14, and remained increased to d 42 compared to baseline.

In 2021 alone there were 7,388 pedestrian fatalities and 60,577 injuries. Addressing this critical issue, our study introduced a novel methodology for predicting the severity of pedestrian crashes. This method leveraged advanced deep learning models such as Inception-ResNet-v2, Inception-v3, and Xception applied to synthetic data generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This study analyzed data related to pedestrian crash severity in Louisiana spanning five years (2016–2021), encompassing forty variables that include pedestrian demographics, accident location, and vehicle specifics. The severity of crashes was categorized into three categories: injury, no injury, and fatal. To combat the challenge of data imbalance, our study implemented a novel method that combined traditional sampling methods with GANs. This integrated methodology facilitated the generation of synthetic data utilizing the Conditional Tabular GAN (CTGAN) model and the attainment of balanced datasets by employing under-sampling via the Random Under Sampler (RUS) technique and over-sampling through the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). Thereafter, the DeepInsight technique was employed to transform numerical and categorical crash data into image format, making it compatible with the deep learning models utilized. The findings reveal that the models demonstrated improved predictive capabilities when applied to the over sampled dataset, which was achieved by increasing the number of instances in the minority class to balance the distribution of classes, as evidenced by various performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Specifically, the Inception-ResNet-v2, Inception-v3, and Xception models recorded predictive accuracies of 82.73%, 84.75%, and 69.07% respectively, with the over sampled dataset, which was the highest among the three sampling categories of data considering all the metrics.

Torque measurements are normally used to measure a sample’s anisotropy constant and can be determined directly using a torque magnetometer (TM) or indirectly using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). Most TM only operate at room temperature. However, a biaxial VSM allows straightforward torque measurements at varying temperatures. VSM torque curves comprise a 2θ background caused by small misalignments of the sample on the sample rod, and/or a non-azimuthal symmetric sample shape. These errors originate from the position dependence of the pickup coil sensitivity matrix. Here, the magnetic torque of a strontium ferrite/PA-12 3D printed samples was explored using biaxial VSM and compared to measurements done with a true torque magnetometer. Torque curves were taken from 16-22kOe every 2kOe on a 4.8 mm wire and a 1.23 mm dot sample using a MicroSense EZ9 VSM. Fourier analysis was used to determine the second harmonics from each torque curve. The biaxial torque curves of the wire samples have a much larger torque amplitude which is mainly due to the crosstalk of the y-coil set. Crosstalk originates from the non-azimuthal symmetric shape of the sample and due to the wobble originating from small sample misalignments on the sample rod. Background can be minimized by using samples with near cylindrical symmetry and using a microscope when mounting the sample on the sample rod.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/adv/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/9.0000770/18703977/015048_1_9.0000770.pdf",""

Thirty Quarter Horse yearlings (374 ± 25 kg BW; 562 ± 16 d of age; 15 fillies and 15 geldings) were used in a 60-d study to test the hypothesis that dietary SCFP (TruEquine C, Diamond V Mills, Inc.) ameliorates joint inflammation following an acute inflammatory insult. Horses were stratified by BW, age, sex, and randomly assigned to dietary treatments (n = 10/treatment): Control (0), 46, or 92 mg/kg BW SCFP. Treatments were top-dressed onto a custom-formulated concentrate void of added microbials offered at 1% BW/d (as-fed) every 12 h. Horses were individually stalled (3.6 m × 7.3 m) and offered ad libitum Coastal bermudagrass hay. Using a free-stall exerciser, horses were exercised following a progressive workload regimen for 30 min/d, 5 d/wk. On d 46, all horses underwent an intra-articular LPS challenge where each horse had one radial carpal joint randomly assigned to receive either 0.8 mL of a 0.5 ng LPS solution or sterile lactated Ringer’s solution (LRS) as a contralateral control. Synovial fluid samples were obtained pre-injection (h 0) and at 6, 12, 24, and 336 h post-injection and analyzed for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a pro-inflammatory prostaglandin via commercial ELISA, and for chemokine-concentration (signaling proteins that direct immune cells; CCL2, and CCL11) and cytokines (inflammatory mediators; TNFα and IL-10) using a multiplex platform via commercial laboratory. Non-normal data (PGE2, IL-10, and CCL2) were log transformed, and all markers were analyzed using MIXED procedure of SAS v9.4. Mean separation was achieved with orthogonal contrasts, and contralateral control carpi were used as a covariate across all hours. There was no effect of SCFP on synovial logPGE2 (P = 0.42), logCCL2 (P = 0.90), CCL11 (P = 0.26), or logIL-10 (P = 0.23). However, there was a treatment × hour interaction for CCL11 (P = 0.04) where the Control had increased concentrations compared with SCFP treatment groups at 6 h post-injection. Furthermore, logIL-10 also had a treatment × hour interaction (P = 0.05) where the 46mg/kg BW group had decreased concentrations at h 12 compared with the Control and 92mg/kg BW group. The main effect of treatment for TNFα (P = 0.04) revealed that the 92mg/kg BW group had less concentrations than the 46mg/kg BW group and tended to have less concentrations than the Control group across all hours. Results indicate that SCFP may help mitigate inflammation markers following an acute intra-articular inflammatory insult.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/102/Supplement_1/19/56821400/skae019.022.pdf",""

However, a better understanding of how psychological closeness to suicide methods is conceptualized by relevant populations is needed to improve its assessment and understand how it may confer risk for suicide. Methods: The goal was to refine the conceptualization of psychological closeness to suicide methods by incorporating feedback from relevant populations. We conducted 30 interviews with those primarily identifying as having lived experience of suicide ( Results: Primary themes included familiarity, comfort, and attachment, with one emerging theme of symbolism.

The hysteresis curves were measured using a MicroSense EZ9 Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM) for 3 different mount orientations of the sample on the sample holder to explore the magnetic anisotropy. The samples printed in zero field exhibited a weak anisotropy with an easy axis perpendicular to the print direction. This anisotropy is caused by the effect of shear flow on the orientation of the magnetic platelets in the 3D printer head. For the MFAAM samples, the S values are largest along the print bed normal. This anisotropy is caused by the field. The alignment of the magnetic particles happens when the molten suspension is in the extruder. When the material is printed, it is folded over on the print bed and its easy axis rotates 90° parallel to the print bed normally. Little realignment of the particles happens after it is printed, suggesting a sharp drop in temperature once the composite touches the print bed, indicating that field-induced effects in the nozzle dominate the anisotropy of MFAAM deposited samples.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/adv/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/9.0000791/19624770/025022_1_9.0000791.pdf",""

This conclusion is consistent with computational work by others which suggest that particle alignment predominantly takes place near the walls of the extruder die where shear flow is maximum. Additional hysteresis curve measurement of the outer cylindrical part of the filament parallel to the r and ϕ directions indicates that the squareness of the hysteresis curve (S) is larger in the r-direction.

The questionnaire developed used model questions from the World Values Survey. Among a total of 38 producer-members of the RPA, 22 (58%) responded to the questionnaire. For the non-member producers, 44 were identified, while 39 (89%) responded to the questionnaire. To assess social trust, the following question was asked: ""Generally speaking, would you say that people can be trusted or that we need to be very careful when dealing with people?"". In AG, 81.8% of the producers responded that we need to be very careful when dealing with other people, and among the NAG producers, 87.2% also agreed with such a statement. Despite the lack of social trust in AG, 77.1% of the members fully or partially trust their association. To assess levels of trust in national institutions by producers, a question was asked as follows: ""To what extent do you trust the institutions listed below?"". For more than 50% of the NAG group, none of the institutions presented deserved full trust, reinforcing the lack of trust, as indicated in the previous question. For those in the NAG group that chose the option ""I trust completely"", the institutions opted were as follows: religious (46.2%), research institutions (43.6%), public universities (38.5%), and rural extension services (33.3%); while those opted as “I do not trust"" were represented by political parties (82.1%), the municipal government (64.1%), and the national congress (61.5%).

Methane mitigation strategies have been widely researched, but most are limited in practical value due to associated diminishments in animal performance. One strategy, dietary supplementation of essential oils, has demonstrated variable reductions in enteric methane production in ruminants. The efficacy of using essential oils to reduce enteric methanogenesis likely varies due to inconsistent concentrations of bioactive components. Therefore, it is justified to investigate the effects of these individual bioactive components on methanogenesis and animal performance. Thymol, a terpene and main bioactive component in many essential oils, has effectively reduced methane production in vitro but in vivo data are limited. The objective of this study was to assess thymol fed at levels that correspond with effective in vitro doses on intake and digestion in beef steers consuming forage. This study was approved by the Texas State University IACUC (#8693). The project was a 4×4 Latin Square where four steers were provided one of four levels of thymol (0, 120, 240, and 480 mg thymol/kg forage intake) soaked on alfalfa cubes fed at 20% of the intake from the previous day, and ad libitum hay and water daily. Periods were 28-d with 8-d to adapt steers to treatments, 5-d to measure intake and digestion, 2-d to collect additional samples (i.e., ruminal microbiome and fat tissues), and a 14-d washout period for thymol depletion from the animal system. Diet, refusal, and fecal samples were analyzed for dry matter, organic matter, and fiber. Acid detergent insoluble ash was used to calculate total fecal production for digestibility estimates. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure in SAS 9.4. There was no effect of thymol dose on forage OMI (4.61 kg/d ± 0.31; P ≥ 0.48), total OMI (5.65 kg/d ± 0.38; P ≥ 0.44), or total digestible OMI (3.18 kg/d ± 0.18; P ≥ 0.26). Further, organic matter and neutral detergent fiber digestibility were not affected by treatment (56.70% ± 2.81, and 63.04% ± 2.49 respectively; P ≥ 0.14). These data indicate that thymol supplementation at doses that suppress in vitro methane production do not negatively impact intake and digestion in beef cattle. Future project activities include whole genome sequencing of rumen microbial communities to evaluate the impact of thymol on populations, with an emphasis on the methanogen archaea. These data have value for establishing a novel methane-mitigating feed additive to lower the carbon footprint of cattle production without sacrificing performance.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/102/Supplement_1/13/56821306/skae019.015.pdf",""

The experiment was replicated over 2 yr, with a total of 180 Angus × Brahman heifers. Each year, 90 heifers were ranked by age (264 ± 1 d) and body weight (BW; 200 ± 2 kg) on d 0, and assigned to a) 1 of 6 drylot pens (10 × 14 m pens; 10 heifers/pen) resulting in a stocking density of 14 m2/heifer (DENS), or b) 1 of 3 paddocks (2-ha paddocks; 10 heifers/paddock) resulting in a stocking density of 2,000 m2/heifer (CON). On d 15, 3 DENS pens were randomly selected and given access to an exercise area (DENS-EX) for 1 h three times weekly. Negligible forage was available for CON heifers, whereas all heifers received the same limit fed diet which averaged 13 kg/heifer daily of a corn-based diet. Heifer shrunk BW was recorded after 16 h of feed and water withdrawal on d -3 and 225 for BW gain calculation. Heifer temperament (chute score, exit velocity, and temperament score) were evaluated on d 0 and 225. Heifers were also fitted on d 0 with a pedometer behind their shoulder and an ear tag (CowManager, Select Sires, Plain City, OH) to record behavioral responses. Each week, pedometer results were recorded, and blood samples were collected for puberty evaluation via plasma progesterone. Heifers from CON had more (P &lt; 0.05) steps per week compared with DENS and DENS-EX (23,973, 6,706, and 12,354 steps/week, respectively; SEM = 1,247), and DENS-EX heifers had more (P &lt; 0.05) steps per week compared with DENS. Heifers from CON spent more (P &lt; 0.05) time ruminating and eating compared with DENS and DENS-EX. No treatment effects (P ≥ 0.91) were detected for heifer BW gain (0.820, 0.815, and 0.824 kg/d for CON, DENS, and DENS-EX, respectively; SEM = 0.016). Heifers from DENS had greater (P ≤ 0.05) exit velocity and temperament score on d 225 compared with DENS-EX and CON. Heifers from DENS experienced delayed puberty attainment (treatment x day; P &lt; 0.01) compared with DENS-EX and CON. A greater (P ≤ 0.05) proportion of CON heifers were pubertal by day 105 compared with DENS and DENS-EX (30.0, 11.6, and 15.0%, respectively; SEM = 6.5), whereas a greater (P &lt; 0.05) proportion of CON and DENS-EX heifers were pubertal by d 154 compared with DENS (61.7, 66.7, and 43.3%, respectively; SEM = 6.5).

Objective: To describe injury and treatment characteristics of middle school–aged athletes receiving care from athletic trainers within the Athletic Training Practice-Based Research Network (AT-PBRN). Design: Descriptive study. Setting: Middle school. Patient or Other Participants: Middle school–aged athletes (n = 1011; male = 503, female = 506, 2 declined to answer) with sports-related musculoskeletal injuries. Main Outcome Measures: Electronic patient records were analyzed from the AT-PBRN from 59 athletic trainers across 14 states between 2010 and 2022. Summary statistics (frequency, percentages, median, and interquartile ranges [IQR]) were used to describe injury (age at injury, sex, sport, body part, and diagnosis) and treatment characteristics (type of treatment, number of visits, and number of procedures per visit). Results: Football (17.7%, n = 179), basketball (17.6%, n = 178), and soccer (14.9%, n = 151) reported the highest number of injuries. The ankle (17.2%, n = 174), knee (16.5%, n = 167), and head (14.1%, n = 143) were the most common injury locations. Concussion (13.0%, n = 131), ankle strain/sprain (12.4%, n = 125), and thigh/hip/groin sprain/strain (11.1%, n = 112) were the most reported diagnoses. Therapeutic exercise or activities (27.6%, n = 1068), athletic trainer evaluation or re-evaluation (24.7%, n = 957), and hot/cold packs (19.8%, n = 766) were the most common services, with a median of 2 visits (IQR = 1 to 4) and 2 procedures (IQR = 1 to 2) per visit. Conclusions: Football, basketball, and soccer reported the most musculoskeletal injuries for middle school-aged athletes. Concussions were the most frequent diagnosis, followed by ankle sprains/strains. Our findings are similar to prior investigations at the high school and collegiate levels. Treatments at the middle school level were also similar to those that have been previously reported at the high school level with therapeutic exercise/activity, athletic trainer evaluation or re-evaluation, and hot/cold packs being the most common treatments. This information may be useful for informing patient care decisions at the middle-school level.","https://meridian.allenpress.com/jat/article-pdf/59/6/649/3390684/i1938-162x-59-6-649.pdf",""

Specifically, it favors short-term homeownership and could substantially penalize homeowners who remain in their principal residence long term. We examine relevant taxation history and the realities that impede tax parity. We suggest modifications that can mitigate tax disparity associated with differences in holding periods and supplement these proposals by addressing tax-reducing provisions that are currently available to all principal residence owners. Our findings highlight a viable step toward mitigating the specific issue related to long-term homeowners as well as stressing that any resulting tax benefits deemed “excessive” for the nation’s wealthiest taxpayers should be dealt with outside of §121.","https://publications.aaahq.org/atajltr/article-pdf/22/1/1/108268/i1543-866x-22-1-1.pdf",""

Materials and Methods: A review of 21 articles focusing on patient co-creation initiatives during the pandemic shows that integrating patient feedback was crucial in transforming care delivery. Results: Joint efforts between healthcare professionals and patients led to new patient-focused telemedicine platforms, more efficient appointment systems, and improved safety measures. These adaptations overcame care barriers and maintained continuity of care. Key themes identified include monitoring community health standards, combining technology with patient–provider communication, and enhancing patient participation in health research. Conclusions: These co-creation efforts not only boosted patient satisfaction and outcomes but also demonstrated the potential for long-term healthcare innovations beyond the pandemic. The review further illuminates that co-creation in healthcare, particularly in tracking community health trends, is a practical strategy that involves diverse stakeholders in shaping healthcare delivery. The widespread adoption of co-creation in outpatient care during the pandemic highlights its role in driving patient-centered behavioral changes through innovative methods like crowdsourcing and dialogue conferencing. The review also recognizes that co-creation has been instrumental in responding to demographic changes, enhancing resources, creativity, and problem-solving in municipal-volunteer collaborations. Additionally, the evolution of technology in patient–provider communication, from initial resistance in the 1990s to its current critical role, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, underscores its importance in enhancing healthcare service delivery and patient data communication. The review also emphasizes the need for ethically and accessibly designed technology, especially for vulnerable groups, and highlights the significance of patient involvement in healthcare research, advocating for user-centered design and shared decision-making to create truly patient-centric interventions.","https://www.mdpi.com/1648-9144/60/1/111/pdf",""

This demand will place additional pressure on livestock systems to increase output while also minimizing natural resource inputs. Insect protein has emerged as a potential environmentally sustainable alternative to conventional protein feeds, such as soybean meal. Further, insect protein does not compete in the human food market as the products of conventional oil crops often do. Mealworm larvae (MWL) has been studied in poultry and swine as an alternative protein feed; however, there is not currently research evaluating MWL for cattle. Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) has also received attention for its potential use in livestock feed due to its scalability and nutritional value, but research in cattle is limited. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of whole dried MWL and defatted BSFL as protein supplements for cattle consuming forage. These procedures were approved by IACUC at Texas State University (#7726). Five ruminally cannulated steers were utilized in a 5×5 Latin square experiment to determine how MWL and BSFL supplementation affect forage utilization. Steers consuming low-quality forage (4.2% crude protein) were provided one of five treatments each period: 1) control with no supplement (CON), 2) soybean meal (CONV), 3) BSFL, 4) MWL, and a 5) 50% BSFL and 50% MWL by-weight (MIX). Supplements were provided at 100 mg N/kg BW. Periods included 8-d for treatment adaptation, 5-d for intake and digestion measurements, and 1-d for ruminal fermentation measures. Dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), CP, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) were determined for diet, ort, and feces. Protein supplementation stimulated forage OM intake (P ≤ 0.01) relative to CON. There was a significant difference in FOMI (P ≤ 0.01) between BSFL and CONV. Steers receiving CONV treatment consumed 4.71 kg FOMI/d, which was significantly greater (P ≤ 0.01) than those receiving BSFL (4.30 kg/d). There were not differences in FOMI between other treatment groups. Total digestible OM intake (TDOMI) was stimulated by protein supplementation (P ≤ 0.01) from 1.94 kg/d for CON to an average of 3.24 kg/d across protein supplements. Organic matter digestibility (OMD) and neutral detergent fiber digestibility (NDFD) were not affected by treatment (P ≥ 0.37), for an average OMD of 66.5% and NDFD of 62.7%. There was also not a treatment effect (P = 0.96) on total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations, although there were some shifts in molar proportions of individual VFAs across treatments. These data indicate that MWL may be more efficacious than BSFL in stimulating forage utilization in beef cattle, but both are viable protein supplements.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/102/Supplement_1/14/56821325/skae019.016.pdf",""

The corresponding amide, CAPA, has improved metabolic stability but limited anticancer activity relative to CAPE. We report the synthesis using flow and on-water Wittig reaction approaches of five previously reported and five novel CAPA analogues. All of these analogues lack the reactive catechol functionality of CAPA and CAPE. Cytotoxicity studies of CAPE, CAPA, and these CAPA analogues in HeLa and BE(2)-C cells were carried out. Surprisingly, we found that CAPA is cytotoxic against the neuroblastoma BE(2)-C cell line (IC50 = 12 µM), in contrast to the weak activity of CAPA against HeLa cells (IC50 = 112 µM), and the literature reports of the absence of activity for CAPA against a variety of other cancer cell lines. One novel CAPA analogue, 3f, was identified as having cytotoxic activity similar to CAPE in HeLa cells (IC50 = 63 µM for 3f vs. 32 µM for CAPE), albeit with lower activity against BE(2)-C cells (IC50 = 91 µM) than CAPA. A different CAPA analogue, 3g, was found to have similar effects against BE(2)-C cells (IC50 = 92 µM).

Night shift work is a well-established factor contributing to disrupted and insufficient sleep, which is linked to heightened inflammation. This study aimed to assess the impact of night shift frequency and sleep duration on inflammatory biomarkers in a sample of nurses. Methods: As part of a larger longitudinal study, 392 nurses (mean age = 39.54 years, 92% female; 23% night shift-working) completed daily sleep diaries and wore an actigraphy watch for 7 days. On day 7, nurses had blood drawn to measure inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β). Mediation analyses were conducted to examine the mediating role of sleep duration on the links between night shifts worked in the past 7 days and inflammatory markers on day 7. Results: Sleep duration did not mediate the effect of night shift work on inflammatory biomarkers. However, there were several significant direct effects. More night shifts worked was associated with lower actigraphy-measured sleep duration (b = -0.16, p &lt; 0.001) and greater IL-6 (b = 0.03, p = 0.002). Similarly, more night shifts worked (b = 0.03, p = 0.003) and lower self-reported sleep time (b = -0.19, p &lt; 0.001) were independently linked to greater IL-6. Fewer night shifts worked (b = -0.05, p = 0.02) and lower self-reported sleep duration (b = -0.19, p &lt; 0.001) were associated with higher IL-1β. Conclusion: Given the critical role that nurses play in the healthcare system, it is important to understand the potentially modifiable factors impacting their health and well-being. This study demonstrated that short sleep duration may explain how night shift work impacts physiological dysregulation in nurses, including elevated systemic inflammation. Promoting adequate sleep opportunity in shift workers may be a way to improve their long-term health outcomes, although additional future experimental work on this topic is needed.

The study comprises three main components: identification of data quality check indexes; establishment of data quality thresholds; and implementation of data quality check procedures. Annual pavement rating data collected by a vendor using automated technologies and manual audit data from an independent third party were utilized to develop thresholds and test the procedures. Three districts, including two urban and one rural districts in Texas, were selected for the data quality check implementation. The results indicate that the proposed procedures, along with defined indexes and thresholds, efficiently identify pavements with data quality issues at both the section level and the county level. By pinpointing problematic areas, highway agencies can allocate resources for quick quality checks, enhancing the accuracy and precision of automated pavement condition data. The study can help highway agencies enhance the accuracy and precision of automated pavement condition data, ultimately leading to improvements in their pavement conditions.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/03611981241246247",""

When wildfires occur close to wine grape (<italic>Vitis vinifera</italic>) production areas, smoke-derived volatile phenolic compounds make their way into the grape berries, negatively affecting the flavor and aroma profile of the resulting wine and compromising the production value of entire vineyards. Evidence for the permeation of smoke-associated compounds into grape berries has been provided through metabolomics; however, the basis for grapevines’ response to smoke at the gene expression level has not been investigated in detail. To address this knowledge gap, we employed time-course RNA sequencing to observe gene expression-level changes in grape berries in response to smoke exposure. Significant increases in gene expression (and enrichment of gene ontologies) associated with detoxification of reactive compounds, cell wall fortification, and vacuolar activity was observed in response to smoke. These findings suggest that the accumulation of volatile phenols from smoke exposure activates redox stress pathways and detoxification mechanisms that render smoke-derived compounds less reactive.

Yet, racial disparities exist in which students are most likely to be placed into developmental education. The present study investigates how multiple measures of students’ mathematics background ameliorate racial disparities in developmental math outcomes among U.S. community college students. Methods: The High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 was used to identify sample participants ( n = 3,650) who attended a 2-year postsecondary institution (community college) within 3 years of high school graduation. A series of logistic regression models were employed with developmental math outcomes as dependent variables predicted by multiple measures of student’s math background and demographic covariates. Results: Compared to White students, Black and Hispanic students had poorer developmental math outcomes; however, inclusion of multiple measures of high school math experiences reduced racial disparities. Multiple measures significantly reduced developmental math enrollment by 13% for Black students and 15% for Hispanic students, improved developmental math passing rates for Black students by 25% and Hispanic students by 25%, and improved passing rates for the first college-credit bearing math course for Hispanic students by 73%. Conclusion: The present study highlights how multiple measures of students’ math background might be an important lever for more racially-equitable placement processes. For Black and Hispanic students, the most influential high school measures were high school math GPA, highest high school math course, and math motivation. More work is needed to fine-tune how multiple measures can be used to increase access and equitable outcomes for students.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/00915521241259168",""

Like other storage systems, UHS is still in its infancy, with limited experiments characterizing the multiphase flow of hydrogen in aquifers. These flows are described using saturation functions (curves in reservoir simulation representing the relationship between relative permeability and capillary pressure). Given the periodic injection and production of hydrogen, saturation functions don't rely solely on current saturation; they also consider the path or history the saturation has taken, facilitating transitions between drainage and imbibition also known as hysteresis. Recent publications underscore the significant influence of hysteresis on recovery factors, and neglecting these effects can introduce substantial uncertainties in cumulative hydrogen recovery.","https://onepetro.org/IPTCONF/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2523/IPTC-24044-MS/3368738/iptc-24044-ms.pdf",""

The interplay between human and natural systems renders management a complex problem that must be addressed by decision-makers. Perceptions of invasive species issues varies depending on an individual’s access to information. Although invasive species and their management are often discussed in formal higher education, not all members of the population have access to a formal educational setting. Informal educational experiences may be a mechanism to reach out to community members in a more accessible and perhaps engaging way than traditional higher education classroom experiences. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of an informal, place-based educational program on perceptions and knowledge of invasive species and their management within the community. Place-based education is a pedagogy connection local places with intimate knowledge of the systems, processes, and outcomes that give it meaning to human and non-human species. First, we organized and administered short walks in two central Texas, USA, parks with conversational lessons and hands-on learning experiences. Second, we administered a follow-up retrospective-reflective survey to measure participants’ knowledge and perceptions of invasive species management and postwalk/lesson changes in them. We also compared between the treatment group of participants versus a control group within the community who did not participate in the informal lessons. Fifty-two people participated in both the educational program walks and testing over the course of 1 year, and 63 people were included in the follow-up retrospective-reflective survey control group. Results indicate a statistically significant positive change in knowledge and perception categories within the treatment group. Post hoc results indicate a positive change in knowledge and perceptions in our sample as a function of treatment group members’ age and income, respectively. The methodology used in this study was simple and inexpensive. Hence, our approach could be easily replicated in other areas to educate community members.","https://journals.ashs.org/downloadpdf/journals/horttech/34/1/article-p71.xml",""

We assessed the role that the live‐bait industry has in facilitating the introduction of nonnative and invasive species into Texas rivers. We focused on two invasive cyprinodontid species, the Sheepshead Minnow Methods: We conducted telephone and in‐person surveys of live‐bait shops in Texas on a seasonal basis (summer, fall, winter, spring) for 1 year.

With the number of available test kits surpassing the count of positive/probable cases, there is a pressing need to develop a robust and lightweight classifier model to alleviate the burden of physical testing kits and expedite the detection process. The existing state-of-the-art primarily focuses on achieving high accuracy in modeling Mpox without considering factors such as modeling suitability, real-time inferencing, and adaptability to resource-constrained CPU-only mobile devices. In this research, we propose a novel lightweight binarized DarkNet53 model, referred to as BinaryDNet53, which is approximately ∼ 20× more computationally efficient and ∼ 2× more power-efficient than the current state-of-the-art. This model demonstrates smooth detection capabilities when deployed on small hand-held or embedded devices. Our work introduces large-margin feature learning and weighted loss calculation to enhance results, particularly on complex samples. We conduct experiments using the latest MSLD v2.0 dataset, showcasing the superiority of the proposed model over state-of-the-art models based on classification and computational metrics, including Watt power consumption, required memory, and GFLOPS.","",""

The forensic examination of these applications emerges as a pivotal avenue for uncovering valuable insights into criminal behavior and identifying suspects. Discord, a social media platform, has become a significant focal point for such illicit activities. In this paper, we examine the remnants of Discord on both Windows and Linux operating systems, employing storage, memory, and network analysis techniques to review the remnants of Discord. Our investigation reveals a range of crucial artifacts that have been successfully recovered across all three areas of analysis, including login and payment details, chat history, account information, and much more.

Therefore, measuring SOM content is a fundamental practice in soil science and agricultural research. The traditional approach (oven-dry) of measuring SOM is a costly, arduous, and time-consuming process. However, the integration of cutting-edge technology can significantly aid in the prediction of SOM, presenting a promising alternative to traditional methods. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that an accurate estimate of SOM might be obtained by combining the ground-based sensor-captured soil parameters and soil analysis data along with drone images of the farm. The data are gathered using three different methods: ground-based sensors detect soil parameters such as temperature, pH, humidity, nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium of the soil; aerial photos taken by UAVs display the vegetative index (NDVI); and the Haney test of soil analysis reports measured in a lab from collected samples. Our datasets combined the soil parameters collected using ground-based sensors, soil analysis reports, and NDVI content of farms to perform the data analysis to predict SOM using different machine learning algorithms. We incorporated regression and ANOVA for analyzing the dataset and explored seven different machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, Ridge regression, Lasso regression, random forest regression, Elastic Net regression, support vector machine, and Stochastic Gradient Descent regression to predict the soil organic matter content using other parameters as predictors.","https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/7/2357/pdf",""

However, extracting IBIs from noisy signals is challenging since the morphology of the signal gets distorted in the presence of noise. Electrocardiogram (ECG) of a person in heavy motion is highly corrupted with noise, known as motion-artifact, and IBI extracted from it is inaccurate. As a part of remote health monitoring and wearable system development, denoising ECG signals and estimating IBIs correctly from them have become an emerging topic among signal-processing researchers. Apart from conventional methods, deep-learning techniques have been successfully used in signal denoising recently, and diagnosis process has become easier, leading to accuracy levels that were previously unachievable. We propose a deep-learning approach leveraging tiramisu autoencoder model to suppress motion-artifact noise and make the R-peaks of the ECG signal prominent even in the presence of high-intensity motion. After denoising, IBIs are estimated more accurately expediting diagnosis tasks. Results illustrate that our method enables IBI estimation from noisy ECG signals with SNR up to -30 dB with average root mean square error (RMSE) of 13 milliseconds for estimated IBIs. At this noise level, our error percentage remains below 8% and outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3616020",""

This study proposes the use of representative geological realizations (RGRs) as an efficient approach to capture the uncertainty range of the full set while reducing computational costs. A predetermined number of RGRs is selected using an integrated unsupervised machine learning (UML) framework, which includes Euclidean distance measurement, multidimensional scaling (MDS), and a deterministic K-means (DK-means) clustering algorithm. In the context of the intricate 3D aquifer CO2 storage model, PUNQ-S3, these algorithms are utilized. The UML methodology selects five RGRs from a pool of 25 possibilities (20% of the total), taking into account the reservoir quality index (RQI) as a static parameter of the reservoir. To determine the credibility of these RGRs, their simulation results are scrutinized through the application of the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test, which analyzes the distribution of the output. In this assessment, 40 CO2 injection wells cover the entire reservoir alongside the full set. The end-point simulation results indicate that the CO2 structural, residual, and solubility trapping within the RGRs and full set follow the same distribution. Simulating five RGRs alongside the full set of 25 GRs over 200 years, involving 10 years of CO2 injection, reveals consistently similar trapping distribution patterns, with an average value of Dmax of 0.21 remaining lower than Dcritical (0.66).

Low-energy (i.e., non-air conditioning) cooling modalities may attenuate increases in core temperature in burn survivors, but this question has not been examined. Thus, the purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that low-energy cooling modalities will attenuate increases in core temperature during physical activity in the heat in well-healed burn survivors. Methods: Adults with no burn injuries (non-burned; n=10), 20-40% body surface area severely burned (n=11), and &gt;40% body surface area severely burned (n=10) walked on a treadmill for 1 hour at a low intensity (2.5 ± 0.2 mph and 2% grade) in a warm environmental chamber (39°C, 40% relative humidity). Burn survivors were at least 2 years post-injury. Testing was performed on four occasions, with the following cooling modalities applied throughout each trial (random trial order): no cooling, fan at 4 m/s (FAN), 10-50 g of water sprayed every 5 min (Water Spray; scaled to burn area size), or a combination of Water Spray+FAN. Rectal or gastrointestinal temperature (Tcore) was recorded throughout each trial. Results: None of the cooling modalities affected Tcore for the non-burned (p=0.61) or the 20-40% burn (p=0.45) groups. Moreover, FAN and Water Spray+FAN did not impact end-exercise Tcore for the &gt;40% burn group (p≥0.48). However, in the &gt;40% burn group Water Spray reduced end-exercise Tcore by 0.34°C (0.12 to 0.56°C) when compared with no cooling (p = 0.004). Conclusions: At the assessed workload and environmental condition, the efficacy of the applied cooling modalities on Tcore responses of burn survivors is dependent on both the selected modality and the size of the burn injury. Namely, there was no evidence that FAN or Water Spray+FAN attenuated Tcore responses regardless of the burn size, while Water Spray was effective at attenuating the elevation in Tcore in those with &gt;40% burn injuries. Applicability of Research to Practice: These data demonstrate that skin wetting, via frequent water spraying, is effective in attenuating elevations in Tcore during physical activity in warm and humid conditions in individuals with large burn injuries. Thus, water spray may be useful to encourage such burn survivors to engage in physical activity that is beneficial for their full rehabilitation as well as cardio-metabolic health.","https://academic.oup.com/jbcr/article-pdf/45/Supplement_1/4/57260337/irae036.005.pdf",""

These alloys are known for their counterintuitive reduction in the bandgap when adding the smaller atom, due to a band anticrossing (BAC) or splitting of the conduction band. Surprisingly, the existence of band splitting was found to be completely unrelated to the local displacement of the lattice ions near the mismatched atom. Furthermore, in BGaAs, the reduction in the bandgap due to BAC was weaker than the increase due to the lattice constant, which has not been observed among other HMAs but may explain differences among experimental reports. While local distortion in GeC and GaNAs was not the cause for BAC, it was found to enhance the bandgap reduction due to BAC. This work also found that mere contrast in electronegativity between neighboring atoms does not induce BAC. In fact, surrounding the electronegative atom with elements of even smaller electronegativity than the host (e.g., Sn or In) consistently decreased or even eliminated BAC. For a fixed composition, moving Sn toward C and In toward either N or B was always energetically favorable and increased the bandgap, consistent with experimental annealing results. Such rearrangement also delocalized the conduction band wavefunctions near the mismatched atom to resemble the original host states in unperturbed Ge or GaAs, causing the BAC to progressively weaken. These collective results were consistent whether the mismatched atom was a cation (N), anion (B), or fully covalent (C), varying only with the magnitude of its electronegativity, with B having the least effect. The effects can be explained by charge screening of the mismatched atom's deep electrostatic potential. Together, these results help explain differences in the bandgap and other properties reported for HMAs from different groups and provide insight into the creation of materials with designer properties.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/5.0179255/19797197/113101_1_5.0179255.pdf",""

Previously, we have demonstrated that a combination of vitamin D3 (VD) and fructooligosaccharides (FOSs) upregulates colonic Vdr in mice. Here, we aim to examine the effect of VD, alone or in combination with FOSs, on intestinal barrier integrity and the secretion of antimicrobial peptides, as well as the gut microbial community. Male and female C57BL/6J mice at 6 weeks old were randomized into three groups to receive the following dietary regimens (n = 10/sex/group) for 8 weeks: (1) standard AIN-93G control diet (CTR), (2) CTR + 5000 IU vitamin D3 (VD), and (3) VD + 5% fructooligosaccharides (VF). VD and VF differentially regulated the mRNA expressions of tight junction proteins in the colon and ileum. VF suppressed the upregulation of colonic ZO-1 and occludin, which was induced by VD supplementation alone. In the ileum, occludin but not ZO-1 was upregulated 20-fold in the VF-treated mice. While VD did not alter the mRNA expressions of Vdr and defensins in the ileum, these targets were downregulated by VF. Microbial analysis further reveals a shift of microbial beta diversity and a reduction in Romboutsia ilealis, a pathobiont, in VF-treated mice. Though the implications of these phenotypical and microbial changes remain to be determined, the administration of FOSs in the presence of VD may serve as an effective dietary intervention for maintaining intestinal homeostasis.","https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/14/2236/pdf",""

TLA-modified binders demonstrate superior rheological properties, including improved Jnr and percentage recovery, indicating enhanced resistance to permanent deformation and reduced fatigue cracking. However, an increase in TLA content correlates with higher G*·sin δ values, suggesting a trade-off with fatigue resistance and a higher susceptibility to cracking. Additionally, while TLA initially improves binder flexibility at low temperatures, excessive content can increase stiffness, adversely affecting stress relaxation properties. Notably, TLA enhances storage stability, ensuring minimal phase separation and excellent homogeneity. These insights underscore the need for the precise control of TLA content to optimize pavement durability.

The wide variation in human body mass presents an opportunity to explore the relationship between mechanical load and skeletal response in weight‐bearing elements. Here, we examine variation in femoral macroscopic morphology as a function of body mass index (BMI), which is used as a metric of load history. A sample of 80 femora (40 female; 40 male) from recent modern humans was selected from the Texas State University Donated Skeletal Collection. Femora were imaged using x‐ray computed tomography (voxel size ~0.5 mm), and segmented to produce surface models. Landmark‐based geometric morphometric analyses based on the Coherent Point Drift algorithm were conducted to quantify shape. Principal components analyses were used to summarize shape variation, and component scores were regressed on BMI. Within the male sample, increased BMI was associated with a mediolaterally expanded femoral shaft, as well as increased neck‐shaft angle and decreased femoral neck anteversion angle. No statistically significant relationships between shape and BMI were found in the female sample. While mechanical stimulus has traditionally been applied to changes in long bong diaphyseal shape it appears that bone functional adaptation may also result in fundamental changes in the shape of skeletal elements.","https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/am-pdf/10.1002/ar.25397",""

TLRs are pattern recognition receptors used by the innate immune system to regulate inflammation, infections, and to indicate the presence of pathogenic activity within a tissue. Recent studies have identified several TLRs present in pigs that can detect a variety of molecules. Previous data from our group has demonstrated shifts in bacterial communities within the uterus during early gestation in gilts. Therefore, the objective of this study was to quantify and compare expression of TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR6 in endometria of gilts. These TLRs were chosen because they are located on the cell surface and recognize invading microbes. Crossbred gilts (n = 21) free of physical, health or reproductive-related issues were euthanized and hysterectomized during the preimplantation (d 11) and peri-implantation (d 15) stages of pregnancy (Pregnant d 11, n = 10; Pregnant d 15, n = 11). Samples of endometrial mucosa were collected and snap-frozen in sterile 1.5 mL tubes and stored at -80°C until analyzed. The mean relative expression of TLR-1, TLR-2, TLR-4, TLR-5, and TLR-6 mRNAs were quantified by RT-qPCR. Statistical analysis was completed using one-way ANOVA and student’s t-test for pairwise comparison in JMP 17.0 (SAS Institute; Cary, NC). All TLRs were expressed in the endometrium. Expression of TLR-4 was greater on d 11 than d 15 (1.39 ± 0.14 vs. 0.45 ± 0.13, respectively; P &lt; 0.01), and there was a trend for expression of TLR-2 to be greater on d 11 than d 15 (1.89 ± 0.37 vs. 0.90 ± 0.35, respectively; 0.05 &lt; P &lt; 0.1). Expression of TLR2, TLR5, and TLR6 did not differ between d 11 and d 15 (P &gt; 0.05). The results indicate that TLRs are not only expressed in the porcine endometrium, but they differ in expression during early gestation. Conceptus signaling and inflammation during elongation and implantation and/ or shifts in bacterial communities within the uterus may be responsible. Additionally, future work examining bacterial shifts and TLR expression during mid and late gestation may offer further insight.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/102/Supplement_2/330/57403439/skae102.377.pdf",""

Therefore, humane alternatives must be investigated. Male beef calves (n = 81) were stratified by weaning weight and allocated to 1 of 8 pens. Pens were assigned randomly to treatment: 1) banded (B; n = 42) or 2) a 1 mL intratesticular Zn (100 mg Zn) injection (Z; n = 39). Two pens from each treatment were selected for blood collection (B, n = 22; Z, n = 19); the alternative pens were assigned to behavior measurements (5 calves/pen; B, n = 10; Z, n = 10). Behavior data were collected for 1 wk post-castration using accelerometers (HOBOware Lite software). Blood was collected daily on d 0 through d 7 post-castration, and every 28 d for the remainder of the backgrounding phase for complete blood cell counts, serum haptoglobin (Hp), and serum testosterone. Testicular width and BW were also measured. All blood and growth parameters were analyzed using the MIXED procedures of SAS while GLIMMIX was used for behavioral analysis. Body weights did not differ due to treatment throughout the 140-d backgrounding phase (P ≥ 0.39). Overall ADG was greater for Z calves compared with B calves (P = 0.05). Serum testosterone concentrations were greater in Z calves compared with B calves throughout the 140-d trial (P ≤ 0.02). Testicular width in Z calves peaked numerically on d 3 and declined to baseline measurements by d 113 (P = 0.67). Intratesticular Zn castrated calves spent more time lying flat on their side compared with B calves 1 d post-castration (P = 0.03) until d 3 and 4 where B calves spent more time lying on their side compared with Z calves (P ≤ 0.02). Banded calves spent more time standing the first 2 d post-castration compared with Z calves (P ≤ 0.01). On d 3, 4, 5, and 6, Z calves spent more time standing (P ≤ 0.01) while B calves spent more time laying on their sternum (P ≤ 0.03). Banded calves had decreased Hp concentrations on d 1, 2, 3, 7, and 28 compared with Z calves (P ≤ 0.01). Total white blood cell concentrations, both proportion and concentration of neutrophils, and proportion of lymphocytes were greater in Z calves compared with B calves on d 1, 2, and 3 (P ≤ 0.01). Although growth performance was not hindered by the Zn intratesticular injection castration method, it did cause behaviors indicative of pain and resulted in an acute inflammatory and immune response compared with banded calves. Therefore, castrating with an intratesticular injection of Zn may not be a sufficient alternative to conventional methods.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/102/Supplement_1/66/56821282/skae019.078.pdf",""

Anthropogenic noise induces behavioral and physiological reactions across a range of taxa and increased traffic noise affects glucocorticoid (GC) hormones associated with the stress response in amphibians. GCs help to maintain homeostasis while balancing energetic trade-offs between reproduction, growth, and activity. Stressors during early development can impact fitness at later life stages. We measured growth, activity, and GCs in response to high levels of traffic noise in two tadpole species that differ in life history: Acris crepitans and Rana berlandieri. We predicted that earlier exposures to traffic noise will slow down the development and alter the behavior and GC concentrations differently than later exposures. Subjects were initially either exposed to natural levels of traffic noise for 8 days (early exposure) or a white noise control (later exposure), then the treatment was switched. Activity was measured via focal sampling and tadpoles were categorized as active if movement was detected. Tadpoles exposed to white noise initially maintained mass and activity throughout the experiment and early exposure to traffic noise had a greater impact on mass, activity, and GCs. Tadpoles exposed to traffic noise initially lost mass, with A. crepitans regaining mass but not R. berlandieri. When exposed earlier to traffic noise, R. berlandieri increased movement when shifted to the white noise treatment while A. crepitans did not significantly change activity. Acris creptians had higher corticosterone release rates compared to R. berlandieri, and in both species, release rates were higher for tadpoles exposed to noise earlier. The longer-lived R. berlandieri allocated more of their energetic resources into activity, while the shorter-lived A. crepitans allocated energy toward growth. Rana berlandieri and A. crepitans utilized different coping strategies to contend with early exposure to traffic noise, potentially due to differences in life histories. Our findings suggest that these tadpoles employ different coping mechanisms to modulate stress responses in noise-polluted environments, and these mechanisms could influence their fitness later in life. Further study is needed to understand the impact in more sensitive tadpole species.","https://academic.oup.com/icb/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/icb/icae032/57836971/icae032.pdf",""

In the present paper, we provide an overview of the strengths and weaknesses of several commonly employed measures, including official statistics, victimization surveys, self‐report surveys, and (quasi)experimental measures. Drawing insights from this review, we then introduce a novel behavioral measure: the donation method. Although the task was originally designed to examine behaviors of interest to behavioral economists, we carefully outline strategies to refine and implement the donation method to assess white collar crime, addressing challenges such as task suitability and controlling for respondent behavior. Additionally, we provide a sample task to illustrate how such a tool could be used within this field. We conclude by underlining the appeal of adopting innovative measurement tools like the donation method to advance our collective understanding of white collar crime. By advocating for its widespread adoption and providing guidance for its use, we endeavor to catalyze progress in the field, facilitating unique insights and, potentially, more efficacious strategies for confronting and surmounting the methodological obstacles inherent in studying this elusive form of criminal activity.","",""

Identifying normative values before implementing a MSK screen is essential in contributing to athlete performance and injury risk profiles. Objective:: To review upper extremity MSK data in healthy tennis players across age, sex, and level of play. Data Source:: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed for this review. A search was conducted in MEDLINE, SPORTDiscus, Embase, and CINAHL. Study Selection:: This review included shoulder, elbow, and wrist ROM, isometric strength, or isokinetic strength in a tennis population. Each article was critically appraised to help identify the internal and external validity of each study. Study Design:: Systematic review. Level of Evidence:: Level 3. Data Extraction:: A total of 41 studies met the search criteria. Each contributor organized the data elements of interest into data tables, with a second contributor assigned for review. Data elements of interest included player and study characteristics: ROM, isometric dynamometry, and isokinetic strength. Results:: A total of 3174 players were included in the final studies. Most of the players included were competitive adolescents and young adults; 15 studies included ROM data. Male tennis players consistently had more external rotation (ER) gain (range, 1.8º to 8.8º) and internal rotation (IR) loss (range, -15.3º to -3.0º) when compared with their female counterparts (ER range, -2.5º to 5.8º; IR range, -10.4º to -3º). Shoulder IR and ER strength were measured in the majority of all the strength studies, with the external rotators generating at least two-thirds the strength of the internal rotators. Conclusion:: Overall MSK data of tennis players indicate that shoulder strength values are often larger than nontennis players, but equal to or slightly lower than comparable athletes in other overhead sports. Adaptive changes of the glenohumeral joint and subsequent rotational motion are similar to those of other overhead athletes.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/19417381231223540",""

However, the comprehensive use of various modifiers is limited due to storage stability issues. Moreover, there is a scarcity of detailed analyses regarding the degree of separation for asphalt binders among each method despite the utilization of various methods to assess the storage stability of binders. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis was conducted to assess the storage stability of asphalt binder modified with a crumb rubber modifier (CRM) and styrene–isoprene–styrene (SIS), utilizing five evaluation factors following the ASTM D7173 guidelines based on four mixing methods (A: high-shear mixing method, B: low-speed agitating method, C: high-shear mixing method + low mixing method, D: low-speed agitating method + low mixing method). To produce the modified asphalt binder, the proportions of the CRM were 5% and 10% for each binder, and 10% SIS was added to all binders. The results in this study convey that (1) the addition of the modifier led to an increase in G*/sin δ with different mixing methods, but using mixing methods (C and D) for a relatively long time resulted in a lower G*/sin δ, indicating suboptimal performance; (2) through the multiple stress creep recovery (MSCR), rheological properties of Jnr and % rec exhibited trends similar to G*/sin δ evaluation, highlighting an improved elastic recovery with a higher modifier content; (3) storage stability assessment revealed consistent trends in high-shear mixing groups (A and C), while low-speed mixing groups (B and D) exhibited an elevated separation index (SI), suggesting a sensitivity to modification conditions; (4) evaluation using the MSCR method indicated that % rec with a 3.2 kPa load is effective for the sensitive assessment of binder storage stability and Jnr showed a limited sensitivity across varying loads, advocating for % rec for precise evaluation; and (5) despite permitting various tests, achieving consistent results remains challenging. Future research should explore diverse modifiers and optimal evaluation methods to enhance knowledge of binder behavior and separation dynamics.","https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/9/2091/pdf",""

Key to this process is genuine and honest communication. However, much previous research suggests that clients are not always fully truthful with their therapists. In this study, we make a preliminary examination of the relationship between client deception in therapy, the quality of the therapeutic relationship and therapeutic outcomes. Methods: Participants who had been involved in psychotherapy completed a variety of measures that assessed their use of dishonesty in therapy. They also completed measures of the quality of the client–therapist relationship and measures of their perceived therapeutic outcomes. We hypothesised that client dishonesty would negatively correlate with the perceived quality of the therapeutic relationship and the therapeutic outcomes. Furthermore, we predicted that the quality of the therapeutic relationship would mediate the relationship between client dishonesty and perceived therapeutic outcomes. Results: The results of correlation and mediation analyses supported these hypotheses. Client dishonesty was associated with poorer therapeutic relationships and worse perceived therapeutic outcomes. Additionally, therapeutic relationship quality partially mediated the relationship between client dishonesty and therapeutic outcomes.

Methods: We tested for predictors of effort density and catch rate while building generalized additive models with responses derived from a long‐term creel data set and explanatory variables derived from the season of the creel survey, geoposition of the reservoir, and water level data obtained from the Texas Water Development Board. Result: Season significantly affected models, with strong positive effects on catch rates during the spring and fall and strong positive effects on effort densities during the spring. Spatially, the strongest positive effects were observed for catch rates in the southern and eastern portions of the state and for effort densities in the northern and western portions of the state. Quarterly (i.e., 3 months) fluctuations in water level were identified as environmental drivers of catch rates and effort density during the springtime. Percent full (i.e., surface area relative to full pool) was also identified as a significant predictor, with increasing effort densities and catch rates at higher levels of percent full. Conclusion: Our study provides a comparative baseline for future evaluations of black bass fisheries in Texas and a depiction of key factors influencing black bass angler catch rates and effort densities using a modeling approach that may be applied within a variety of fisheries research applications.","https://afspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/nafm.10963",""

An accelerated stability study was performed on 17 fentanyl analogs (fentalogs) over a wide range of pH (2–10) and temperature (20–60°C) conditions over 24 h. Dilute aqueous systems were used to investigate temperature and pH‐dependent kinetics using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). Liquid chromatography‐quadrupole/time‐of‐flight‐mass spectrometry (LC‐Q/TOF–MS) was used for structural elucidation of degradants. With the exception of remifentanil, all fentalogs evaluated were stable at pH 6 or lower. Fentalogs were generally unstable in strongly alkaline environments and at elevated temperatures. Remifentanil was the least stable drug and N‐dealkylated fentalogs were the most stable. Fentanyl degraded to acetylfentanyl, norfentanyl, fentanyl N‐oxide, and 1‐phenethylpyridinium salt (1‐PEP). A total of 26 unique breakdown products were observed for 15 of the fentanyl derivatives studied. Common degradation pathways involved N‐dealkylation, oxidation of the piperidine nitrogen, and β‐elimination of N‐phenylpropanamide followed by oxidation/dehydration of the piperidine ring.

However, notable limitations exist across past studies, including the heavy use of between-person analyses that are often based on single time point measures, use of general “sleep disturbance” over well-defined facets of sleep, overreliance on self-reported sleep, and lack of attention to within-person effects and their interactions with group-level characteristics (e.g., shiftwork). To address these limitations, the current study examined relationships between daily sleep facets and depression in nurses across measurements (self-report, actigraphy) and moderators (shiftwork, intraindividual variability of sleep midpoint). Methods: Participants were 349 nurses (90.83% female; 76.50% White; 89.20% non-Latinx; Mage = 39.13 years) who wore an Actiwatch and completed the Consensus Sleep Diary and Patient Health Questionnaire-2 for 14 days. Multilevel models examined the bidirectional associations between daily depression and sleep (i.e., sleep efficiency [SE], quality [SQ], duration, midpoint) across self-report and actigraphy measures. Shiftwork (day vs. night shift worker) and intraindividual standard deviation (iSD) of sleep midpoint were included as moderators in models. Results: Daily depression and subjective SQ and SE were bidirectionally associated after covarying for gender, age, race, and ethnicity. On days when nurses experienced higher depression than their average, they experienced worse subjective SQ (b = -0.10, SE = 0.02, p &lt; .001) and SE (b = -0.47, SE = 0.18, p = .008) on the same day. In turn, when nurses experienced worse subjective SQ (b = -0.07, SE = 0.02, p &lt; .001) and SE (b = -0.01, SE = 0.00, p = .012) than their average, they experienced higher depression on the next day. Daily actigraphy-based sleep facets were not significantly associated with depression. Neither shiftwork nor iSD of sleep midpoint were significant moderators. Conclusion: Results reveal bidirectional, daily associations between subjective, but not actigraphy-based, sleep and depression. This suggests one's perception of sleep may be more influential on and impacted by depression than how one more objectively slept. Intensive longitudinal approaches to understanding sleep and depression should continue to be utilized to allow for the establishment of temporal precedence and bidirectionality across granular time scales.

Addressing these concerns, we introduce BioDiffusion, a diffusion-based probabilistic model optimized for the synthesis of multivariate biomedical signals. BioDiffusion demonstrates excellence in producing high-fidelity, non-stationary, multivariate signals for a range of tasks including unconditional, label-conditional, and signal-conditional generation. Leveraging these synthesized signals offers a notable solution to the aforementioned challenges. Our research encompasses both qualitative and quantitative assessments of the synthesized data quality, underscoring its capacity to bolster accuracy in machine learning tasks tied to biomedical signals. Furthermore, when juxtaposed with current leading time-series generative models, empirical evidence suggests that BioDiffusion outperforms them in biomedical signal generation quality.","https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5354/11/4/299/pdf",""

A health care provider's lack of knowledge in LGBTQ+ health needs, low confidence in discussing sexuality, and bias can result in LGBTQ+ patients choosing to delay or avoid seeking care. These are missed opportunities for health care providers to recognize their unique needs, provide education and preventive screenings and care, and manage chronic conditions. Purpose:: The aim of this study was to examine nurse practitioner students' perceptions of knowledge, confidence, and experiences related to caring for LGBTQ+ patients. Methodology:: Using a descriptive, cross-sectional survey research design, a 29-item online survey was distributed through email to nurse practitioner students ( Results:: Overall, nurse practitioners (NP) students demonstrated infrequent questioning related to gender preferences, sexual terms, and clarification of relationships. Results showed that 77.9% of NP students within two terms of graduation had not received any LGBTQ+-specific training. Almost 75% of the NP students reported not routinely asking about sexuality, and 82% reported infrequently or never asking gender identity. Furthermore, 93.1% of respondents reported providers infrequently or never ask about preferred gender or pronouns, and 86% reported providers infrequently inquire about sexual identity in primary care visits. Conclusions:: Study findings demonstrate the uniqueness of managing care for LGBTQ+ patients and importance for more detailed LGBTQ+ health training in curricula in NP programs. Implications:: Closing the gap in health care for LGBTQ+ patients is paramount in addressing global health disparities and population care.","https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/JXX.0000000000001043",""

ANIMALS: 1,218 unvaccinated animals that received PEP, 925 unvaccinated animals that were euthanatized instead of receiving PEP, and 3 preexposure vaccinated dogs that developed rabies. METHODS: Zoonotic incident reports from 2010 through 2019 were reviewed for information regarding animals with no known rabies vaccination that received PEP or were euthanatized in accordance with state protocol after exposure to a laboratory-confirmed rabid animal; reports were also reviewed for any preexposure and postexposure vaccination failures. The state-required PEP protocol was to immediately vaccinate the animal against rabies, confine the animal for 90 days, and administer booster vaccines during the third and eighth weeks of the confinement period. RESULTS: From 2010 through 2019, 1,218 exposed animals received PEP; 99.8% did not develop rabies. Three failures were recorded, all in animals < 12 weeks of age when PEP was initiated. Additionally, 925 exposed animals were euthanatized instead of receiving PEP. One true preexposure vaccination failure was recorded. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The Texas PEP protocol was used during the 10-year period. Results indicated that this protocol is a viable option for unvaccinated domestic animals exposed to rabies.

Recently, a computational adjoint-based optimization method was used to design shaped film cooling holes fed by internal co-flow and cross-flow channels. The associated Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computations predicted that the holes optimized for use with cross-flow (X-AOpt) and co-flow (Co-AOpt) would significantly increase adiabatic effectiveness. However, only the X-AOpt hole was tested experimentally in this previous study. Though the experimentally measured performance for this hole was much less than computationally predicted, it still had a 75% improved performance compared to the conventional 7-7-7-shaped hole. In the current study, the X-AOpt and Co-AOpt-shaped holes were experimentally evaluated using measurements of adiabatic effectiveness and overall cooling effectiveness. Coolant was fed to the holes with an internal co-flow channel. For reference, experiments were also conducted with the baseline 7-7-7-shaped hole, and a 15-15-1-shaped hole (shown in a previous study to be the optimum expansion angles for a shaped hole). Furthermore, overall cooling effectiveness measurements were made with engine-scale models to evaluate the performance of additively manufactured (AM) X-AOpt and Co-AOpt holes with a realistic metal build. Results from this study confirmed that the X-AOpt hole had a 75% increase in adiabatic effectiveness compared to the 7-7-7-shaped hole. However, the Co-AOpt hole had only a 30% increase in adiabatic effectiveness, substantially less than had been computationally predicted. Measurements of overall cooling effectiveness for the engine-scale models and the large-scale models followed similar trends.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/turbomachinery/article-pdf/146/11/111010/7351386/turbo_146_11_111010.pdf",""

Despite this emergent threat to corals, many questions still remain regarding mechanisms underlying observed variation in disease susceptibility. Recent data suggest at least some degree of variation in disease response may be linked to variability in the relationship between host corals and their algal photosymbionts (Family Symbiodiniaceae). Still, the nuances of connections between symbiosis and immunity in cnidarians, including scleractinian corals, remain poorly understood. Here, we leveraged an emergent model species, the facultatively symbiotic, temperate, scleractinian coral Astrangia poculata, to investigate associations between symbiont density and both constitutive and induced immunity. We used a combination of controlled immune challenges with heat-inactivated pathogens and transcriptomic analyses. Our results demonstrate that A. poculata mounts a robust initial response to pathogenic stimuli that is highly similar to responses documented in tropical corals. We document positive associations between symbiont density and both constitutive and induced immune responses, in agreement with recent preliminary studies in A. poculata. A suite of immune genes, including those coding for antioxidant peroxiredoxin biosynthesis, are positively associated with symbiont density in A. poculata under constitutive conditions. Furthermore, variation in symbiont density is associated with distinct patterns of immune response; low symbiont density corals induce preventative immune mechanisms, whereas high symbiont density corals mobilize energetic resources to fuel humoral immune responses. In summary, our study reveals the need for more nuanced study of symbiosis-immune interplay across diverse scleractinian corals, preferably including quantitative energy budget analysis for full disentanglement of these complex associations and their effects on host pathogen susceptibility.","https://academic.oup.com/icb/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/icb/icae036/58003852/icae036.pdf",""

Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL; Hermetia illucens) has been identified as a potential livestock feed because it is not expected to compete in the human food sector and its production has a lesser environmental footprint than that of conventional feeds. Existing research on BSFL as feed focuses on full-fat BSFL for poultry and aquaculture. Therefore, the objective of our experiment was to evaluate the viability of defatted BSFL as an alternative protein source for beef cattle consuming forage. Procedures were approved by Texas State University IACUC (#7726). Two experiments were conducted using ruminally cannulated beef steers fed low-quality forage in 5 × 5 Latin squares. Experiment 1 assessed consumption of BSFL as a protein supplement and included five 5-d periods with 3-d for washout and 2-d for measurement of supplement intake and preference. There were five treatments delivered in addition to the basal forage: 100% soybean meal (SBM); 75% SBM/25% BSFL; 50% SBM/50% BSFL; 25% SBM/75% BSFL; and 100% BSFL. Supplement and forage intake did not differ between treatments (P ≥ 0.45) nor was there a treatment × day interaction (P ≥ 0.45). Experiment 2 evaluated the effect of BSFL supplementation on forage (5.3% crude protein) intake and digestion and included five 14-d periods with 8-d for treatment adaptation, 5-d for measurement of intake and digestion, and 1-d for determination of ruminal fermentation. There were four treatments of supplemental BSFL provided at graded N levels: 0, 50, 100, or 150 mg N/kg BW and one level of SBM at 100 mg N/kg BW. Increasing provision of BSFL linearly increased forage organic matter (OM) intake (P = 0.04), total OM intake (P &lt; 0.01), total digestible OM intake (P &lt; 0.01), dry matter digestibility (P = 0.01), and OM digestibility (P = 0.02). There were no significant differences (P ≥ 0.17) in intake or digestibility between levels of BSFL and SBM. Ultimately, defatted BSFL has potential to replace conventional feeds as a protein supplement without sacrificing forage utilization.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jas/skae168/58244141/skae168.pdf",""

Although bathymetric measurement was not initially a design goal for the mission, pre- and post-launch studies revealed ATLAS’s notable bathymetric mapping capability. ICESat-2 bathymetry has been used to support a wide range of coastal and nearshore science objectives. However, analysis of ICESat-2 bathymetry in numerous locations around the world revealed instances of missing or clipped bathymetry in areas where bathymetric measurement should be feasible. These missing data were due to the ATLAS receiver algorithms not being optimized for bathymetry capture. To address this, two updates have been made to ICESat-2’s receiver algorithm parameters with the goal of increasing the area for which ICESat-2 can provide bathymetry. This paper details the parameter changes and presents the results of a two-phased study designed to investigate ICESat-2’s bathymetry enhancements at both local and global scales. The results of both phases confirm that the new parameters achieved the intended goal of increasing the amount of bathymetry provided by ICESat-2. The site-specific phase demonstrates the ability to fill critical bathymetric data gaps in open ocean and coastal settings. The global analysis shows that the area of potential bathymetry approximately doubled, with 6.1 million km of new area in which bathymetric measurements may be feasible. These enhancements are anticipated to facilitate a range of science objectives and close the gap between ICESat-2 bathymetry and offshore sonar data.","",""

Significant differences were observed between CG and EG1, as well as between EG1 and EG2, with CG and EG2 showing higher response accuracy compared to EG1. Response time differences were also significant among the three groups. Further analysis revealed no significant difference in DP test accuracy means, indicating that limited or no availability of landmarks did not impact participants' distance perception. However, SP test accuracy showed a significant difference, suggesting that the presence or absence of landmarks influenced participants' ability to perceive size. Pairwise comparisons indicated that SP responses in CG and EG2 were more accurate than in EG1. Response time analysis showed a significant difference in SP test response time between EG1 and EG2, with EG1 having longer response times. Gender analysis in EG1 revealed that males performed more accurately than females in this test condition. Demographic factors such as age and gamer/non-gamer status did not significantly influence participants' response accuracy.

Finally, a 6-mm thick, 2-lens SID device replaced the collision cell entrance lens. SID dissociated 801 kDa GroEL into all combinations of subcomplexes, and the peaks were well-resolved allowing for confident assignment of product ions. This is the first time a novel prototype timsTOF Pro for nMS has been introduced with high resolving power ion mobility separation coupled to high m/z quadrupole selection and SID for protein complex fragmentation with product ion collection and detection across a broad m/z range of 1,500 to 40,000.","https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/66885a94c9c6a5c07a6591b5/original/adapting-a-trapped-ion-mobility-spectrometry-q-tof-mass-spectrometer-for-native-mass-spectrometry.pdf",""

However, a comprehensive investigation of bubble generation rates and slug flow parameters remains challenging. This research integrates hybrid wettability and modified dynamic contact angle models to address this important knowledge gap. Using the computational capabilities of the IsoAdvector multiphase method, we performed detailed simulations of complex multiphase flow scenarios with the OpenFOAM package. We then validated these simulation results through rigorous comparison with available experimental data, thereby strengthening the accuracy and reliability of our numerical simulations. Our comprehensive research demonstrates the profound effect of altering contact angle distribution patterns on several critical parameters. These results highlight the precise control that can be achieved through the strategic manipulation of these patterns, offering the possibility of adjusting factors such as bubble production rate, slug length, bubble diameter, the relationship of flow residence to bubble movement, bubble movement speed in the channel, and pressure drop. Interestingly, altering these patterns can also induce asymmetric behavior in bubbles under microgravity conditions, a phenomenon that has significant implications for various applications. Such insights are crucial for fields such as heat transfer in energy systems, reaction mechanisms in chemical processes, multiphase flow control in petrochemical industries, fluid dynamics in aerospace engineering, and cooling mechanisms in electronic devices. With the ability to modulate these fundamental parameters, we gain valuable insights into the design and optimization of microchannel systems. Consequently, this research presents a more efficient and innovative approach to multiphase flow control, promising improved operational performance, and efficiency in various engineering applications.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/5.0188262/19692227/023351_1_5.0188262.pdf",""

Results show compliance is higher when the experimental audit rate is stated (versus unstated) and under a flat pay (versus incentive pay) structure.

Finding an association between tax CAMs and one of these tax outcomes would indicate that the new auditor reporting standard has indirectly affected investors. Examining the first year of CAM disclosures, we do not find that tax CAMs are associated with broad proxies of tax‐related audit or financial reporting quality (e.g., restatements, internal control weaknesses, comment letters) or tax avoidance (e.g., effective tax rates or book‐to‐tax differences). We do find that tax CAMs are associated with a modest increase in tax accrual quality, an increase in the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits, and a reduction in the likelihood of tax‐related earnings management.

Long-standing speculation is that adoption of smoking social norms in the U.S. that are less restrictive for women and more restrictive for men compared to smoking social norms in Mexico may account for these patterns. However, it is unknown whether persons who smoke actually perceive such differential norms. The current study characterized smoking social norms in the U.S. and Mexico among Spanish-speaking Mexican-origin persons who smoke. Two hundred and ninety Mexican-origin persons who smoke were surveyed on descriptive and injunctive norms for men and women in the U.S. and Mexico.

Findings do not support speculation that differential social norms may explain the acculturation-smoking relationship among Mexican-origin women.

By conducting a mail-out survey, we obtained 100 responses, which were analyzed using an exploratory factor analysis and a series of nonparametric assessments. The results revealed that, contrary to the term “absentee”, the landowners in our study demonstrated strong feelings of place attachment and heightened land stewardship. Based on these findings, we suggest that instead of considering absentee landowners as obstacles to collaborative conservation initiatives, such as WPPs, natural resource practitioners should recognize and capitalize on the emotional attachment that these landowners have to their properties, thereby fostering their involvement.

Such junctions are under consideration for applications in digital superconducting logic and memory. In the presence of the exchange field, spin–singlet Cooper pairs from conventional superconductors undergo rapid phase oscillations as they propagate through a ferromagnetic material. As a result, the ground-state phase difference across a ferromagnetic Josephson junction oscillates between 0 and π as a function of the thickness of the ferromagnetic material. π-junctions have been proposed as circuit elements in superconducting digital logic and in certain qubit designs for quantum computing. If a junction contains two or more ferromagnetic layers whose relative magnetization directions can be controlled by a small applied magnetic field, then the junction can serve as the foundation for a memory cell. Success in all of those applications requires careful choices of ferromagnetic materials. Often, materials that optimize magnetic properties do not optimize supercurrent propagation, and vice versa. In this review, we discuss the significant progress that has been made in identifying and testing a wide range of ferromagnetic materials in Josephson junctions over the past two decades. The review concentrates on ferromagnetic metals, partly because eventual industrial applications of ferromagnetic Josephson junctions will most likely start with metallic ferromagnets (either in all metal junctions or junctions containing an insulating layer).

Our measure provides a simple measure of disaggregation by counting the balance sheet and income statement line items, it does not depend on the data aggregators’ collection process and is readily available shortly after the Form 10-K is filed. We validate ITEMS by showing that firm fundamentals correlate to ITEMS in the predicted direction using OLS regression. We find that ITEMS explains consequences of disclosure quality: forecast error, forecast dispersion, bid-ask spread, and cost of equity capital.

Early radiobiology was dominated by physics and biophysical concepts that borrowed heavily from the study of radiation-induced chromosome aberrations. From such studies, quantitative relationships between biological effect and changes in absorbed dose, dose rate and ionization density were codified into key concepts of radiobiological theory that have persisted for nearly a century. This review aims to provide a historical perspective of some of these concepts, including evidence supporting the contention that chromosome aberrations underlie development of many, if not most, of the biological effects of concern for humans exposed to ionizing radiations including cancer induction, on the one hand, and tumor eradication on the other. The significance of discoveries originating from these studies has widened and extended far beyond their original scope. Chromosome structural rearrangements viewed in mitotic cells were first attributed to the production of breaks by the radiations during interphase, followed by the rejoining or mis-rejoining among ends of other nearby breaks. These relatively modest beginnings eventually led to the discovery and characterization of DNA repair of double-strand breaks by non-homologous end joining, whose importance to various biological processes is now widely appreciated. Two examples, among many, are V(D)J recombination and speciation. Rapid technological advancements in cytogenetics, the burgeoning fields of molecular radiobiology and third-generation sequencing served as a point of confluence between the old and new. As a result, the emergent field of “cytogenomics” now becomes uniquely positioned for the purpose of more fully understanding mechanisms underlying the biological effects of ionizing radiation exposure.","https://meridian.allenpress.com/radiation-research/article-pdf/doi/10.1667/RADE-24-00038.1/3396023/10.1667_rade-24-00038.1.pdf",""

It is also important for city planners and policymakers to create more efficient plans and policies for urban areas. Traditionally, human movement patterns were analyzed using origin–destination surveys, travel diaries, and other methods. Now, these patterns can be identified from various geospatial big data sources, such as mobile phone data, floating car data, and location-based social media (LBSM) data. These extensive datasets primarily identify individual or collective human movement patterns. However, the impact of spatial scale on the analysis of human movement patterns from these large geospatial data sources has not been sufficiently studied. Changes in spatial scale can significantly affect the results when calculating human movement patterns from these data. In this study, we utilized Weibo datasets for three different cities in China including Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shanghai. We aimed to identify the effect of different spatial scales on individual human movement patterns as calculated from LBSM data. For our analysis, we employed two indicators as follows: an external activity space indicator, the radius of gyration (ROG), and an internal activity space indicator, entropy. These indicators were chosen based on previous studies demonstrating their efficiency in analyzing sparse datasets like LBSM data. Additionally, we used two different ranges of spatial scales—10–100 m and 100–3000 m—to illustrate changes in individual activity space at both fine and coarse spatial scales. Our results indicate that although the ROG values show an overall increasing trend and the entropy values show an overall decreasing trend with the increase in spatial scale size, different local factors influence the ROG and entropy values at both finer and coarser scales. These findings will help to comprehend the dynamics of human movement across different scales. Such insights are invaluable for enhancing overall urban mobility and optimizing transportation systems.","https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/12/3796/pdf",""

Employing a novel machine learning technique known as 'causal forest,' we explore heterogeneous treatment effects on retention. Methods We relied on four waves of the National Drug Abuse Treatment System Survey (NDATSS), a nationally representative longitudinal dataset of treatment programs. We analyzed OUD program data from the years 2000, 2005, 2014 and 2017 (n = 627). Employing the 'causal forest' method, we analyzed the heterogeneity in the relationship between workforce diversity and retention in OUD treatment. Interviews with program directors and clinical supervisors provided the data for this study. Results The results reveal diversity-related variations in the association with retention across 61 out of 627 OUD treatment programs (less than 10%). These programs, associated with positive impacts of workforce diversity, were more likely private-for-profit, newer, had lower percentages of Black and Latino clients, lower staff-to-client ratios, higher proportions of staff with graduate degrees, and lower percentages of unemployed clients. Conclusions While workforce diversity is crucial, our findings underscore that it alone is insufficient for improving retention in addiction health services research.

Finding ways to increase women’s comfort and satisfaction with contraceptive use is therefore critical to public health. One promising pathway for improving patient outcomes is through the use of digital decision aids that assist women and their physicians in choosing a contraceptive option that women are comfortable with. Testing the ability of these aids to improve patient outcomes is therefore a necessary first step toward incorporating this technology into traditional physician appointments. Purpose: To evaluate the effectiveness of a novel contraceptive decision aid at minimizing decisional conflict and increasing comfort with contraception among adult women. Methods: In total, 310 adult women were assigned to use either the Tuune contraceptive decision aid or a control aid modeled after a leading online contraceptive prescriber’s patient intake form. Participants then completed self-report measures of decisional conflict, contraceptive expectations, satisfaction, and contraceptive use intentions. Individual between-subjects analysis of variance (ANOVA) models were used to examine these outcomes. Results: Women using the Tuune decision aid (vs. those using the control aid) reported lower decisional conflict, more positive contraceptive expectations, greater satisfaction with the decision aid and recommendation, and more positive contraceptive use intentions. Conclusions: Use of Tuune improved each of the predicted patient outcomes relative to a control decision aid. Online decision aids, particularly when used alongside physician consultations, may be an effective tool for increasing comfort with contraceptive use.

The brokered condition led to the highest level of intergroup activity, and the final product novelty across all conditions was influenced by the novelty of the ideas and elaborations in the prior session.

Nonetheless, the influence of leaf shelters and arthropods on plant-associated microbiota remains largely unexplored. Arthropods that visit or inhabit plants can contribute to the leaf microbial community, resulting in significant changes in plant-microbe interactions. By artificially constructing leaf shelters, we provide evidence that shelter-building insects influence not only the arthropod community structure but also impact the phyllosphere microbiota. Leaf shelters exhibited higher abundance and richness of arthropods, leading to changes in the associated arthropod community composition. These shelters also altered the composition and community structure of phyllosphere microbiota, promoting greater richness and diversity of bacteria at the phyllosphere. In leaf shelters, microbial diversity increased with the richness and diversity of herbivores. These findings demonstrate the critical role of leaf shelters in structuring arthropod communities by facilitating colonization and influencing microbial communities through altered microhabitats and community interactions.","",""

Habitat complexity affects species composition and shapes animal ecology, physiology, behavior, and cognition. We used a delayed detour test to measure whether cognitive processes (motor self-regulation) and behavior (risk-taking) of female Western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, varied with habitat structural complexity (low, moderate, and high) that was quantified visually for nine populations. We predicted that motor self-regulation and risk-taking behavior would increase with increasing habitat complexity, yet we found support for the opposite. Lower complexity habitats offer less refuge potentially leading to higher predation pressure and selecting for greater risk-taking by fish with higher motor self-regulation. Our findings provide insight into how habitat complexity can shape cognitive processes and behavior and offers a broader understanding of why some species may tolerate conditions of urbanized environments.","",""

All participants were administered the MMPI-2-Restructured Form-Extended Battery (MMPI-2-RF-EX) or MMPI-3 and the Personality Inventory for the DSM-5 Short Form (PID-5-SF). First, we conducted correlation analyses between theoretically overlapping scales of the PID-5-SF and the MMPI-3 among White and Latinx individuals.

Hierarchical regression subsequently determined the presence of slope and/or intercept bias. Only one analysis (the MMPI-3 Anger Proneness prediction of PID-5-SF Negative Affectivity) indicated statistically significant intercept bias. No evidence of slope bias was found. In other words, these analyses indicated that the vast majority of the relationships between MMPI-3 scales and associated personality psychopathology constructs (as measured by the PID-5-SF) remained consistent across both ethnic groups.

Result: At both reservoirs, LBC home range areas were small (<50 ha) and overall movement was low (~40–100 m/week). Fish primarily occupied water column depths of less than 2 m in both reservoirs and were found in the shallowest depths during the spring. Although overall structural habitat occurrence and selection of LBC fish varied between reservoirs, primarily due to differences at shorelines and creeks (two times higher in Toledo Bend Reservoir) and drops (three times higher in Lake Fork Reservoir), fish selected for the shoreline, drops, points, and creeks in both reservoirs, while drains and flats reflected avoidance. Seasonally, habitat occurrence of LBC fish varied at Toledo Bend Reservoir, primarily due to differences in shoreline use, and flats had the highest fish occurrences during all seasons. At Lake Fork Reservoir, LBC occurrences at flats and drops were high and similar during all seasons. Conclusion: Our estimates of small LBC home ranges and low movement in these large reservoirs were generally similar to those reported in previous studies, regardless of reservoir size.

Method: Data were collected from African American couples between October 2019 and January 2020 as part of a larger study called the Strong African American Couples Project. Utilizing dyadic panels from Qualtrics, this project specifically targeted African American couples who were cohabiting ( Results: Significant actor effects were found between sanctification and individual as well as perceived partner forgiveness in married and cohabiting couple relationships. No significant partner effects were found. Conclusion: These findings highlight the importance of recognizing various aspects of religiosity and spirituality within relationships, especially for African American couples with historically high rates of dissolution and self‐rated religiosity. Implications: As interventionalists work with religious and spiritual African American couples, they need to understand the role that sanctity may have within these partner relationships and the positive impact it can have on relational outcomes.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/fare.13026",""

In this study, we use behavioral threshold theory to propose a curvilinear relationship between employees' psychopathy and their counterproductive work behavior (CWB). Our predictions were corroborated across three studies involving two countries while controlling for narcissism and Machiavellianism. Specifically, we find that the destructive nature of psychopathy is amplified with accelerated levels of CWB among individuals high on psychopathy. These results address mixed and unexpected findings in the literature, thereby offering a more nuanced understanding of the psychopathy–CWB relationship. Drawing additionally on trait activation theory, we examine the moderating effects of social context as manifested in relationship conflict with coworkers and abusive supervision. Results support the moderated hypotheses such that the psychopathy–CWB curvilinear relationship is stronger in negative social environments for both self‐rated and other‐rated CWB assessments. As the relationships between individuals' dark traits and behavioral outcomes are likely more complex than simple linear relations, we advocate future research to combine complementary theoretical lenses for improved theoretical precision.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/job.2783",""

These composites are highly valued for their exceptional thermal and thermo-mechanical properties, including remarkably low density and coefficient of thermal expansion, which are expected to surpass those of many alloys and other composites in the production of high-grade components. However, the current manufacturing methods for C-C composites are unable to meet market demands due to their high cost, low production speed, and labor-intensive processes, limiting their broader applications. This study presents an innovative approach by introducing a new extrusion-based 3D printing method using multiphase direct ink writing (MDIW) for C-C composite fabrication. The primary matrix utilized is a phenolformaldehyde thermosetting resin, reinforced with silicon carbide (SiC) and graphite nanopowder (Gnp), focusing on achieving simple, scalable, and environmentally sustainable production of green parts with enhanced polymer matrix. This is followed by an inert carbonization process to obtain the final C-C composites. The research emphasizes the careful optimization of curing and rheological properties, including the use of suitable viscosity modifiers like carbon black (CB). Furthermore, the MDIW process demonstrates its capability to pattern dual nanoparticles within the composite structure in a well-ordered manner, leading to improved overall performance.

Separate linear-mixed effect models were used to assess outcomes of RPE, soreness, and sleep duration. A linear mixed-effects model explained 59% of the variance in RPE following each session. Specifically, each standard deviation increase in GPS load and mental stress in the morning prior to training increased RPE by 1.46(SE=0.08) and 0.29(SE= 0.07) respectively, following that day’s training. Furthermore, a significant interaction was found between several predictor variables and chronological day in the season while predicting RPE. Specifically, for each standard deviation increase in GPS load, RPE went up by 0.055 per day across the season suggesting that load had a higher impact on RPE as the season progressed. In contrast, the interaction of day by mental stress, sleep duration, and soreness continued to be stronger as the season progressed.

Monopsony characterizes a market with a single buyer and many suppliers. Accordingly, monopsony power is a potentially critical determinant of cost structure because it affects managers’ resource procurement decisions. Results indicate that hospitals with monopsony power adopt more elastic cost structures, and monopsony power magnifies the positive relationship between demand uncertainty and cost elasticity identified in prior research. These findings suggest monopsony power lowers the costs of procuring resources on flexible, short-term, and variable bases as opposed to making long-term commitments. Therefore, due to the high fixed-cost nature of the industry, hospitals with monopsony power choose more variable cost structures and make larger cost structure adjustments in response to demand uncertainty. Although we conduct this research using hospitals, our theory and results have implications for other industries.","https://publications.aaahq.org/jmar/article-pdf/36/2/157/109622/i1049-2127-36-2-157.pdf",""

Due to their intrinsic architecture, conventional neural networks cannot be successfully trained and scoped when data are sparse, which is the case in many scientific and engineering domains. Nonetheless, neural networks provide a solid foundation to respect physics-driven or knowledge-based constraints during training. Generally speaking, there are three distinct neural network frameworks to enforce the underlying physics: (i) physics-guided neural networks (PgNNs), (ii) physics-informed neural networks (PiNNs), and (iii) physics-encoded neural networks (PeNNs). These methods provide distinct advantages for accelerating the numerical modeling of complex multiscale multiphysics phenomena. In addition, the recent developments in neural operators (NOs) add another dimension to these new simulation paradigms, especially when the real-time prediction of complex multiphysics systems is required. All these models also come with their own unique drawbacks and limitations that call for further fundamental research.

Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) serves as a recognized precursor to DBP formation, which can potentially jeopardize human health. This review article offers a comprehensive insight into DON's influence on DBP formation during water and wastewater treatment processes. It delves into DON's sources, properties, and concentrations in water and wastewater, underlining the variability dependent on water source and environmental conditions. The mechanisms of DBP formation from DON, encompassing formation pathways and influencing factors, are meticulously examined. Different treatment methods, like chlorination, ozonation, and UV disinfection, are carefully examined to see how they affect the formation of DON and DBP. Factors that sway DON's impact on DBP formation are also explored. The review also presents various DBP reduction techniques, spanning physical, chemical, and biological treatment methods, their efficacy in curtailing DON's influence, and their potential pros and cons. It addresses challenges, outlines future research directions, identifies knowledge gaps, and highlights the necessity for regulatory measures and policies, providing recommendations for prospective research avenues. It is clear from this in-depth review that more research is needed to understand how DON affects the formation of DBP entirely. It is also essential to protect human health and the environment and follow the rules first when treating wastewater. In conclusion, it analyzes DON's part in forming DBP in water and wastewater treatment. This emphasizes the need for ongoing research and mitigation strategies to protect public health and water quality.","",""

Meso‐ and bathy‐pelagic fishes inhabit some of the most temporally and spatially stable habitats on the planet. The stability of the deep‐pelagic could make deep‐pelagic fishes resistant to the demographic instability commonly reported in fish species inhabiting other marine habitats, however the demographic histories of deep‐pelagic fishes are unknown. We reconstructed the historical demography of 11 species of deep‐pelagic fishes using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence data. We uncovered widespread evidence of population expansions in our study species, a counterintuitive result based on the nature of deep‐pelagic ecosystems. Frequency‐based methods detected potential demographic changes in nine species of fishes, while extended Bayesian skyline plots identified population expansions in four species. These results suggest that despite the relatively stable nature of the deep‐pelagic environment, the fishes that reside here have likely been impacted by past changes in climate. Further investigation is necessary to better understand how deep‐pelagic fishes, by far Earth's most abundant vertebrates, will respond to future climatic changes.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ece3.11267",""

HAI treatments extend hospital lengths of stay and increase hospital operational costs while significantly reducing hospital profit margins. Given these challenges, the research aim of this study was to explore the association between HAIs and hospital financial performance. A better understanding of this relationship can assist hospital leaders in optimizing the use of scarce financial resources to reduce HAI prevalence. Methods: Data for calendar year 2022 for active short-term acute care hospitals (n = 1454) in the US were analyzed using multiple linear regression analysis. We explored two derived dependent variables, operating expense per staffed bed and operating expense per discharge. The independent variables included four healthcare-associated infection rates: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection rate, Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection rate, Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI) rate, and Central Line Associated Blood Stream Infections (CLABSI). Appropriate organizational and market-level variables that may independently influence hospital financial performance were included as control variables. Results: The results revealed that C. diff (β: 0.037, p < 0.05) and CAUTI (β: 0.031, p < 0.05) rates were positively associated with an increase in operating expense per staffed bed, while increases in MRSA (β: 0.042, p < 0.001), C. diff (β: 0.062, p < 0.001), and CAUTI rates (β: 0.039, p < 0.001) were correlated with increased operating expenses per discharge. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that specific HAIs may be associated with increased hospital expenses. Proactively targeting these infections through tailored interventions may lead to reduced hospital costs, improved financial performance, and economic stability.","https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/12/13/1314/pdf",""

Reports of rice stink bug resistance to pyrethroids in Texas first surfaced in 2015 and continued to spread. To determine the status of pyrethroid resistance, rice stink bug populations across Texas and Louisiana were evaluated from 2021 to 2023. Mortality was assessed through glass vial exposures to eight concentrations (0, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 30 μg/vial) of a pyrethroid, lambda-cyhalothrin. The concentration of lambda-cyhalothrin required to kill 50% (LC50) of each population was estimated by probit analysis. Furthermore, the efficacy of insecticides, including lambda-cyhalothrin, dimethoate, and dinotefuran, were evaluated in field experiments conducted in 2021. Our results indicated that 14 of the 21 rice stink bug populations sampled were resistant to lambda-cyhalothrin, with LC50 values ranging from 42 to 1,600 times higher than a susceptible population. In the field trial, lambda-cyhalothrin did not control rice stink bugs. Dinotefuran provided excellent control of nymphs, but dimethoate provided greater control of adult rice stink bugs. To our knowledge, this is the first study to thoroughly evaluate the extent or geographic range of pyrethroid resistance in Texas for rice stink bugs.","https://academic.oup.com/jee/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jee/toae155/58582961/toae155.pdf",""

The altered chemical composition of produced water leads to flocculation and decreased performance of products, specifically emulsion polymer friction reducers traditionally used in freshwater. Flocculation leads to poor regained conductivity, formation damage, and less oil production. Operators may use a higher dosage of emulsion polymer to combat the change in composition, leading to concern over cost, treatment efficacy, and environmental, social, and governance regulations.

Conservation and governmental groups worldwide have designated protected areas to preserve the remaining diversity. The biodiversity hotspot approach, which designates areas based on high levels of species richness, has been useful for identifying areas to protect both terrestrial and aquatic species. However, for freshwater species, additional approaches are warranted to identify specific stream reaches for protection and/or restoration. To address this issue, we present a methodology to create a Gridded River Identification System (GRIS) for river segments based on 30 arc‐second grids (~0.9 km) using the USGS National Hydrography High Resolution Dataset. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we obtained occurrence data for six imperiled freshwater mussel species in Texas and created ensemble species distribution models (ESDMs) based on climate and topographical variables. Predicted occupancies were overlayed onto the GRIS in Texas. The predicted occupancies were rank ordered from 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest probability of occupancy and 5 being the greatest. The rank‐ordered segments were then used to identify reaches for conservation and restoration activities. Our approach is novel and widely applicable to other freshwater species so long as distribution information is available. The GRIS can also be easily developed for stream systems outside of the current study area. Future studies could build upon our framework by incorporating additional taxa data and projected changes in climate and land use.","https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ecs2.4772",""

These determine its interaction with the soil, influencing its impact on soil health and plant productivity. While most studies report the evaluation of one biochar and a single plant cultivar, the role of genetic background in responding to biochar as a soil amendment remains unexplored. The impact of six biochars on agronomic performance and fruit quality of three tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) cultivars was evaluated to test the hypotheses that (1) biochars derived from different feedstock sources would produce unique phenotypes in a single cultivar of tomato, and (2) single feedstock-derived biochar would produce different phenotypes in each of the three tomato cultivars.

Most plant RNA‐Seq analysis pipelines base the normalization approaches on the assumption that total transcript levels do not vary between samples. However, this assumption has not been demonstrated. In fact, many common experimental treatments and genetic alterations affect transcription efficiency or RNA stability, resulting in unequal transcript abundance. The addition of synthetic RNA controls is a simple correction that controls for variation in total mRNA levels. However, adding spike‐ins appropriately is challenging with complex plant tissue, and carefully considering how they are added is essential to their successful use. We demonstrate that adding external RNA spike‐ins as a normalization control produces differences in RNA‐Seq analysis compared to traditional normalization methods, even between two times of day in untreated plants. We illustrate the use of RNA spike‐ins with 3' RNA‐Seq and present a normalization pipeline that accounts for differences in total transcriptional levels. We evaluate the effect of normalization methods on identifying differentially expressed genes in the context of identifying the effect of the time of day on gene expression and response to chilling stress in sorghum.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/tpj.16654",""

Research Findings/Insights: We find evidence that both CEOs and CFOs time bank loan agreement announcements after option grant dates, significantly increase the stock purchased prior to (and the stock sold after) the announcement. Our results support management strategically timing of the bank loan agreement announcement as opposed to influencing the compensation committee to time the option grant date for the benefit of management. While these findings complement prior research on the proven CEOs opportunistic behavior around corporate events, they offer a new conspicuous evidence of CFOs opportunistic behavior. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study contributes to the literature on opportunistic managerial behavior around corporate events by examining the stock option grants, exercises, and stock trades surrounding a major bank loan agreement and the relational interplay between the CEOs and CFOs. While concurrently testing and confirming the expected CEOs opportunistic behavior, the study augments the literature with strong evidence of CFOs opportunistic behavior coinciding with the announcement of bank loan agreements.

While research links BESD with peripheral inflammation, this literature is limited by underpowered studies and a failure to control for confounding variables that could promote inflammation independent of dysregulated eating, specifically elevated body adiposity and depression. Our study examined plasma interleukin‐6 (IL‐6), a marker of peripheral inflammation, in a sample of women with BESD and non‐eating disorder controls, controlling for BMI, body adiposity, and depression. Method: Participants ( Results: Significantly elevated plasma IL‐6 was found in women with BESD, relative to controls, that was not accounted for by BMI, adiposity, or depression. Plasma IL‐6 was positively correlated with plasma leptin concentration, clinical assessments of eating disorder severity, and participants' largest self‐reported eating episode. Discussion: Peripheral inflammation is specifically linked to presence of dysregulated eating independently from weight, adiposity, and depression in BESD. Future research should probe the potential role of neuroinflammation in altered eating behavior. Public Significance: This study provides the first demonstration that inflammation, characterized by elevated plasma IL‐6 concentration, is uniquely associated with dysregulated eating in a transdiagnostic group of individuals with BESD. A better understanding of whether immune factors contribute to dysregulated eating could help identify novel biological targets for intervention.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/eat.24183",""

However, less is known about how local labor market structure relates to drug overdose mortality amid the synthetic opioid era in the United States. This study investigates the relationship between industry‐specific job composition and drug overdose mortality at the county level while exploring how fentanyl's presence in illicit drug supplies may moderate the relationship. Methods: Data were derived from the National Center for Health Statistics' Multiple Cause of Death files for the rates of drug overdose mortality of any intent, linked with four other sources on industry‐specific job shares, drug supply, and county‐level sociodemographic characteristics and opioid prescribing rates from the US Census Bureau, the CDC, and the Drug Enforcement Administration. Negative binomial regression models were employed to examine associations between county industry‐specific job composition and drug overdose mortality, with tests for moderating effects of state‐level fentanyl seizure rates. Results: Our models indicate negative associations between job shares of manufacturing, retail trade, and educational services industries and drug overdose mortality. Positive associations were found for arts/entertainment/recreation and public administration. State‐level fentanyl seizure rates had moderating effects on administrative/support/waste management/remediation (A/S/WM/R) and educational services. Conclusion: Counties with a higher concentration of arts/entertainment/recreation and public administration jobs need targeted efforts to mitigate drug‐related overdose risks. Additionally, areas with higher concentrations of A/S/WM/R service jobs, particularly where fentanyl seizure rates are higher, may require proactive harm reduction strategies for reducing overdose risks.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ajim.23612",""

Numerical experiment from Monte Carlo simulation suggests that location-matched item selection achieves significantly better and more balanced item pool usage. Leveraging working speed in item selection distinctly reduced the average testing times as well as variation across the examinees.

The UNOS database population from 2004 to 2015 was used to construct the cohorts. A total of 21,032 were transplanted during this period. The transplant data were further queried to extract CF-axial flow pumps BTT (HMII-BTT) patients and patients who did not have VAD support before the transplant. A total of 4224 transplant recipients had HMII at the time of transplant, and 13,131 did not have VAD support.

Combining imagery and height data captured by the sonar array with a detection and tracking algorithm enables the trajectories, velocities, and behavior of fish in the aggregation to be observed. Fitting the velocity and height data of the tracked objects to a Gaussian mixture model and performing cluster analysis enables an estimate of the near-surface ambient velocity via observation of the movement of the bubble traces and the general direction of motion of the fish aggregation.

However, in some instances, cases with additional defects (e.g., spina bifida and clubfoot) may be more appropriately considered as isolated because the co‐occurring defect (clubfoot) is believed to be developmentally related to the defect of interest. Determining which combinations should be considered isolated can be challenging and potentially resource intensive for registries. Thus, we developed automated classification procedures for differentiating between isolated versus multiple defects, while accounting for developmentally related defects, and applied the approach to data from the Texas Birth Defects Registry (1999–2018 deliveries). Among 235,544 nonsyndromic cases in Texas, 89% of cases were classified as having isolated defects, with proportions ranging from 25% to 92% across 43 specific defects analyzed. A large proportion of isolated cases with spina bifida (44%), lower limb reduction defects (44%), and holoprosencephaly (32%) had developmentally related defects.

Methods: Our proposed approach is to add a tiny value to the vote share of parties that do not contest a district and then to include dummy variables identifying those districts in which parties do not compete. We can then estimate a single system of equations using a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) approach and Aitchison's log‐ratio transformation. In our SUR system, we interact the dummy variable for a party that partially contested districts with other predictors in the equation that uses the share of votes of the same party in the log‐ratio outcome. Finally, we estimate robust standard errors for predictors in this equation to address heteroscedasticity. Results: We demonstrate the utility of our approach using simulated data and election results from the English parliamentary elections in 2017. Conclusion: From our simulations, we find that our recommended approach performs as well as that proposed by Tom, Tucker, and Wittenberg. Our strategy is advantageous in that it is easy to estimate, uses information from all districts, and addresses partial contestation in real‐world elections with a single system of seemingly unrelated regressions.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ssqu.13408",""

An important feature of our new method is that the approximate solution for the flux variable is obtained without approximating the pressure at all. To accomplish this, we introduce a user‐defined parameter delta, which is typically chosen to be small so that it minimizes the negative effect resulting from the absence of the pressure, such as inaccuracy in both the flux approximation and the mass conservation. The resulting algebraic system is of significantly smaller degrees of freedom, compared to the one from the mixed finite element methods or least‐squares methods. We also interpret the proposed method as a single step iterate of the augmented Lagrangian Uzawa applied to solve the mixed finite element in a special setting. Lastly, the pressure recovery from the flux variable is discussed and an optimal‐order error estimate for the method is obtained.

Emerging evidence suggests organisms in higher trophic levels may also influence microbial communities, but whether warming alters these effects is unclear. Wolf spiders are dominant Arctic predators whose densities are expected to increase with warming. These predators have temperature-dependent effects on decomposition via their consumption of fungal-feeding detritivores, suggesting they may indirectly affect the microbial structure as well. To address this, we used a fully factorial mesocosm experiment to test the effects of wolf spider density and warming on litter microbial structure in Arctic tundra. We deployed replicate litter bags at the surface and belowground in the organic soil profile and analyzed the litter for bacterial and fungal community structure, mass loss, and nutrient characteristics after 2 and 14 months. We found there were significant interactive effects of wolf spider density and warming on fungal but not bacterial communities. Specifically, higher wolf spider densities caused greater fungal diversity under ambient temperature but lower fungal diversity under warming at the soil surface. We also observed interactive treatment effects on fungal composition belowground. Wolf spider density influenced surface bacterial composition, but the effects did not change with warming. These findings suggest a widespread predator can have indirect, cascading effects on litter microbes and that effects on fungi specifically shift under future expected levels of warming. Overall, our study highlights that trophic interactions may play important, albeit overlooked, roles in driving microbial responses to warming in Arctic terrestrial ecosystems. IMPORTANCE: The Arctic contains nearly half of the global pool of soil organic carbon and is one of the fastest warming regions on the planet. Accelerated decomposition of soil organic carbon due to warming could cause positive feedbacks to climate change through increased greenhouse gas emissions; thus, changes in ecological dynamics in this region are of global relevance. Microbial structure is an important driver of decomposition and is affected by both abiotic and biotic conditions. Yet how activities of soil-dwelling organisms in higher trophic levels influence microbial structure and function is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that predicted changes in abundances of a dominant predator and warming interactively affect the structure of litter-dwelling fungal communities in the Arctic. These findings suggest predators may have widespread, indirect cascading effects on microbial communities, which could influence ecosystem responses to future climate change.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/mbio.00590-24",""

Steers were housed in individual pens inside a barn and randomly assigned to one of three treatments: (1) low-starch control diet comprised primarily of dry-rolled corn and wet corn gluten feed (CON); (2) high-starch acidotic diet with steam-flaked corn (AD); or (3) acidotic diet plus intraruminal inoculation with Fusobacterium necrophorum subsp. necrophorum (9.8 × 108 colony forming units [CFU]/mL), Trueperella pyogenes (3.91 × 109 CFU/mL), and Salmonella enterica serovar Lubbock (3.07 × 108 CFU/mL), previously isolated from LA (ADB). Steers in AD and ADB were fed the acidotic diet for 3 d followed by 2 d of the CON diet, and this cycle was repeated four times. On day 23, ADB steers were intraruminally inoculated with the bacteria. At necropsy, gross pathology of livers, lungs, rumens, and colons was noted. Continuous data were analyzed via mixed models as repeated measures over time with individual steer as the experimental unit. Mixed models were also used to determine the difference in prevalence of necropsy scores among treatments. Ruminal pH decreased in AD and ADB steers during each acidotic diet cycle (P ≤ 0.05). LA prevalence was 42.9% (6 of 14) in ADB vs. 0% in AD or CON treatments (P &lt; 0.01). Ruminal damage was 51.1% greater in ADB than in AD (P ≤ 0.04). Culture of LA determined that 100% of the abscesses contained F. necrophorum subsp. necrophorum, 0% contained T. pyogenes, 50% contained Salmonella, and 50% contained a combination of F. necrophorum subsp. necrophorum and Salmonella. The F. necrophorum subsp. necrophorum was clonally identical to the strain used for the bacterial inoculation based on phylogenetic analysis of the whole genome. This experimental model successfully induced rumenitis and LA in Holstein steers and confirms the central dogma of LA pathogenesis that acidosis and rumenitis lead to the entry of F. necrophorum into the liver to cause abscesses. Our findings suggest that an acidotic diet, in conjunction with intraruminal bacterial inoculation, is a viable model to induce LA. Further research is needed to determine the repeatability of this model, and a major application of the model will be in evaluations of novel interventions to prevent LA.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jas/skae046/56878014/skae046.pdf",""

Although the Supreme Court’s decision in Obergefell v. Hodges (2015) legalized and legitimized same-sex marriages and relationships in the U.S., mandating the inclusion of same-sex partners in protective order laws and yielding collateral benefits for victims of same-sex IPV, it is unclear if the decision has had a positive effect on same-sex IPV clearance rates. This study uses National Incident-Based Reporting System data to compare IPV clearance (arrest, dual arrest, victim noncooperation, and prosecution declined) pre (2013/2014) and post (2016/2017) Obergefell v. Hodges (2015). Regression results show no substantial changes in same-sex IPV clearance after Obergefell v. Hodges (2015). Compared to opposite-sex IPV, same-sex IPV was less likely to be cleared by arrest but much more likely to be cleared by dual arrest, victim noncooperation, and prosecution declined. Same-sex IPV involving Black couples and married partners were also less likely to be cleared by arrest but more likely to be cleared by dual arrest than Black/White same-sex IPV and incidents involving unmarried partners, respectively. Moreover, same-sex IPV victims experience unfavorable criminal justice outcomes in states with mandatory arrest policies but fare better in states that supported same-sex relationships prior to Obergefell.

A total of 180 heifers (75% Angus × 25% Brahman) were used in this experiment replicated over 2 yr. Each year, 90 heifers were ranked by age (264 ± 1 d) and body weight (BW on day −3; 200 ± 2 kg) on day 0, and assigned to a) one of six drylot pens (10 × 14 m pens; 10 heifers per pen) with a stocking density of 14 m2/heifer (DENS), or b) one of three pastures (2-ha pastures; 10 heifers per pasture) with a stocking density of 2,000 m2/heifer (CON). Beginning on day 15, three DENS pens were given access to an exercise area (DENS-EX) 3 times/wk (1 h). Negligible forage was available for CON, whereas heifers from all treatments received the same limit-fed diet (~13 kg/heifer daily). Shrunk BW was recorded after 16 h of feed and water withdrawal on days −3 and 225 to calculate BW gain. Temperament was evaluated on days 0, 128, and 224. Heifers were fitted with a pedometer behind their shoulder on day 0 to record physical activity. Pedometer results and blood samples were collected weekly for progesterone analysis. Hair samples from the tail switch were collected every 28 d. Data were analyzed with pen or pasture as an experimental unit, via ANOVA using the MIXED or GLIMMIX procedures of SAS (SAS Inst. Inc., Cary, NC). Heifers from CON had more (P &lt; 0.01) steps per week compared with DENS and DENS-EX (23,973, 6,706, and 12,354 steps/wk, respectively; SEM = 1,247), and DENS-EX heifers had more (P &lt; 0.01) steps per week compared with DENS. No treatment effects (P ≥ 0.91) were detected for heifer BW gain (~0.820 kg/d). Hair cortisol concentrations were greater (P ≤ 0.05) in DENS and DENS-EX compared with CON beginning on day 56. Exit velocity and temperament score were greater (P ≤ 0.05) in DENS compared with DENS-EX and CON on day 224. Puberty attainment was delayed (treatment × day; P &lt; 0.01) in DENS compared with DENS-EX and CON.

Although muscle strength, muscle quality, and physical performance have been suggested as important assessments in the screening, prevention, and management of sarcopenic and cachexic individuals, skeletal muscle size is still a critical objective marker. Several techniques exist for estimating skeletal muscle size; however, each technique presents with unique characteristics regarding simplicity/complexity, cost, radiation dose, accessibility, and portability that are important factors for assessors to consider before applying these modalities in practice. This narrative review presents a discussion centred on the theory and applications of current non‐invasive techniques for estimating skeletal muscle size in diverse populations. Common instruments for skeletal muscle assessment include imaging techniques such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, peripheral quantitative computed tomography, dual‐energy X‐ray absorptiometry, and Brightness‐mode ultrasound, and non‐imaging techniques like bioelectrical impedance analysis and anthropometry. Skeletal muscle size can be acquired from these methods using whole‐body and/or regional assessments, as well as prediction equations. Notable concerns when conducting assessments include the absence of standardised image acquisition/processing protocols and the variation in cut‐off thresholds used to define low skeletal muscle size by clinicians and researchers, which could affect the accuracy and prevalence of diagnoses.

Here, 1-methyl-pseudouridine-modified mRNA vaccines formulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNP) were developed against MARV and the closely-related Ravn virus (RAVV), which were based on sequences of the glycoproteins (GP) of the two viruses. Vaccination of guinea pigs with both vaccines elicited robust binding and neutralizing antibodies and conferred complete protection against virus replication, disease and death. The study characterized antibody responses to identify disparities in the binding and functional profiles between the two viruses and regions in GP that are broadly reactive. For the first time, the glycan cap is highlighted as an immunoreactive site for marburgviruses, inducing both binding and neutralizing antibody responses that are dependent on the virus. Profiling the antibody responses against the two viruses provided an insight into how antigenic differences may affect the response towards conserved GP regions which would otherwise be predicted to be cross-reactive and has implications for the future design of broadly protective vaccines. The results support the use of mRNA-LNPs against pathogens of high consequence.","https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4087897/v1",""

Employing the latest computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling techniques, this study investigates the importance of temperature and chemistry for ignition of the main chamber, with an emphasis on eliminating unburned methane. The sensitivity of the ignition and complete combustion to main chamber air/fuel mixture homogeneity was also explored. This study compares the effect of purely thermal ignition, purely chemical ignition, and how their interplay can influence the complete combustion of methane in typical mixtures and in homogeneous distributions of fuel in the combustion chamber. The CFD results demonstrated that temperature and chemistry are equally important in the ignition mechanism, and combining the two phenomena is effective at igniting the main chamber. Reduction of residual methane in the main combustion chamber (MCC) is most effective when chemical intermediates and thermal ignition are combined. A rudimentary analysis of the effect of fuel/air stratification was also conducted, and it demonstrated that a dramatic reduction in methane emissions is observed for homogeneous mixtures. The flow field in the main combustion chamber was shown to create detrimental stratification of the fuel/air mixture, which inhibited complete combustion of the methane in the main chamber. By contrast, in the extreme case of a perfectly homogeneous distribution of both chemical intermediates and fuel in the combustion chamber, it is possible to completely eliminate unburned methane in the main combustion chamber.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/gasturbinespower/article-pdf/146/10/101009/7341371/gtp_146_10_101009.pdf",""

But IMF officials also spend a large amount of time conducting routine surveillance through Article IV consultations, which assess a country’s economic developments and provide non-binding recommendations. Do governments follow this “toothless” advice? To answer this question, we examine the content of all Article IV staff appraisals published between 2004 and 2019. Using text analysis and a difference-in-differences estimator, we find that resource-rich developing countries are more likely to adopt legislation reforming the oil, gas, and mining sectors in the wake of an Article IV appraisal that extensively discusses the natural resource sector and recommends natural resource governance reforms. Our results suggest that technocratic advice—a tool often overlooked in international organization scholarship—can lead to the adoption of policies that help ameliorate the resource curse.","https://academic.oup.com/isq/article-pdf/68/2/sqae048/57124778/sqae048.pdf",""

We conducted two experimental studies to examine these relationships, where participants watched “Clouds Over Sidra” a VR film for the United Nations. The participants in the VR condition watched the documentary using VR, while in the non-VR condition, participants watched the documentary on a computer. Our results indicate a complex picture. It seems that VR technology can increase empathy and sympathy in participants, which can lead to a higher intention to donate. However, when we tested the relationship with political ideology as a moderator, empathy did not hold. In a moderated mediation model, we found that VR technology increased sympathy, which led to higher intention to donate. This relationship was moderated by political ideology, such that self-reported liberals scored high on donation intention in both the VR and non-VR groups. However, among conservatives, participants in the VR condition showed higher intention to donate.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/14614448241247209",""

Shear also impacts the size of supercell updrafts, with stronger shear leading to wider, less dilute, and stronger updrafts with likely greater hydrometeor production. To more clearly define the role of shear across different vertical layers on hydrometeor concentrations and displacements relative to supercell updrafts, a suite of idealized numerical model simulations of supercells was conducted. Shear magnitudes were systematically varied across the 0–1 km, 1–6 km, and 6–12 km AGL layers while the thermodynamic environment was held fixed. Simulations show that as shear magnitude increases, especially from 1–6 km, updrafts become wider and less dilute with an increase in hydrometeor loading, along with an increase in the low-level precipitation area/rate and total precipitation accumulation. Even with greater updraft hydrometeor loading amid stronger shear, updrafts are more intense in stronger shear simulations due to larger thermal buoyancy owing to wider, less dilute updraft cores. Furthermore, downshear hydrometeor displacements are larger in environments with stronger 1–6 km shear. In contrast, there is relatively less sensitivity of hydrometeor concentrations and displacements to variations in either 0–1 km or 6–12 km shear. Results are consistent across free tropospheric relative humidity sensitivity simulations, which show an increase in updraft size and hydrometeor mass with increasing free tropospheric relative humidity owing to a reduction in entrainment-driven dilution for wider updrafts in moister environments.","https://journals.ametsoc.org/downloadpdf/journals/mwre/aop/MWR-D-23-0166.1/MWR-D-23-0166.1.xml",""

The goal of NBQA Phase I is to evaluate what needs to be managed to improve beef quality and demand. Interviews (n = 130) of industry personnel were conducted with the aid of routing software. In total, packers (n = 24), retailers (n = 20), further processors (n = 26), foodservice (n = 18), and allied government agencies and trade organizations (n = 42) were interviewed. Interviews were routed in software based on interviewee involvement in either the fed steer and heifer market cow and bull sectors, or both. Interviews were structured to elicit random responses in the order of determining “must-have” criteria (quality factors that are required to make a purchase), best/worst ranking (of quality factors based on importance), how interviewees defined quality terms, a strength, weakness, opportunities, threats (SWOT) analysis, general beef industry questions, and sustainability goals (the latter four being open-ended). Quality factors were 1) visual characteristics, 2) cattle genetics, 3) food safety, 4) eating satisfaction, 5) animal well-being, 6) weight and size, and 7) lean, fat, and bone. Best/worst analysis revealed that “food safety” was the most (P &lt; 0.05) important factor in beef purchasing decisions for all market sectors and frequently was described as “everything” and “a way of business.” Culture surrounding food safety changed compared to previous NBQAs with interviewees no longer considering food safety as a purchasing criterion, but rather as a market expectation. The SWOT analysis indicated that “eating quality of U.S. beef” was the greatest strength, and cited that educating both consumers and producers on beef production would benefit the industry. Irrespective of whether companies’ products were fed or market cow/bull beef, respondents said that they believed “environmental concerns” were among the major threats to the industry. Perceived image of the beef industry in the market sectors has improved since NBQA-2016 for both fed cattle and market cow/bull beef.","https://academic.oup.com/tas/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/tas/txae034/56945832/txae034.pdf",""

Nevertheless, the impacts of using modularization along with advanced technologies, such as process intensification, have not yet been fully realized, often due to the uncertain business risks associated with their implementation. Therefore, new methods are needed for quantifying the impact of modular chemical process intensification (MCPI) on the capital and operating costs of chemical plants to help build a business case for this novel approach. This article presents a new conceptual range estimation technique for total cost of ownership that addresses the deficiencies of existing methods for quantifying MCPI impacts. The incorporation of percentage range estimates was employed to allow for adaptability across various cost and size scales. This work also begins to elucidate how chemical engineering and construction firms can benefit from MCPI and identifies barriers that inhibit MCPI applications in the chemical industry.","https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/am-pdf/10.1002/amp2.10176",""

Results: Participants in the AS + K? condition reported significantly greater gatekeeper preparedness and self-efficacy, and lower stigmatized attitudes at posttraining, as compared with those in the comparison condition. There were no significant differences in likelihood of using gatekeeper skills or suicide-related knowledge across groups. Limitations: This short-term study was not able to assess behavioral change resulting in use of gatekeeper skills over time. Conclusions: Completion of gatekeeper training resulted in increases in preparedness and self-efficacy for engaging in gatekeeper behaviors, as well as a reduction in suicide-related stigma.

Most ESMs assume positive correlations among soil nitrogen supply, leaf nitrogen content, and photosynthetic capacity. However, leaf photosynthetic nitrogen demand may influence the leaf nitrogen response to soil nitrogen supply, thus responses to nitrogen supply are expected to be largest in environments where demand is greatest. Using a nutrient addition experiment replicated at 26 sites spanning four continents, we demonstrated that climate variables were stronger predictors of leaf nitrogen content than soil nutrient supply. Leaf nitrogen increased more strongly with soil nitrogen supply in regions with highest theoretical leaf nitrogen demand, increasing more in colder and drier environments than warmer and wetter ones. Thus, leaf nitrogen responses to nitrogen supply are primarily influenced by climatic gradients in photosynthetic nitrogen demand, an insight that will improve ESM predictions.","",""

Controlled pore glass (CPG), ordered mesoporous carbons, and mesoporous silica are used as confinement media with pore sizes from 2 to 8 nm. The initial polymerization rate in CPG and mesoporous silica increases relative to the bulk and increases linearly with reciprocal pore size; whereas, the rate in the carbon mesopores decreases linearly with reciprocal pore size; the changes are consistent with the rate being related to the ratio of the pore surface area to pore volume. Induction times are longer for nanoconfined polymerizations, and in the case of CPG and carbon mesopores, autoacceleration occurs earlier, presumably due to the limited diffusivity and lower termination rates for the confined polymer chains. The molecular weight of the polymer synthesized in the nanopores is generally higher than that obtained in the bulk except at the lowest temperatures investigated. The equilibrium conversion under nanoconfinement decreases with decreasing temperature and with confinement size, exhibiting what appears to be a floor temperature at low temperatures.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/pol.20230332",""

Using data on 257 international crises from 1949–2001 and two case studies, we find robust evidence for the conditional relationship between co-ethnicity, the domestic political salience of ethnicity, executive constraints, and the likelihood of military coalition formation.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/07388942231220008",""

In this paper, we present a preliminary study of the controlled intermittent dispensing of a typical non-Newtonian glue employed in the manufacturing of electric vehicles (EVs). The focus of the study is on the scaling issues derived from different computational and analytical models of interest and importance to the precision control of this non-Newtonian fluid, the lowest dynamic viscosity of which at extremely high shear rates is nearly four million times that of water. More specifically, the abrupt change of the inlet pressure with a constant outlet or ambient pressure and various modeling strategies for transient viscous internal flow with both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids are modeled and compared. The analytical and computational results of the developing Newtonian fluid, i.e., water, are derived and computed for validation and verification purposes before the actual applications to the developing non-Newtonian fluid. The concept of a well-established relaxation time before the onset of the steady solution for Newtonian fluids has been validated with both analytical and computational approaches before its expansion and adoption to non-Newtonian fluids with complex rheological behaviors. Other issues attributed to transient operations and precision controls of non-Newtonian fluid delivery involve the pressure pulse and pressure wave propagation within the flexible pipe with compressible or almost incompressible non-Newtonian fluids with a constant pressure at the outlet and a constant mass flow rate or average axial velocity at the inlet, which will be addressed in a separate paper.","https://www.mdpi.com/2311-5521/9/7/165/pdf",""

One common approach that has been implemented to reduce these rates is abstinence‐only‐until‐marriage programs that advocate for delaying sexual intercourse until marriage. These programs focus on changing adolescents' beliefs toward abstinence until marriage; however, it is unclear whether adolescents' beliefs about abstinence predict their sexual behavior, including sexual risk behavior (SRB). An alternative approach may be encouraging youth to delay their sexual debut until they reach the age of maturity, but not necessarily until marriage. Methods: To address this question, we compare the longitudinal association between abstinence beliefs (i.e., abstaining completely until marriage) and beliefs about delayed sexual debut with subsequent SRB 24 months later. The harmonized data set included 4620 (58.2% female, Results: We identified that beliefs supporting delaying sex until an age of maturity were associated with lower odds of engaging in SRB, such as having multiple sex partners and frequency of condomless sex, for both sexes.

Each year, in a highly competitive process, managers from different functional units of the firm submit proposals (that include estimated costs and benefits) for such projects. Managers, because of their domain knowledge and expertise, are naturally better informed about the costs and benefits of their respective projects and can use this information strategically to secure funding. An example of such behavior is the under-reporting of the cost estimate of a project and subsequently requesting additional funding during the execution phase. Such strategic behavior not only affects the firm’s ability to fund the best projects but is also costly. Motivated by this challenge of deciding the funding of such projects at a global agribusiness firm, we seek a mechanism that is both provably near-optimal for the firm and guarantees truthful reporting from managers. Our setting consists of a principal and multiple agents. In each time period, over an infinite horizon, each agent requests funding for a potential project from the principal. Before submitting his proposal, each agent privately estimates the project’s cost and its benefit. If funded, each project is executed in one period. The principal’s funding decisions are binary; that is, each project is either funded in full or not funded. The actual cost (benefit) of a funded project is realized on its completion and incurred (earned) by the principal. The agents earn utility from the experience and reputation gained in completing projects. In each period, the principal desires to keep the total spend below a budget but can borrow external money at a cost. Our main contribution is a practically appealing dynamic nonmonetary mechanism for internal capital allocation under which, for any [Formula: see text], (a) truth-telling forms an ϵ-Bayesian Nash equilibrium and (b) the principal’s expected utility is within ϵ of the expected utility in the first-best setting.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01121",""

High‐quality long‐sequencing reads, for example, PacBio HiFi reads, provide data to detect macrohaplotypes in multiploidy and DNA mixtures. However, the bioinformatics tools for detecting macrohaplotypes are lacking. In this study, we developed a bioinformatics software, MacroHapCaller, in which targeted loci (i.e., short TRs [STRs], single nucleotide polymorphisms, and insertion and deletions) are genotyped and combined with novel algorithms to call macrohaplotypes from long reads. MacroHapCaller uses physical phasing (i.e., read‐backed phasing) to identify macrohaplotypes, and thus it can detect multi‐allelic macrohaplotypes for a given sample. MacroHapCaller was validated with data generated from our designed targeted PacBio HiFi sequencing pipeline, which sequenced ∼8‐kb amplicon regions harboring 20 core forensic STR loci in human benchmark samples HG002 and HG003. MacroHapCaller also was validated in whole‐genome long‐read sequencing data. Robust and accurate genotyping and phased macrohaplotypes were obtained with MacroHapCaller compared with the known ground truth. MacroHapCaller achieved a higher or consistent genotyping accuracy and faster speed than existing tools HipSTR and DeepVar.

We extend two small-amplitude base modes, one with orbital and spin motions that are in phase and the other out of phase, to finite amplitudes and show that the motion for arbitrary oscillatory solutions can be considered to be a nonlinear superposition of these base modes. Some solutions are pure periodic finite-amplitude extensions of one base mode, while others are hybrid finite-amplitude superpositions of the two modes. Hybrid modes with rational frequency ratios are periodic and come in families defined by their frequency ratios. We further characterize hybrid periodic modes by identifying two symmetry classes that describe their relative phases. We see continuous transitions between one finite-amplitude base mode and the other, with one mode gradually transforming into the other. We also calculate frequency spectra of nonperiodic modes, show that the two base modes have well-defined frequencies even for nonperiodic states, and show that periodic solutions can give clues about the behavior of nearby nonperiodic solutions. In the limit of small amplitudes, we confirm that the computed frequencies of these modes agree with small-amplitude analytical results. We also generate a Lyapunov exponent heatmap that reflects periodic and nonperiodic regions of state space.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/cha/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/5.0168791/19969194/053137_1_5.0168791.pdf",""

We compile a data set of per capita advertising expenditure to investigate advertising’s relationship with life satisfaction within 76 countries from 2006 to 2019. We deal with several sources of endogeneity and account for other determinants of life satisfaction (e.g., gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, social support) in our analysis. Results from a within-country fixed-effect model indicate that per capita advertising expenditure is positively related to national average life satisfaction. Moderation analyses of this aggregate secondary data and two individual-level experiments provide mechanistic evidence that this occurs because of advertising’s ability to reduce marketplace uncertainty. However, supplemental analyses and an additional experiment indicate that this positive relationship is attenuated through a materialism pathway in certain situations (e.g., related to cultural, income, and subjective inequality factors) and can become negative. As such, we provide the first nuanced and multifaceted view of advertising’s complex relationship with life satisfaction in the marketing literature.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mksc.2021.0136",""

Flavolac (Agroceres Multimix; Rio Claro, Sao Paulo, Brazil) is a commercial product containing several compounds, including amino acids, antioxidants, botanicals, direct fed-microbials, and vitamin-like compounds, that individually have previously been shown to improve litter weaning weight or preweaning mortality. However, there are no published data on the benefit when these compounds are used in combination. The experiment was conducted at a commercial sow farm located in northwest Texas. At approximately d 112 to 114 of gestation, sows were moved to the farrowing house, and randomly allotted to 1 of 2 treatments based on parity and caliper score. Treatments consisted of a control diet (no Flavolac) or the control diet with an added Flavolac top-dress (80 g/d in a single feeding). Sows were weighed before entering the farrowing house and at weaning. Sows were provided approximately 1.8 kg per day of a common lactation diet without Flavolac pre-farrowing. After farrowing, sows were provided ad libitum access to lactation feed. Application of treatments began after cross fostering, approximately 24 h post-farrowing. The weaning age averaged approximately 21.3 d. There was no evidence of differences (P &gt; 0.10) in sow body weight (BW) at entry, weaning, or overall BW change (Table). There was no evidence of differences (P &gt; 0.10) for sow entry caliper, weaning caliper score, caliper score change, or average daily lactation feed disappearance. In addition, there was no evidence of differences (P &gt; 0.10) in total litter or piglet birth weight. However, administration of Flavolac tended (P &lt; 0.10) to increase litter weaning weight, total litter weight gain, and litter average daily gain. The inclusion of Flavolac led to a tendency (P = 0.091) for a reduction in pre-weaning mortality and therefore, an improvement in percentage of pigs weaned relative to those on d 2. In summary, inclusion of Flavolac during the lactation period resulted in a tendency for reduced pre-weaning mortality and tended to improve total litter weight gain, and thus litter weight at weaning.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/102/Supplement_2/306/57404207/skae102.347.pdf",""

We develop a moral hazard model with multiple principal-agent pairs facing an external monitor who allocates resources across firms to verify earnings management. With such scrutiny allocation, contracts exhibit externalities that create a coordination problem among principals. Contract disclosure enables principals to design the contract anticipating the monitor’s reaction. However, it may also exacerbate the coordination problem among principals because they do not consider externalities on other principals caused by the effects of their contract choices on the monitor’s scrutiny allocation. If internal controls are relatively weak, contract disclosure may make contracts more strongly contingent on reported earnings, increase earnings manipulation, and nevertheless increase social welfare. Contract disclosure improves firm value only if the scrutiny resources available to the monitor are not strongly constrained.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article-pdf/99/2/169/105068/i0001-4826-99-2-169.pdf",""

Drawing on the resource‐based dynamic model for retirement adjustment and conservation of resources theory, the current study aims to elaborate theory on resources' types, relative importance and combinations in caravans, and the processes through which they shape successful retirement adjustment. In a consensual qualitative research using abductive reasoning with recent retirees aged 66–69, we find four major resource types. We show that their importance varies (from the most important to the least: social interactions, life conditions, time management and individuality) and that they travel in caravans within a resource type.

Overall, our findings offer theoretical and empirical contributions to the resource perspective on retirement adjustment and to conservation of resources theory's understanding of resources' categorization, processes and caravans.","",""

We use an expansive retail scanner dataset, along with unique data on apple taste characteristics, to estimate monthly club apple premiums for 2008–2018. We find that club apple premiums are around 29% and have consistently decreased from 35% in 2008 to 22% in 2018. Positive club apple premiums relate to consumers' preferences for juicier, more acidic, and sweeter apples. We do not find evidence that consumers place value on the exclusivity of purchasing more expensive and limited varieties. Hence club premiums exist in the market by meeting the demand of consumer segments for apples with distinct taste attributes rather than replacing the demand of traditional consumers who prefer open varieties. We use a vector error correction framework to find short‐run and long‐run determinants of club apple premiums. In the short run, the sales of club varieties may positively associate with the sales of open varieties, given the premium and cost factors. However, in the long run, there is a negative cointegrated relationship between club apple sales, open apple sales, and club apple premiums; and an increase in club apple sales is adversely related to the open apple sales and club premiums. The high initial premiums of protected club varieties have provided incentives for the development of uniquely differentiated apple varieties, while in the long term as production expands, premiums decrease making club varieties less expensive for consumers [EconLit Citations: L66, Q11].","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/agr.21937",""

We analyze how the extent of MLP employment used by a hospital is associated with hospital operational outcomes, as reflected by hospital cost per discharge and Triple Aim Performance (TAP) efficiency metrics. Our findings indicate percent MLP usage is positively associated with efficiency metrics for hospital clinical quality, technical efficiency, and patient experience, but not associated with hospital costs. We also find percent MLP usage is associated with the likelihood that hospitals excel on all TAP metrics simultaneously. Post‐hoc exploratory analyses suggest the associations exhibit differential outcomes across hospital efficiency quantiles, while sub‐sample analyses motivate boundary conditions for some hypothesized MLP associations. We contribute to healthcare OM research by providing one of the first panel data analyses of MLPs, improving insights relative to extant work.

The current study investigates the predictive validity of the TRAS screener and full versions when examining supervision compliance and recidivism among a sample of 462 individuals on probation. Findings support predictive validity of incarceration due to rule violations and new offenses during supervision using the TRAS versions, along with the domains of the TRAS-CST version, although the effect sizes were small to moderate.

A survey was administered to a target audience of non-Spanish speaking and bilingual animal professionals to identify communication gaps while interacting with Hispanic/Spanish-speaking animal caretakers. The data was analyzed with descriptive and inferential statistics, including ordinal regression analyses to examine the impact of demographic variables on respondents’ answer choices. The results showed that English-speaking professionals struggled with written and oral communication, which differed compared to bilingual professionals (p < 0.05). Additionally, responses of female professionals varied regarding the aspects of Spanish necessary for interacting with Hispanic/Spanish-speaking animal caretakers, as well as the topics likely to be addressed when agriculture professionals communicate with animal caretakers (p < 0.05). Communication difficulties in the oral medium for both oral receptive skills (listening) and oral productive skills (speaking) were reported as the major barriers that animal professionals need to overcome in their attempt to communicate with the Hispanic/Spanish-speaking workforce in farm settings. This emphasizes the need to address oral communication barriers, and to a lesser degree, the development of reading and writing skills. The topics: typical clinical signs of illness, euthanasia, treatment—drugs, and identification of sick or injured animals were identified as the most likely to be addressed during on-farm interactions. These findings indicate that there are gaps in communication that need to be overcome to improve communication with on-farm Hispanic/Spanish-speaking animal caretakers and consequently contribute to enhancing animal health, welfare, and production.","https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/14/4/624/pdf",""

Methods: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted with adult cancer survivors (≥18 years old) from Cycles 2, 3, and 4 of the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS). The respondents self-reported OHIS, and the data on the five health behaviors were pooled to perform descriptive and multivariable logistic regression analyses using Stata 17.0. Results: Of the 1245 adult cancer survivors, approximately 74% reported OHIS behavior for themselves within the previous year of the survey. We found that OHIS was significantly and positively associated with the level of physical activity (odds ratio [OR] = 1.53, p = .002) and calorie checking (OR = 1.64, p = .001), but not with sedentary behavior, smoking, and alcohol consumption after adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, income, body mass index (BMI), marital status, depression, and general health. Conclusions: Findings from this study suggest that most cancer survivors used various forms of digital tools and platforms to seek health information. The study also demonstrated an independent impact of OHIS behavior on physical activity and calorie checking. Healthcare professionals may need to encourage and guide cancer survivors to seek credible eHealth information and further utilize digital health tools as a platform for care delivery, promoting health behaviors and preventing adverse health outcomes among cancer survivors.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/20552076241238074",""

We examine conditions under which a clean PCAOB inspection finding (at the engagement level) provides auditor liability protection for an audit subsequently called into question. Using source credibility theory, we predict and find that the defense introducing a clean PCAOB inspection finding for the litigated engagement reduces jurors’ negligence assessments by increasing the perceived credibility of the firm’s defense. We also find that, if the plaintiff introduces a PCAOB-issued control criticism (firm-wide level), jurors’ negligence assessments increase, regardless of whether a clean PCAOB inspection finding for the engagement is present. Collectively, results suggest that PCAOB inspection findings influence jurors’ negligence assessments. These findings have implications for audit firms, the PCAOB, and other public policy makers, as well as attorneys and triers of fact in audit litigation.","https://publications.aaahq.org/ajpt/article-pdf/doi/10.2308/AJPT-2022-053/108830/ajpt-2022-053.pdf",""

But less is known about the clandestine collaborations between residents and agents of the state and how those collaborations might contribute to violence. This study draws on ethnographic fieldwork and an original legal archive to analyze the links between police collusion with drug market groups and interpersonal violence. We find that 1) police provide their collaborators with powerful weapons and ammunition; 2) state agents become involved and help escalate violent territorial disputes between underground market groups; and 3) violence erupts between state agents colluding with civilian dealers and those attempting to disrupt the drug trade. These findings shed new light on the social and organizational factors shaping patterns of violence in poor neighborhoods, illuminating the ways that state agents contribute to that violence. In doing so, the findings advance our understanding of policing, drug markets, and the role of the state in shaping the everyday lives of the urban poor.","https://academic.oup.com/socpro/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/socpro/spae035/58364860/spae035.pdf",""

Boards often authorize remedial continuing medical education (CME) as part of a disciplinary action; however, it is unclear how effective remedial CME is in reducing the likelihood of physicians receiving additional discipline. This study examined the relationship between physicians who were required to complete remedial CME as part of their first discipline by state medical boards and the likelihood of additional discipline. Method: The national-level sample included 4,061 MD-physicians whose first discipline included license restrictions, probation, or other conditions imposed by state medical boards between 2011 and 2015.

Yet, research thus far has overlooked the possibility that differences between startups and established firms might also shape the diffusion of the knowledge that they build. This study abductively explores this conjecture in the context of solar energy by examining the extent to which the photovoltaic cell inventions that firms create spur subsequent inventions by other firms. In contrast with existing literature highlighting differences across firms in the types of inventions they create, this study reveals asymmetries between startups and established firms in the diffusion of the knowledge underlying their inventions, even when they create inventions with similar attributes. Managerial Summary: This study examines differences between startups and established firms in shaping knowledge diffusion in a nascent industry. Using data from photovoltaic cell patents, it shows that startups' inventions spur more subsequent inventions by other firms, even when compared to established firms' inventions with similar attributes. Findings indicate that such asymmetry is not driven by knowledge transfer mechanisms but rather by factors associated with knowledge spillovers. Specifically, findings reveal that university citations of a startup's patents draw other firms' attention to those patents, and that startups are less able to preempt rivals through cumulative inventions and less able to rely on litigiousness to deter rivals from building on their patents. These findings underscore the asymmetric influence startups have in shaping the knowledge underlying a nascent industry.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/smj.3568",""

While there is limited research in consumer psychology on chronotypes, one question may be asked: Would they gain from the experiential advantage (where people elicit greater happiness from experiential vs. material purchases) and become happier? We find that evening types, in fact, elicit lower levels of happiness from their experiential purchases compared to morning types and, in effect, feel happier from their material purchases. Furthermore, this is because of the greater subjective distance they feel from their experiential purchases. This research contributes to our understanding of long‐term happiness in a significant section of society—evening types and also calls on researchers to explore the topic of evening chronotype happiness and well‐being in greater depth from a marketing perspective.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/mar.22062",""

Hannan, Rankin, and Towry (2006, “HRT”) develop a nuanced theory regarding the effect of information asymmetry on slack. The authors provide evidence that suggests increasing the precision of a superior’s information system, thereby reducing information asymmetry, can increase slack. We develop a refined version of HRT’s theory by incorporating evidence of how nonpecuniary incentives affect subordinates’ reporting slack from research subsequent to HRT. Our updated theory predicts that slack decreases as information system precision increases, opposite to the results in HRT. To test our refined theory, we replicate HRT’s experiment and find results consistent with our theory. Our results support HRT’s general theory but highlight the importance of establishing regularities of how nonpecuniary incentives affect behavior in accounting. Specifically, our updated theory and new evidence suggest that improving information system precision decreases budgetary slack, contrary to the results suggested in HRT.","https://publications.aaahq.org/jmar/article-pdf/36/1/73/104554/i1049-2127-36-1-73.pdf",""

Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured interviews were employed to elucidate data from teachers, counselors, and leaders in a U.S. Midwestern suburban community that had recorded a significant increase in the number of refugee students. Findings: The findings identified that suburban districts do not usually have the cultural experience or training on how to best serve their refugee students. Indeed, prior to the pandemic, most participants were culturally blind or pre-competent. However, the pandemic afforded participants an opportunity to learn about their refugee students’ cultures. The evidence of the current research suggests that cultural proficiency should constitute an integral part of leadership’s crisis management plans. Originality: The emotions that develop in a teacher’s working environment at a time of crisis, as well as their levels of emotional engagement, are two important factors that affect a school’s functioning. As such, this work recognizes the need to exercise empathy when addressing vulnerable students’ needs. Furthermore, this work recognizes that a school leader exhibiting awareness and empathy will help the teachers of that school to improve their effectiveness in exercising empathy.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/27526461241227970",""

For early-stage TNBC (eTNBC), less representation of this subtype in cohorts studied to date has limited interpretation of results. We sought to evaluate outcomes according to HER2 IHC in a multi-institutional cohort of patients (pts) with eTNBC who received neoadjuvant therapy (NAT). Methods: Pts diagnosed with stage I-III TNBC (including HR-low; ER and PR &lt; 10%) who received NAT and underwent surgery between 1/1/16-6/30/19 were identified across three institutional prospective databases. HER2 was defined as low (1+ or 2+/ISH non-amplified) or HER2-0 according to local testing at diagnosis. Pathological complete response (pCR) was defined as no residual invasive disease in breast and axilla. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare pCR rates (HER2-low vs HER2-0) adjusting for age at diagnosis, race, anatomic clinical stage, germline BRCA1/2 (gBRCA), histology, HR status and receipt of anthracycline and taxane NAT. Recurrence-free (RFS), distant recurrence-free (DRFS), and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios. Results: A total of 978 pts were identified of which 388 (39.7%) had HER2-low and 590 (60.3%) had HER2-0 tumors at diagnosis. Median age was 50.3 (range: 21.0-83.4) yrs. 174 (17.8%) pts had HR-low tumors. 142 (14.5%) pts had a known gBRCA mutation. 790 pts (80.8%) received anthracycline- and taxane NAT. No significant differences were observed in age, race, gBRCA, histology, HR status (low vs negative), clinical tumor size, or type of NAT between HER2-low and HER2-0 groups. Clinical nodal positivity was higher in HER2-low (55.2%) vs HER2-0 (46.6%), p=0.011. No significant difference in pCR was observed between HER2-low (32.0%) and HER2-0 (32.7%) groups, adjusted p=0.928. Among pts with residual disease (RD) post-NAT with HER2 IHC also available in the RD sample, 244/363 (67.2%) had concordant HER2 status. 70/225 (31.1%) of HER2-0 tumors at diagnosis had IHC expression post-NAT (66 HER2-low, 4 HER2-positive); 48/138 (34.8%) of HER2-low tumors at diagnosis were HER2-0 post-NAT. At a median follow-up of 3.1 yrs, RFS did not significantly differ between HER2-low vs HER2-0 pts with pCR (p=0.368) or in those with RD post-NAT (p=0.573). Similarly, DRFS did not differ according to HER2 category for pts with pCR (p=0.509) or RD (p=0.812), nor did OS for pts with pCR (p=0.514) or RD (p=0.285) (Table 1). Conclusion: In a large cohort of pts with eTNBC treated with NAT, HER2-low status was not associated with pCR or survival after adjusting for clinical factors. High rate of discordance in HER2 IHC between diagnostic and RD post-NAT was observed, highlighting the importance of repeat IHC testing in serial samples given the development of antibody drug conjugates for HER2-low breast cancer.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/84/9_Supplement/PO3-03-05/744106/Abstract-PO3-03-05-Clinical-outcomes-in-early",""

(i) Capacity is substantially more flexible in the sense that changes to the capacity of a train can often be made throughout the sales horizon. Consequently, the joint optimization of prices and capacity assumes genuine importance. (ii) Capacity can only be added in discrete “chunks” (i.e., coaches). (iii) Passengers with unreserved tickets can travel in any of the multiple trains available during the day. Further, passengers in unreserved coaches are allowed to travel by standing, thus giving rise to the need to manage congestion. Motivated by our work with a major railway company in Japan, we analyze the problem of jointly optimizing pricing and capacity; this problem is more-general version of the canonical multiproduct dynamic-pricing problem. Methodology/results: Our analysis yields four asymptotically optimal policies. From the viewpoint of the pricing decisions, our policies can be classified into two types—static and dynamic. With respect to the timing of the capacity decisions, our policies are again of two types—fixed capacity and flexible capacity. We establish the convergence rates of these policies; when demand and supply are scaled by a factor [Formula: see text], the optimality gaps of the static policies scale proportional to [Formula: see text], and those of the dynamic policies scale proportional to [Formula: see text]. We illustrate the attractive performance of our policies on a test suite of instances based on real-world operations of the high-speed “Shinkansen” trains in Japan and develop associated insights. Managerial implications: Our work provides railway administrators with simple and effective policies for pricing, capacity, and congestion management. Our policies cater to different contingencies that decision makers may face in practice: the need for static or dynamic prices and for fixed or flexible capacity.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/msom.2022.0246",""

Both Kelvin’s and Maxwell’s viscoelastic models can be implemented along with the dynamic behaviors of a mass point attached to the viscoelastic model. By employing the time-dependent polished rod force measured with a dynamometer as the input to the viscoelastic dynamic model, we have obtained the displacement responses, which match closely with the experimental measurements in actual operations, through an iterative process. The key discovery of this work is the feasibility of the so-called inverse optimization procedure, which can be utilized to identify the equivalent scaling factor and viscoelastic system parameters. The proposed Newton–Raphson iterative method, with some terms in the Jacobian matrix expressed with averaged rates of changes based on perturbations of up to two independent parameters, provides a feasible tool for optimization issues related to complex engineering problems with mere information of input and output data from either experiments or comprehensive simulations. The same inverse optimization procedure is also implemented to model the entire fluid delivery system of a very viscous non-Newtonian polymer modeled as a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) system similar to the transient entrance developing flow. The convergent parameter reproduces transient solutions that match very well with those from fully fledged computational fluid dynamics models with the required inlet volume flow rate and outlet pressure conditions.","https://www.mdpi.com/2311-5521/9/6/136/pdf",""

Despite the fashion industry’s slow progress towards sustainability, clothing users have autonomy to shape their practice, which holds promise for reducing environmental impacts. There is a need to explore more critically various practices such as wear, care and repair habits that contribute to longevity within the consumer’s sphere of influence. Likewise, there is a need to transform educational perspectives in the field of sustainable consumption, as increased knowledge alone has been found insufficient to drive behavioural change. This study investigates the impact of short-term behavioural modification challenges (the ‘short game’) on users’ long-term consumption behaviour (the ‘long game’). Through a case study involving young female university students, this study characterizes the implementation of a lifestyle change towards sustainable clothing use practice and highlights its effects on long-term behaviour. This case illustrates an educational intervention that employed cognitive (head), affective (heart) and practical (hands) learning activities to advance specific competencies associated with sustainable consumption in the context of clothing use behaviours. The study provides a window into the logistical challenges, emotional longings and social pressures that young consumers must invariably reconcile to remain motivated and persist in the ‘long game’ of clothing longevity. By focusing learners’ attention on clothing use behaviours and providing some supportive conditions, young consumers can make meaningful and lasting changes to their practice.","https://intellectdiscover.com/content/journals/10.1386/sft_00039_1?crawler=true&mimetype=application/pdf",""

The purpose of this study was to understand implicit racial and ethnic bias in speech-language pathology students by examining their perceptions and attitudes about the acceptability of racial and ethnic microaggressions. We also examined whether the student ratings varied by their racial and ethnic identity (White vs. people of color [POC]). Method:: Fifty-nine students (72% White, 28% POC) currently enrolled in a speech-language pathology program voluntarily completed the Acceptability of Racial Microaggressions Scale via an online Qualtrics survey. Results:: Although 70% of the student ratings classified the microaggressive statements as unacceptable, 30% of their ratings classified the statements as either (a) acceptable or (b) neither acceptable nor unacceptable. Although both groups of students rated the majority of statements as unacceptable, students who self-identified as White rated more statements as acceptable than students who self-identified as POC. Conclusions:: Findings indicating relatively high rejection of microaggressive statements by speech-language pathology students are promising.

Therefore, there is a critical need for carefully designed, rigorously tested, multicomponent contextualized language interventions (CLIs) that have a high likelihood of successful implementation and measurable academic impacts. This clinical focus article summarizes the development and testing of a CLI entitled Supporting Knowledge in Language and Literacy (SKILL), which is a supplementary narrative intervention program for elementary school-age children. Our aims are to (a) to review the foundational theoretical models that are the foundation of SKILL; (b) describe the iterative process used to develop the phases, lessons, procedures, materials, and progress monitoring tool; (c) summarize recent findings of the randomized controlled trial that was conducted to test its efficacy; and (d) discuss factors that may contribute to successful implementation of multicomponent language interventions. Method:: A total of 357 students in Grades 1–4 with LLDs were randomized to a treatment group or to a business-as-usual control group. The treatment group received the SKILL curriculum in small groups during 30-min lessons by trained speech-language pathologists, teachers, and special educators. Results:: Students who received SKILL significantly outperformed those who did not on oral and written measures of storytelling and comprehension immediately after treatment and after 5-months at follow-up. Gains were similar among students with different levels of language ability (at-risk, language impaired) and language status (monolingual, bilingual) at pretest. Conclusions:: There is growing support for the use of multicomponent CLIs to bring about educationally relevant outcomes for students with LLDs. The authors present this review of how SKILL was designed, manualized, and rigorously tested by a team of researchers and practitioners with the hope that this approach will serve as a springboard for the development of future multicomponent CLIs that may meaningfully improve communicative and educational outcomes for students with LLDs.","https://pubs.asha.org/doi/pdf/10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00171",""

In contrast to other such experiences, workload represents a necessary aspect of employment that cannot be alleviated or removed. It also has both aversive and beneficial aspects; research, therefore, has aimed to examine the circumstances under which its negative effects can be alleviated while still maintaining its potential benefits for individuals and organizations. Such efforts, however, have had mixed success. In this paper, we propose a new way forward by examining the extent to which the concordance of individual expectations about daily workload and actually experienced workload is associated with aversive affective responses (with ultimate impacts of the latter for cross‐day functioning). We test these propositions in two daily studies and find that when experienced workload levels do not align with expectations, individuals experience higher levels of anxiety. Importantly, these effects of unexpected workload are overall stronger in magnitude than the effects of high but expected workload; furthermore, they operate through their impact on individuals’ sense of control. These workload patterns are further indirectly associated with next‐day functioning through sense of control and anxiety. Implications for theory and practice are discussed, together with directions for future research.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/peps.12640",""

A total of 240 Angus-influenced steers were used in this experiment that was replicated over 2 yr (120 steers/year). Each year, steers were obtained from an auction yard and transported to the experimental facility (120 km). Steer body weight (BW) was recorded at arrival (d -1), and this value was averaged with BW recorded on d 0 to represent initial BW (236.6 ± 1.5 kg). On d 0, steers were ranked by BW and allocated to 1 of 12 pastures with stockpiled native grass (4-ha pastures; 10 steers/pasture). Pastures were randomly assigned to receive daily supplementation with dried distillers’ grains at 1% of BW containing either: 1) Bacillus subtilis + B. licheniformis probiotic (BOV; 2 g/steer daily of Bovacillus™; Novonesis, Horsholm, Denmark) or 2) no feed additive (CON). Cattle received treatments from d 0 to 90, in addition to free-choice access to water and mineral + vitamin mix without ionophore. Steers were assessed for bovine respiratory disease (BRD) signs daily. Blood samples were collected and full BW was recorded on d 0, 14, 28, 56, and 90. Shrunk BW was recorded on d 91 after 16 h of feed and water restriction, and a 4% pencil shrink was used to calculate final BW. Average daily gain (ADG) was calculated based on initial and final BW. No treatment effects were detected (P ≥ 0.73) for steer final BW and ADG. A treatment × day interaction was detected (P ≤ 0.05) for plasma haptoglobin concentration, which was greater for CON steers on d 14 and 28 (P ≤ 0.02). Incidence of BRD signs did not differ (P = 0.97) between treatments (51.7 and 51.3% for BOV and CON, respectively; SEM = 7.70).

Collectively, supplementation with a probiotic based on B. subtilis and B. licheniformis to high-risk stocker cattle did not alleviate incidence of BRD signs nor improved ADG, but decreased acute-phase protein response, reduced steer mortality + removal, and increased pasture-based productivity during a 90-d grazing period.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jas/skae209/58647061/skae209.pdf",""

Milligram/kilogram values were available for 103 (15.4%) with median 42.4 mg/kg, IQR: 39 mg/kg. Most (647, 98.5%) exposures were unintentional. Most (445/669, 66.5%) were managed at a non-healthcare facility, while 204 (30.7%) were already at or referred to a healthcare facility. Of these 204 patients, 169 (82.8%) were evaluated and treated at the emergency department and discharged. Four (2%) were admitted to critical care, and 7 (3.4%) to the ward. Medical outcomes by effect were 5 (0.7%) minor, 2 (0.3%) moderate, 253 (37.8%) none, 292 (43.6%) not followed (minimal effects possible), and no major effects or deaths. Of 20 clinical occurrences reported, vomiting was most common (8, 1.2%). Conclusion: Despite little recorded dosage information, pediatric metformin ingestions under 85 mg/kg had predominantly uneventful medical outcomes.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/00185787241230628",""

Tg is found to be depressed relative to the bulk by 20 ± 2 K for 20 nm-diameter unsupported polystyrene (PS) nanorods at the slowest cooling rate and by 9 ± 1 K for 55 nm-diameter rods. On the other hand, bulk-like behavior is observed in the case of unsupported 350 nm-diameter nanorods and for all supported rods in AAO. The size-dependent Tg behavior of the PS unsupported nanorods compares well with results for ultrathin films when scaled using the volume/surface ratio. Enthalpy recovery was also studied for the 20 and 350 nm unsupported nanorods with evolution toward equilibrium found to be linear with logarithmic time. The rate of enthalpy recovery for the 350 nm rods was similar to that for the bulk, whereas the rate of recovery was enhanced for the 20 nm rods for down-jump sizes larger than 17 K.

Appeals to tolerance are expected to grow as the planet becomes more crowded, species are lost, and habitat is degraded. The concept has been uncritically adopted in wildlife conservation to mitigate human–wildlife conflicts (HWCs). However, scholars have demonstrated that tolerance is burdened with limitations, paradoxes, and shortcomings. Thus, blind adherence to it is not expected to produce a coexistence design necessary to sustain wildlife populations in the long term. This paper is a conceptual scoping project that engages a summary and critique of tolerance as a design principle within wildlife conservation governance. After introducing a resultant theory of dysfunctional human–wildlife coexistence, a pathway toward hospitality as a social institution is outlined via several commitments societies can make to transition to an era of normalizing a process of sincere welcoming, care, and support. The transition from tolerance to hospitality will entail shifting responsibility to humans to modify their behavior to help keep wildlife invisible where it is essential, learning about what wildlife want and need, and ensuring wildlife is not injured for being themselves.","https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/14/8/1185/pdf",""

A unique but extremely common habitat is the urban sidewalk and its cracks that collect detritus. While these habitats are ubiquitous across the globe, little to no work has been conducted to characterize protists found there. Amoeboid protists are major predators of bacteria and other microbial eukaryotes in these microhabitats and therefore play a substantial ecological role. From sidewalk crack soil crusts, we have isolated three naked amoebae with finely tapered subpseudopodia, and a simple life cycle consisting of a trophic amoeba and a cyst stage. Using a holistic approach including light, electron, and fluorescence microscopy as well as phylogenetics using the ribosomal small subunit rRNA gene and phylogenomics using 230 nuclear genes, we find that these amoeboid organisms fail to match any previously described eukaryote genus. However, we determined the amoebae belong to the amoebozoan lineage Variosea based on phylogenetics. The molecular analyses place our isolates in two novel genera forming a grade at the base of the variosean group Protosteliida.

These drugs induce muscle relaxation and reduce muscle spasms, and therefore, they are commonly used in surgical procedures involving muscle manipulation, such as abdominal surgery, breast surgery, and spine surgery. However, their analgesic efficacy and opioid-sparing effects are poorly explored. Methods:: A scoping review of literature was performed with several electronic databases. We used a search string with a sequence of text words and word variants related to central muscle relaxants, pain management, postoperative pain, and specific muscle relaxants. Results:: Review of literature shows significant heterogeneity among the studies in terms of surgical procedures, patient populations, choice of muscle relaxant, and timing and duration of administration, potentially limiting the generalizability of the findings and the ability for pooled analysis. Conclusions:: Given the lack of evidence, we recommend that the use of skeletal muscle relaxants be reserved for patients in whom an optimal multimodal analgesic technique is not adequate. Also, there may be a limited role for these drugs in patients at high risk of postoperative pain undergoing surgical procedures with expected high opioid requirements. Due to the concerns of potential adverse effects, the decision to use muscle relaxants in vulnerable populations should be made carefully, weighing the benefits against the risks.","https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/GOX.0000000000005938",""

We establish a formal framework and prove that no blockchain system can achieve α-partial verification for any fixed constant α, high scalability, and low finality-duration simultaneously. We observe that classical blockchain systems like Bitcoin achieve full verification (α =1) and low finality-duration, Ethereum 2.0 Sharding achieves low finality-duration and high scalability.

Objective: To examine current strategies, pharmacological, nonpharmacological, surgical procedures, virtual reality, and mirror therapy, and the evidence supporting them, in the management of phantom limb pain. Design: This study reviewed and analyzed transcripts acquired in nonresearch contexts from the Veterans Affairs Translational Education and Mentoring Center's commercialization training program and from a Veteran Engagement Panel. Key themes were extracted using quasi‐qualitative analysis of one‐on‐one interviews. Results: Clinicians and patients report that early patient intervention and education will yield improved management of phantom limb pain, which aligns with the growing recognition of the impact of patient‐centered care on overall treatment outcomes. Mirror therapy is viewed as an effective and low‐risk therapy, though compliance and buy‐in may be barriers to clinical practice. Patient engagement can contribute to better treatment adherence and outcomes. Conclusion: The study highlights implementation barriers, importance of end‐user input, and the role of the Veteran Engagement Panel in providing feedback to pain researchers.

While electronic cigarettes and other electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) were presented as a safer alternative to traditional cigarettes and promoted as devices to help traditional tobacco smokers reduce or quit smoking, they have instead contributed to increasing nicotine use among youths. Despite this, ENDS also represent a useful tool to create novel preclinical animal models of nicotine exposure that more accurately represent human nicotine use. In this study, we validated a chronic, intermittent, ENDS-based passive vapor exposure model in mice, and then measured changes in multiple behaviors related to nicotine abstinence. First, we performed a behavioral dose curve to investigate the effects of different nicotine inter-vape intervals on various measures including body weight, locomotor activity, and pain hypersensitivity. Next, we performed a pharmacokinetic study to measure plasma levels of nicotine and cotinine following chronic exposure for each inter-vape interval. Finally, we utilized a behavior test battery at a single dosing regimen that produces blood levels equivalent to human smokers in order to characterize the effects of chronic nicotine, vehicle, or passive airflow and identified nicotine-induced impairments in cognitive behavior.","https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3892315/v1",""

Through a content analysis of the relevant literature, we identified three themes: funding constraints, access and inclusion, and teacher education. Regarding funding, issues of resource allocation, technical capacity, and accountability were identified as primary factors requiring intervention strategies to become fully realized in SSA. When exploring access and inclusion, we found that incorporating students with disabilities, gender disparities, physical barriers, and inadequate curriculum are essential factors limiting quality education in SSA. Finally, teachers’ conditions and training emerged as crucial challenges to reach quality pedagogy. Some SSA countries have improved their efforts for quality education, but these barriers and challenges continue to impact education for all children. A new perspective on mitigating these impediments can address several factors responsible for the exclusion of diverse groups from accessing quality education in the SSA region.","https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/7/2657/pdf",""

The experiment was performed with four types of irrigation water using soil columns representing field soil layers. EMF-treated brackish water maintained a sodium adsorption ratio of 2.7 by leaching Na+ from the soil. EMF-treated irrigation columns showed an increase in soil organic carbon by 7% over no EMF-treated columns. Compost treatment reduced the leaching of NO3− from the soil by more than 15% using EMF-treated irrigation water. EMF-treated brackish water and compost treatment enhanced plant growth by increasing wet weight by 63.6%, dry weight by 71.4%, plant height by 22.8%, and root length by 115.8% over no EMF and compost columns.

Our model has three elements. First, we identify the potential costs of CEO succession planning, including opportunity costs associated with absorbing CEO and board attention, CEO-board conflict, and various forms of organizational disruption. Second, we identify and unpack the potential results of CEO succession planning, with explicit attention to the possibility that these results might be unfavorable. Specifically, expensively groomed executives may depart prior to succession; and groomed successors may perform no better, or even worse, than replacements obtained from the executive labor market, when needed. Third, we specify a slate of contingency conditions that substantially affect whether the various costs of CEO succession planning, and the likelihoods of unfavorable results, will be modest or considerable. We identify relevant contingencies at multiple levels: (a) incumbent CEO attributes, (b) firm attributes, (c) industry attributes, and (d) macro-environmental norms and institutions. No single contingency condition will necessarily make CEO succession planning an unpromising investment, but combinations might, prompting rational boards to balk at engaging in such endeavors. Our model has major implications for scholars, boards, governance watchdogs, and investors. Moreover, our analysis sheds indirect light on why many boards do not engage in CEO succession planning. It may not be due to their dereliction, as is typically asserted, but rather to their assessments that such initiatives do not make economic sense.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/orsc.2023.17781",""

This evaluation is conducted under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs) scenarios, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5. By using an envelope-based selection technique and a multi-objective distance-based approach, we identify four RGCM-runs per RCP representing diverse climatic conditions, including wet-warm, wet-cold, dry-warm, and dry-cold. Compared to the full-set, these selected runs show a decreased mean absolute error (MAE) between the reference and RGCM-runs concerning the monthly average mean air temperature (T̄) and precipitation (P̄). For RCP4.5, T̄ MAE is 0.45 (vs. 0.58 in the full-set) and P̄ MAE is 0.31 (vs. 0.42). For RCP8.5, T̄ MAE is 0.51 (vs. 0.75) and P̄ MAE is 0.25 (vs. 0.36). The lower MAE values in the RGCM-run set indicate closer alignment between predicted and reference values, making the RGCM-run suitable for climate impact assessments in the region.","https://iwaponline.com/jwcc/article-pdf/15/2/686/1376128/jwc0150686.pdf",""

Monthly‐level multivariate time series analyses employed data from 2013‐2022 and accounted for the relationship between crime, arrests, and the jail population. The expanded policy was hypothesized to increase certain property crimes based on the new guidelines, but results indicated the policy modification was associated with changes in citywide crime counts for one type of crime: homicide. Policy implications: Efforts around the United States to decarcerate the pre‐trial jail population should examine potential unintended consequences for public safety. The current study failed to detect a statistically significant increase in seven of the eight types of crime during the expanded use of one jail decarceration approach, police station citation release. In the future, jurisdictions looking to reduce their jail population might consider citation release as a speedy and cost‐effective alternative to release‐on‐recognizance, but they should take care to monitor individual defendants and evaluate their own program.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1745-9133.12659",""

Objective:: The purpose of this study was to review current literature on return-to-play data after hip arthroscopy and to provide clinicians with data to set proper expectations with patients. Data Sources:: The following terms were used to search PubMed and Embase electronic databases on October 18, 2023: hip, arthroscopy, arthroscopic, golf. Study Selection:: Studies were included if they were in the English language, of Level 1 to 4 evidence, and contained data specific to golfers undergoing hip arthroscopy. Studies were excluded if they did not designate participants as golfers or did not specify return-to-play data. Editorials, case reports, and review articles were excluded. Screening was completed by 2 authors in a blind and duplicate manner. Study Design:: Systematic review. Level of Evidence:: Level II. Data Extraction:: The following datapoints were extracted from each study: hip pathology and arthroscopic procedure data; number of players returning to golf and time from surgery to return; outcome score(s); and rehabilitation details. Descriptive statistics were calculated using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. Results:: The search returned 400 studies, of which 4 were included for analysis. Of these 4 studies, 2 specified return-to-play time. Of 95 golfers, 90 (94.7%) returned to golf successfully after arthroscopic hip surgery.

Conclusion:: Return to golf after hip arthroscopy is highly probable, with approximately 95% of patients throughout literature returning to play. A mean return time of 4.7 months for professional golfers and 7.2 months for amateurs, alongside improved subjective outcomes and performance metrics postsurgery, suggest patients can expect a relatively quick return to the course with similar or improved performance.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/19417381241235214",""

Lifestyle interventions to decrease obesity represent a potential approach to prevent obesity-associated PDAC. Here, we examined whether decreasing obesity through physical activity (PA) and/or dietary changes could decrease inflammation in humans and prevent obesity-associated PDAC in mice. Comparison of circulating inflammatory-associated cytokines in subjects (overweight and obese) before and after a PA intervention revealed PA lowered systemic inflammatory cytokines. Mice with pancreatic-specific inducible KrasG12D expression were exposed to PA and/or dietary interventions during and after obesity-associated cancer initiation. In mice with concurrent diet-induced obesity (DIO) and KrasG12D expression, the PA intervention led to lower weight gain, suppressed systemic inflammation, delayed tumor progression, and decreased pro-inflammatory signals in the adipose tissue. However, these benefits were not as evident when obesity preceded pancreatic KrasG12D expression. Combining PA with diet-induced weight loss (DI-WL) delayed obesity-associated PDAC progression in the genetically engineered mouse model, but neither PA alone nor combined with DI-WL or chemotherapy prevented PDAC tumor growth in orthotopic PDAC models regardless of obesity status. PA led to upregulation of IL-15ra in adipose tissue. Adipose-specific overexpression of IL-15 slowed PDAC growth but only in non-obese mice. Overall, our study suggests that PA alone or combined with DI-WL can reduce inflammation and delay obesity-associated PDAC development or progression. Lifestyle interventions that prevent or manage obesity or therapies that target weight loss-related molecular pathways could prevent progression of PDAC.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/doi/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-23-1045/3456667/can-23-1045.pdf",""

Study Design: We conducted a retrospective study estimating the effects of the ACA Marketplace using difference‐in‐difference regressions, with the main outcome being the uninsured discharge rate. We stratified our sample by patient's race, age, gender, urbanicity, major diagnostic categories (MDC), and emergent type of admissions. Data Collection/Extraction Methods: We used Texas hospital discharge records for non‐elderly adults collected by the state of Texas and included acute care hospitals who reported data from 2011 to 2019. Principal Findings: The expansion of insurance through ACA Marketplaces led to reductions in the uninsured discharge rate by 9.9% (95% CI, −17.5%, −2.3%) relative to the baseline mean. The effects of the ACA were felt strongest in counties with any share of Hispanic, in counties with a larger population of Black, and other racial groups, in counties with a significant share of female and older age individuals, in counties considered to be urban, in high‐volume diagnoses, and emergent type of admissions.

Reduced access to treatment is partially due to limited training opportunities. Web-based training resources are valuable because they are easily accessible, are cost-efficient, and can be reviewed by providers as needed. This presentation describes the development, testing, and launch of a web-based provider training for CBT-N. Methods: Nightmare, trauma, and sleep disorder experts collaborated to develop material for the web-based CBT-N training. Next, 17 providers tested a first draft of the web-site. After feedback was integrated, 50 providers were recruited to complete the updated draft of the website and will complete feedback in January 2024. To assess learning, providers completed multiple-choice questions before and after each of the 10 training modules. Item Response Theory (IRT) analyses were used to identify items of low discrimination and difficulty for further refinement. Results: Overall, testers had positive reactions to the training content and website. The training content was improved by adding more figures, animations, and therapy demonstration videos and integrating more cultural considerations. Usability was improved by addressing bugs and enhancing intuitive site navigation. Based on IRT analyses of multiple-choice questions, 40 (out of a total 80) items were replaced and will be re-evaluated at the conclusion of beta testing. Conclusion: Launching in June 2024, CBTnightmares.org is a comprehensive, engaging, and accessible training after two phases of development and feedback from almost 70 licensed providers. The final phase of testing, to be conducted in April 2024, will examine the equivalence of online training compared to a live virtual workshop (Target N = 100). Providers will complete questionnaires and a mock session with a standardized patient to examine therapist proficiency and fidelity. The hypotheses are that this web-based course will be equivalent to a live virtual workshop. This project directly addresses the dissemination and implementation cliff of empirically supported treatment for nightmares.

By using more stable forms of locomotion on higher substrates, primates might avoid potentially fatal consequences. Materials and Methods: Using high‐speed cameras, we recorded the quadrupedal locomotion of four wild lemur species— Results: Lemurs did not adjust stride frequency on substrates of varying height. Adjustments to speed, stride length, and the mean number of supporting limbs in response to varying height often ran counter to predictions. Only Discussion: Results suggest that quadrupedal walking is a relatively safe form of locomotion for lemurs, requiring subtle changes in gait to increase stability on higher—that is, potentially riskier—substrates.

The objectives of this study were to examine whether the utilization of financial planners, the status of inheritance receipt, and religion are associated with engagement in estate planning among U.S. Black adults, and how these associations vary based on life insurance policy ownership. Participants for this study were 673 U.S. Black adults aged 25 and older who completed an online survey in July 2021. We estimated logistic regression models to predict Black adults' engagement in estate planning. Results indicated that in fully adjusted models, Black adults who used the services of a financial planner had significantly higher odds of executing a valid will or trust than those who did not seek assistance from a financial planner. The status of inheritance receipt, frequency of attendance at religious services, and ownership of life insurance policies were positively and significantly associated with engagement in estate planning among Black adults. However, as a moderator, patterns did not differ significantly depending on whether they owned life insurance policies. These findings may assist professionals and other stakeholders in financial planning to develop strategies or interventions to enhance estate planning for U.S. Black households.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/cfp2.1181",""

We predict and find that such disclosure overlaps increase auditor liability, using audit fees as a proxy for auditor liability, and that (1) both the magnitude and explicitness of overlapped disclosure are positively associated with auditor liability and (2) analyst following, Top 10 auditors, and auditor tenure play a moderating role in the association between overlapped disclosures and auditors’ perceived liability.

Unfortunately, blood pregnancy tests simply provide a yes or no answer to pregnancy status. Multiparous ewes (n = 20) at the Arkansas State University Teaching and Research Center were enrolled in a study to evaluate whether lamb number or sex would impact commercial blood pregnancy test results. Weekly blood samples were collected, for a total of 5 blood samples during the breeding season (11/14/22, 11/21/22, 11/28/22, 12/5/22, and 12/12/22) ewes were followed through lambing to determine lamb number and sex. Whole blood samples were centrifuged at 2,000 x g and plasma harvested and stored at -20 C until analysis for pregnancy associated glycoproteins was completed. Plasma samples were analyzed using two commercially available blood pregnancy tests, Rapid Visual Pregnancy Test (RV plate) and OnFarm Pregnancy Test (SNAP). The RV Plate is a 96-well ELISA test that is designed to be interpreted visually by comparison with the positive (PC) and negative (NC) control wells. The RV Plate and SNAP tests were completed, and results interpreted by two technicians blind to pregnancy status using a scoring system (0 = same or less color than NC; 1 = slightly more color than NC; 2 = slightly less color than PC; 3 = same or more color than PC; 0 and 1 = not pregnant, 2 and 3 = pregnant) or by manufacturer’s instructions (SNAP). Lambing revealed a total of 18 female lambs and 13 male lambs born to the 20 ewes, furthermore, there were 6 singleton, 11 twins, and 1 set of triplets. Total score count results from the RV Plate indicate that as gestational age increased the number of 3 scores increased (11/14/22 = zero scores of ‘3’; 12/12/22 = 55 scores of ‘3’), however, overall, there were no statistical differences in pregnancy status across ewes (P = 0.78). All SNAP test results were immediate and positive for pregnancy for all collections apart from one ewe, 9113, with a conception date of 10/19/22. Ewe 9113 SNAP test result for the first collection was “not pregnant”, and for the second collection date, a positive result did not appear until 5 min and 43 sec. Lambing revealed that 9113 had a singleton female lamb. Based on the present study, sex and number of lamb offspring could not be determined by commercial blood pregnancy tests. In the present study, the earliest confirmed pregnancy determined retrospectively by subtracting average ewe gestation length (152 d) from the lambing date was determined to be September 28th but blood sampling and testing for PAGs did not begin until November 14th, therefore, further studies are needed that initiate blood sampling sooner.","https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/102/Supplement_1/104/56821499/skae019.117.pdf",""

However, the cell-specific and temporal expression of enzymes for the synthesis and metabolism of fructose in sheep conceptuses (embryo and placental membranes) and placentomes has not been characterized. This study characterized key enzymes involved in fructose synthesis and metabolism by ovine conceptuses throughout pregnancy. Day 17 conceptuses expressed mRNAs for the polyol pathway (SORD and AKR1B1) and glucose and fructose metabolism (HK1, HK2, G6PD, OGT, and FBP), but not those required for gluconeogenesis (G6Pase or PCK). Ovine placentomes also expressed mRNAs for SORD, AKR1B1, HK1, and OGT. Fructose can be metabolized via the ketohexokinase (KHK) pathway, and isoforms, KHK-A and KHK-C, were expressed in ovine conceptuses from Day 16 of pregnancy and placentomes during pregnancy in a cell-specific manner. The KHK-A protein was more abundant in the trophectoderm and cotyledons of placentomes, while KHK-C protein was more abundant in the endoderm of Day 16 conceptuses and the chorionic epithelium in placentomes. Expression of KHK mRNAs in placentomes was greatest at Day 30 of pregnancy (P &lt; 0.05), but not different among days later in gestation. These results provide novel insights into the synthesis and metabolism of fructose via the uninhibited KHK pathway in ovine conceptuses to generate ATP via the tricarboxylic cycle, as well as substrates for the pentose cycle, hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, and one-carbon metabolism required for conceptus development throughout pregnancy.","https://academic.oup.com/biolreprod/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/biolre/ioae043/57132344/ioae043.pdf",""

However, current photonic tensor core (PTC) designs based on standard optical components hinder scalability and compute density due to their large spatial footprint. To address this, we propose an ultracompact PTC using customized programmable multi-operand multimode interference (MOMMI) devices, named M3ICRO. The programmable MOMMI leverages the intrinsic light propagation principle, providing a single-device programmable matrix unit beyond the conventional computing paradigm of one multiply-accumulate operation per device. To overcome the optimization difficulty of customized devices that often requires time-consuming simulation, we apply ML for optics to predict the device behavior and enable differentiable optimization flow. We thoroughly investigate the reconfigurability and matrix expressivity of our customized PTC and introduce a novel block unfolding method to fully exploit the computing capabilities of a complex-valued PTC for near-universal real-valued linear transformations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that M3ICRO achieves a 3.5–8.9× smaller footprint, 1.6–4.4× higher speed, 9.9–38.5× higher compute density, 3.7–12× higher system throughput, and superior noise robustness compared to state-of-the-art coherent PTC designs.

To test this hypothesis, we used data collected from the 2023 Masculinity, Sexual Health, and Politics ( MSHAP) survey, a national probability sample of 1,840 men, and regression analyses to model personal gun ownership as a function of penis size dissatisfaction, experiences with penis enlargement, social desirability, masculinity, body mass, mental health, and a range of sociodemographic characteristics. We find that men who are more dissatisfied with the size of their penises are less likely to personally own guns across outcomes, including any gun ownership, military-style rifle ownership, and total number of guns owned. The inverse association between penis size dissatisfaction and gun ownership is linear; however, the association is weakest among men ages 60 and older. With these findings in mind, we failed to observe any differences in personal gun ownership between men who have and have not attempted penis enlargement. To our knowledge, this is the first study to formally examine the association between penis size and personal gun ownership in America.

To further understand the adaptive significance of synchrony in reproductive events, we examined two hypotheses to link over-winter body mass with lower synchrony of conceptions in a wild population of white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus (Zimmermann, 1780)) in central Texas. If females maintain over-winter body mass, then the window of time that conception occurs should be relaxed and longer relative to females where over-winter body mass declines. Across 9 years, we measured body mass in 1.5-year-old and older females in November ( n = 170) and in March (118). In March, we also measured forehead–rump lengths in offspring of gravid females and calculated conception dates. Over-winter body mass did not decline but was maintained, on average, across the years of study. Conception dates ranged over 50 days and 52% of conceptions occurred in a 2-week period centered on the median conception date. Relative to northern populations of deer, there was lower synchrony in conception dates.

The folate transport mechanism in the human placenta was utilized as a possible pathway for the transplacental delivery of targeted nanoparticles. Methods:: Several types of folic acid-decorated polymeric nanoparticles were synthesized and characterized. During transport studies of targeted and non-targeted fluorescent nanoparticles across the placental barrier, the apparent permeability values, uptake, transfer indices, and distribution in placental tissue were determined. Results:: The nanoparticles had no effect on BeWo b30 cell viability. In vitro, studies showed significantly higher apparent permeability of the targeted nanoparticles across the cell monolayers as compared to the nontargeted nanoparticles (Pe = 5.92 ± 1.44 ×10-6 cm/s for PLGA-PEG-FA vs. 1.26 ± 0.31 ×10-6 cm/s for PLGA-PEG, P < 0.05), and the transport of the targeted nanoparticles was significantly inhibited by excess folate. Ex vivo placental perfusion showed significantly greater accumulation of the targeted nanoparticles in the placental tissue (4.31 ± 0.91%/g for PLGA-PEG-FA vs. 2.07 ± 0.26%/g for PLGA-PEG).

Variable‐speed technology is a new and critical direction for the development of PSPs. In pump mode, variable‐speed pumped storage units (VSPSUs) have wider power regulation ranges and more flexible power responses than fixed‐speed pumped storage units (FSPSUs); however, the corresponding quantification study of VSPSUs is rare. Therefore, this study aims to quantify the static and dynamic power regulation characteristics of VSPSU in pump mode. First, the modeling of the fast speed control strategy of VSPSU in pump mode is improved. Then, the power regulation range of the VSPSU is explored. The factors (i.e., power command, governor, and converter) affecting the power response rapidity are quantified through the engineering case of a variable‐speed PSP adopting the doubly fed induction machine. Accordingly, suggestions on the settings of the parameters are provided. Quantification results show that parameter tuning based on this study effectively solves the problem of low regulation rate caused by great power fluctuations under typical power regulation cases in pump mode. This VSPSU has the fastest regulation rate of 13.75%/s when adjusting 40% power. This study could provide technical support to the practical operation of VSPSU.","",""

While caffeine is a potent countermeasure to improve alertness and performance, it can also interfere with sleep. This can lead to performance deficits on the following day, driving a cycle of caffeine use to counter the effects of caffeine-induced sleep disruption. Caffeine availability may be limited during future Artemis and/or Mars missions. Therefore, we aimed to characterize how caffeine is used aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to better inform future spaceflight operations. Methods: Daily caffeine consumption was determined from food and beverage intake tracking for 25 astronauts (11F) on 6-month International Space Station (ISS) missions. Data were recorded using the ISS Food Intake Tracker iPad App or other detailed recording technique. On average, crew recorded dietary intake on 179.7±68.6 (mean±SD) days inflight. Results: Astronauts consumed 97±92 mg caffeine per day. All astronauts (25/25) in this study consumed caffeine at some point during flight, though the frequency, amounts, and regularity differed across crewmembers. Approximately a quarter of crewmembers were regular caffeine consumers (6/25), i.e., they ingested at least 90 mg caffeine (equivalent to one cup of coffee) on 90% of inflight days. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that caffeine is regularly consumed by astronauts, though consumption patterns vary across individuals. Future analyses will involve evaluating these data in light of sleep and performance outcomes. This information will provide us with an understanding of how caffeine is being used inflight to help guide future countermeasure development.

None of the arguments succeeds. The first two rest on assumptions that the A-theorist has reasons to reject, in light of facts about the nature of conscious experience – facts concerning both its basis in physical and functional processes, and facts concerning its representation of duration.

Sensitivity to climate change can be systematically evaluated for multiple species using geographic attributes such as range size and climate niche breadth, and using species traits associated with climate change sensitivity. These systematic evaluations produce relative rankings of species sensitivity to aid conservation prioritization and to identify relatively sensitive species that may otherwise be understudied or overlooked. Due in part to biogeographic constraints, species assemblages change across regions and spatial extents; yet, the degree to which spatial factors influence relative rankings of species sensitivity is unclear. The spatial extent of multispecies analyses may alter relative rankings of species climate sensitivity; alternatively, relative climate sensitivity may be conserved among spatial scales, resulting in consistent identification of sensitive species among regions and spatial extents. We investigated how spatial extent influences our understanding of relative climate sensitivity for 137 native freshwater fishes of the United States that were representative of taxonomic, trait, and geographic diversity. Using publicly available occurrence data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, we calculated a systematic, geographically derived index of climate change sensitivity for study species at national and regional extents, including within four major hydrologic subregions of the United States. We examined the effects of spatial extent on the relative ranking of climate sensitivity among species, and we explored relationships among climate sensitivity, species traits, and conservation status at regional and national extents. We found that climate sensitivity rankings of species were influenced by spatial extent in some specific instances, but that relative rankings were largely conserved across spatial scales. However, correlations among geographically derived climate sensitivity rankings and species traits associated with climate sensitivity were variable across scales and regions, suggesting that links between geographic rarity and species traits may be scale‐dependent in some cases. Finally, we found few associations between climate sensitivity and current conservation status among species. Systematic approaches to quantifying climate sensitivity may offer an opportunity to identify sensitive but overlooked species for pre‐listing actions such as monitoring or conservation agreements.","https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ecs2.4779",""

For numerical implementation of thermo‐sensitive hydrogel, many approaches have been developed to simulate the transient deformation during fluid diffusion or heat conduction process. However, the numerical approach for the transient deformation during both fluid diffusion and heat conduction processes is still lacking. To this end, we develop a three‐field coupled finite element framework that can be used to simulate the transient deformation behavior of thermo‐sensitive hydrogel involving large deformation, fluid diffusion, and heat conduction. In the proposed framework, there exist three processes that deal with displacement, concentration, and temperature fields, separately. To realize the coupling of three fields, the separated solving processes are assembled together by using a two‐way coupled approach. Based on the developed finite element framework, the coupling effects between the concentration and temperature can be realized by defining a body flux and a temperature‐dependent diffusion coefficient without solving the complex coupling equations. The finite element framework is implemented in ABAQUS by utilizing several user subroutines. The numerical implementation is validated by comparing the numerical results of a hydrogel disk with experimental results. Furthermore, various numerical examples are simulated to investigate the applicability of the proposed finite element framework under different multi‐field coupling conditions. The proposed finite element scheme is proved to be an efficient and stable tool for numerically simulating the transient behavior of thermo‐sensitive hydrogel incorporating the phase transition effect.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/nme.7550",""

Here, integrative structural biology and biochemistry studies on non-structural protein 1 of influenza B virus (NS1B) reveal a previously unrecognized viral mechanism for innate immune evasion. Conserved basic groups of its C-terminal domain (NS1B-CTD) bind 5’-triphosphorylated double-stranded RNA (5’ppp-dsRNA), the primary pathogen-associated feature that activates the host retinoic acid-inducible gene I protein (RIG-I) to initiate interferon synthesis and the cellular antiviral response. Like RIG-I, NS1B-CTD preferentially binds blunt-end 5’ppp-dsRNA. NS1B-CTD also competes with RIG-I for binding 5’ppp-dsRNA, and thus suppresses activation of RIG-I’s ATPase activity. Although the NS1B N-terminal domain also binds dsRNA, it utilizes a different binding mode and lacks 5’ppp-dsRNA end preferences. In cells infected with wild-type influenza B virus, RIG-I activation is inhibited. In contrast, RIG-I activation and the resulting phosphorylation of transcription factor IRF-3 are not inhibited in cells infected with a mutant virus encoding NS1B with a R208A substitution it its CTD that eliminates its 5’ppp-dsRNA binding activity. These results reveal a novel mechanism in which NS1B binds 5’ppp-dsRNA to inhibit the RIG-I antiviral response during influenza B virus infection, and open the door to new avenues for antiviral drug discovery.","https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3874434/v1",""

No vaccines or approved therapies are available to prevent or treat HRTV disease. Here, we describe the genetic changes, natural history of disease, and pathogenesis of a mouse-adapted HRTV (MA-HRTV) that is uniformly lethal in 7- to 8-week-old AG129 mice at low challenge doses. We used this model to assess the efficacy of the ribonucleoside analog, 4′-fluorouridine (EIDD-2749), and showed that once-daily oral treatment with 3 mg/kg of drug, initiated after the onset of disease, protects mice against lethal MA-HRTV challenge and reduces viral loads in blood and tissues. Our findings provide insights into HRTV virulence and pathogenesis and support further development of EIDD-2749 as a therapeutic intervention for HRTV disease. IMPORTANCE: More than 60 cases of HRTV disease spanning 14 states have been reported to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The expanding range of the Lone Star tick that transmits HRTV, the growing population of at-risk persons living in geographic areas where the tick is abundant, and the lack of antiviral treatments or vaccines raise significant public health concerns. Here, we report the development of a new small-animal model of lethal HRTV disease to gain insight into HRTV pathogenesis and the application of this model for the preclinical development of a promising new antiviral drug candidate, EIDD-2749. Our findings shed light on how the virus causes disease and support the continued development of EIDD-2749 as a therapeutic for severe cases of HRTV infection.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/jvi.00132-24",""

Previous studies report conflicting results regarding the effects of ultraviolet (UV) light in reducing infections. This trial evaluated the impact of adding pulsed-xenon UV (PX-UV) to standard terminal cleaning in reducing environmentally implicated HAIs (eiHAIs). Methods: The Lowering the Acquisition of MDROs with Pulsed-xenon (LAMP) trial was conducted in 2 hospitals (15 inpatient wards) utilizing a cluster-randomized, controlled, double-blinded, interventional crossover trial comparing standard terminal cleaning followed by either PX-UV (intervention arm) or sham (control arm) disinfection. The primary outcome was incidence of eiHAIs from clinical microbiology tests on the fourth day of stay or later or within 3 days after discharge from the study unit. EiHAIs included clinical cultures positive for vancomycin-resistant enterococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase–producing Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumonia, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Acinetobacter baumannii, and stool polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive for Clostridiodes difficile. Results: Between 18 May 2017 and 7 January 2020, 25 732 patients were included, with an incidence of 601 eiHAIs and 180 954 patient-days.

Study results were similar when stratified by eiHAI type, hospital, and unit type. Conclusions: The LAMP study failed to demonstrate an effect of the addition of UV light disinfection following terminal cleaning on reductions in rates of eiHAIs.

Despite the abundant knowledge on PI, we know very little on why and how PI sustains over time. This is particularly true in the context of heterogeneous frontline teams of physicians and nurses with different operational characteristics such as attrition rates, skill sets, training, and goals. Our study builds a model that simulates the mutual, dynamic interaction of these stakeholders with each other and with processes with different characteristics in the presence of endogenous management prioritization. We build confidence in the model by calibrating it to data from PI teams at several family medicine clinics at a large US Midwestern healthcare system. The computational experiments performed using data from these teams yield several important insights for theory and practice. First, we find that process metrics, which are leading metrics related to the day-to-day functioning of the units, and outcome metrics, which are lagging metrics often tied to the unit's bottom line, are both critical for the functioning of the PI teams. Emphasizing one over the other can reduce sustainability while a mixed case in which one group of employees is incentivized to leading and another group to lagging can create a regime that is more effective in many scenarios. Second, we find that management interventions that improve short-term PI gains generally also reduce the likelihood of long-run sustainment. Third, we find that attrition and turnover among the team members affect sustainability of PI initiatives and reducing turnover for one class of employee, which attends lagging metrics, facilitates sustainment while reducing it for the other class, which attends leading metrics, can hinder sustainment. We conclude by discussing these implications to the practice of PI among healthcare teams.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/10591478231224937",""

By employing two large datasets of U.S. congressional hearings to analyze policymakers' behavior of sending political messages, which we call “grandstanding,” we offer two findings. First, consistent with our hypotheses, grandstanding is more prevalent when committees are focused on new and emerging problems than when committees examine proposed alternatives or the implementation of existing policies. Second, the cognitive dynamics of problem solving and the incentives to grandstand vary depending on policy issues considered in hearings. Our analysis helps put dissatisfaction with contemporary U.S. policymaking in context: a rise in “messaging politics” derives at least in part from an increased focus on contesting the problem space in agenda‐setting venues.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/psj.12526",""

However, little is known about the relationship between these different digging patterns and the anatomy and evolution of the atlantoaxial complex. In this study, we used computed microtomography data to describe in detail of the atlantoaxial complex for 15 species, belonging to all six current families of Amphisbaenia. Furthermore, we evaluate evolutionary scenarios of selected characters related to the atlantoaxial complex in the most recent phylogeny for Amphisbaenia, using the criteria of parsimony and maximum likelihood. Our results indicate that the evolutionary pattern of the atlantoaxial complex presents a diversification in its morphology that is not always correlated with the shape of the head. This analysis reinforces the hypothesis of remarkable morphological convergences in the evolutionary history of Amphisbaenia.

Reduced access to treatment is partially due to limited training opportunities. Web-based training resources are valuable because they are easily accessible, are cost-efficient, and can be reviewed by providers as needed. This presentation describes the development, testing, and launch of a web-based provider training for CBT-N. Methods: Nightmare, trauma, and sleep disorder experts collaborated to develop material for the web-based CBT-N training. Next, 17 providers tested a first draft of the web-site. After feedback was integrated, 50 providers were recruited to complete the updated draft of the website and will complete feedback in January 2024. To assess learning, providers completed multiple-choice questions before and after each of the 10 training modules. Item Response Theory (IRT) analyses were used to identify items of low discrimination and difficulty for further refinement. Results: Overall, testers had positive reactions to the training content and website. The training content was improved by adding more figures, animations, and therapy demonstration videos and integrating more cultural considerations. Usability was improved by addressing bugs and enhancing intuitive site navigation. Based on IRT analyses of multiple-choice questions, 40 (out of a total 80) items were replaced and will be re-evaluated at the conclusion of beta testing. Conclusion: Launching in June 2024, CBTnightmares.org is a comprehensive, engaging, and accessible training after two phases of development and feedback from almost 70 licensed providers. The final phase of testing, to be conducted in April 2024, will examine the equivalence of online training compared to a live virtual workshop (Target N = 100). Providers will complete questionnaires and a mock session with a standardized patient to examine therapist proficiency and fidelity. The hypotheses are that this web-based course will be equivalent to a live virtual workshop.

A more recently available brand of zinc‐based mouth rinses advertises one of its mouth rinses as a substitute for chlorhexidine. The purpose of this study was to evaluate, in vitro, the effects of this brand of zinc‐based mouth rinses on cell survival, cell motility, and gene expression of human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs). Methods: HGFs were exposed to essential oil (EO), CHX, and three types of one brand of zinc‐based mouth rinses designed to treat breath malodor (ZnA), dry mouth (ZnB), and gingivitis (ZnC). Each mouth rinse was tested over a range of concentrations for its effects on HGF survival and motility. Gene expression of cytokines, interleukins, and growth factors were evaluated via reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR), as a means to assess potential influences on inflammation and wound healing. Results: Cell survival was significantly decreased for CHX and ZnC at 10% dilutions ( Conclusion: ZnC was more cytotoxic and inhibited cell motility to a greater extent than any of the other mouth rinses. Therefore, using ZnC as an alternative to CHX could potentially have negative effects on wound healing after periodontal surgery. However, further investigation is required to confirm the clinical relevance of these in vitro findings. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: One type of zinc‐based mouth rinse designed to replace chlorhexidine (often prescribed after oral surgeries) demonstrated the greatest oral cell death and reduction in cell movement when compared to other zinc‐based mouth rinses. These zinc‐based mouth rinses also reduced the amounts of proteins involved in regulating inflammation, potentially reducing the destruction of bone holding the teeth in place. They also changed the amounts of several molecules involved in tissue healing. It is unknown if this will speed or slow the healing of the soft tissues of the mouth.","",""

The repeated attempt processing issue detection (RAPID) method is a novel method developed as a combination of response process and answer-until-correct validity. Results from this new method revealed validity issues that were undetected from the use of either approach individually or in concert.","http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2024/RP/D3RP00204G",""

To answer these questions, we analyzed provider directory accuracy and timely access for physical therapists for all managed care plans available in California in 2018 and 2019 using secondary data obtained from the California Department of Managed Health Care for a total of 119,084 physical therapy listings (60,967 for 2018 and 58,117 for 2019). Overall, 19% of listed providers in 2018 and 8% of listed providers in 2019 showed inaccuracies. However, we found substantial differences across markets, with a low of 54% accuracy for Medicaid listings in 2018. Commercial plans were consistently most accurate. In terms of adequacy, we found that more than 90% of listed providers were accessible within 15 days and 97% within 30 days, with Medicaid providing the highest rates of timely access. Overall, barriers to consumer access with regard to physical therapy appear to be primarily in the form of provider directory inaccuracies. High rates of inaccuracies raise concerns for patients as well as regulators.

Background: Contemporary standards for good parenting are increasingly resource‐based. Method: This study draws on 44 in‐depth interviews with low‐income Black mothers and grandmothers to examine their survival strategies, focusing on food provision. Results: Findings reveal that these mothers prioritize basic needs provision, such as food and feeding, and achieve this often difficult goal by engaging a cultural toolkit that we term symbiotic mothering. Symbiotic mothering is constructed and reinforced through the collective processes of maternal exchange, mutual aid and resource pooling, and the intergenerational and horizontal transmission of cultural knowledges, values, and practices. Conclusions: While there is a wealth of scholarship interrogating the ways Black women deviate from dominant mothering expectations, symbiotic mothering highlights the unique cultural skillsets these mothers actively engage to meet the everyday demands of mothering, particularly related to food provision.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jomf.12976",""

We empirically document that firms with ERM programs have lower cash effective tax rates than firms without ERM. Additionally, we find that the relation between ERM and tax avoidance is stronger among firms with more business segments. Finally, our results suggest ERM adoption offsets an increase in opacity and tax uncertainty typically associated with tax avoidance strategies.

This article explores how people make sense of algorithms, as seen through (dis)belief in algorithmic conspirituality, where users ascribe divine significance to algorithmic curation on TikTok. We ask: how do users understand algorithmic conspirituality, and under what circumstances do they believe (or not) in the mystical power of algorithms? Drawing on focus groups and interviews with TikTok users ( n = 25), we observed what we call reflexive ambivalence. This refers to a reflexive process in which participants examined their cognitive and affective responses to algorithmic conspirituality videos to untangle seemingly contradictory logical and mystical mentalities. With this insight, we complicate past work by demonstrating the co-occurrence and interdependency of rational, technical vs. affective, socially situated ways of knowing algorithms. We additionally highlight conditions under which belief in algorithmic conspirituality gained plausibility for our participants and how they rationalized the phenomenon as grounded in the worldly realm.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/13548565241258949",""

The main purpose of this study was to compare the differences in consumers’ perceptions and willingness to pay as they relate to retail floral providers’ sustainable and environmentally sound practices based on demographic traits. A total of 2172 people responded to an online survey. The sample used in this study was a random selection of individuals 18 years of age or older living in the United States.

Results indicated there was a difference in the way respondents answered the survey questions based on demographics. Respondents 34 years of age or younger with college experience indicated the most willingness to make purchases and pay premiums from floral providers that incorporate sustainable attributes into their business model. Males indicated a stronger willingness to shop at a floral provider based on several of the environmental statements when compared with other genders. The results provide evidence of the value of the integration of sustainability practices into the business model of floral providers to make it more competitive.","https://journals.ashs.org/downloadpdf/journals/horttech/34/1/article-p27.xml",""

However, the extrinsic factors that limit hybridization are poorly understood for most animal systems. Although the spatial ecology of individuals in natural habitats is fundamental to shaping reproductive success and survival, analyses of the spatial ecology of hybrids and their parental groups are rarely reported. Here, we used radiotelemetry to monitor wild rattlesnakes across an interspecific hybrid zone (Crotalus scutulatus and Crotalus viridis) and measured movement parameters and space use (utilization distributions) of individuals to evaluate the hypothesis that hybridization resulted in transgressive or atypical movement patterns. Unexpectedly, of the spatial metrics we investigated, we found that hybrids were very similar to parental individuals. Nonetheless, hybrids did show increased patchiness of core utilization distributions, but this result is likely to be driven by increased habitat patchiness in the hybrid zone. Overall, we did not find evidence for overt extrinsic barriers to hybridization associated with spatial ecology; thus, we suggest that the close evolutionary history between the two parental species and their ecological and behavioural similarities are likely to increase the probability of hybridization events in this unique region of New Mexico.","https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/biolinnean/blae037/57086099/blae037.pdf",""

Yet, how the fundamental structure of the merged supply base changes after the M&A and how the structural changes affect the performance are largely unknown. Building upon the strategy‐structure‐performance framework, this study investigates dual roles of supply base structural changes in M&A events, namely, as an outcome and as a moderator to post‐M&A performance. In particular, we examine how the size and the country diversity of the merged supply base change after M&As, as well as how these structural changes affect the merged firm's operational performance. We conduct a difference‐in‐differences analysis by comparing firms that engaged in M&A events (treatment group) with those comparable firms that did not engage in any M&A events (control group). The results show that the merged firms tend to reduce the size of their supply bases after M&As. In addition, our results demonstrate that both supply base consolidation (i.e., reducing the number of suppliers) and country diversification (i.e., spreading suppliers across multiple countries) improve the merged firms’ post‐M&A operational performance, an effect that becomes stronger for horizontal M&As. We also explore how the type of M&As (i.e., horizontal vs. nonhorizontal), industry relatedness between the two merging firms, and the purposes of M&As affect the post‐M&A structural changes to the supply bases. This study helps inform supply managers the important roles of supply base in M&As to enhance post‐M&A operational performance or to limit the synergies when not properly done.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/deci.12631",""

One of primary methods implemented in filed applications for enhanced oil recovery is surfactant huff-puff. Currently, a large number of surfactant treatments are conducted in laboratories prior to field applications to optimize the design of surfactant huff-puff, test the performance of surfactants, and minimize failure risk. This process is time-consuming since a treatment could last from several days to more than 300 days. Moreover, a fraction of treatments could not improve oil recovery as reported in the literature. In this paper, we provide a machine learning based solution to improve this process. A comprehensive dataset that systematically compiles project data on surfactant treatments in carbonate reservoirs is constructed. Based on this dataset, machine learning models are developed to forecast incremental oil recovery resulting from surfactant treatments. Random forest model presents the best performance. This research could predict surfactant performance before a surfactant treatment is conducted, which could fasten laboratory investigation, save time and cost. Furthermore, an adaptive, offline, and friendly graphical user interface is designed to enable data analysis and assist in decision-making. With desktop application, it is easy to conduct data analytics and could be accessible for most engineers.","https://onepetro.org/SPEWRM/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/218875-MS/3387668/spe-218875-ms.pdf",""

V. unguiculata’s herbage and root production responded negatively to manure BC and 2% of any BC, respectively, which is mainly explained by the conductivity and soil P increase, respectively. When V. unguiculata was grown, BC inclusion decreased NO3-N and increased the soil P content. When C. dactylon was grown, only P was altered (increased) when manure or the blend BC were applied. The soil total C increased as the BC loading rate increased. The application of high BC rates was detrimental for V. unguiculata, but showed a neutral effect for C. dactylon. To improve dairy waste recycling, saturated 1% blend BC and saturated 2% blend or manure BC could be applied to V. unguiculata and C. dactylon, respectively, with no short-term negative impacts.

Participants reported attachment to parental figures (maternal and/or paternal), anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms. Response surface analyses were tested in each country separately.

This article presents a novel architecture that integrates PUF, blockchain, and Tangle for Security-by-Design (SbD) of healthcare cyber–physical systems (H-CPSs). Healthcare systems around the world have undergone massive technological transformation and have seen growing adoption with the advancement of Internet-of-Medical Things (IoMT). The technological transformation of healthcare systems to telemedicine, e-health, connected health, and remote health is being made possible with the sophisticated integration of IoMT with machine learning, big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and other technologies. As healthcare systems are becoming more accessible and advanced, security and privacy have become pivotal for the smooth integration and functioning of various systems in H-CPSs. In this work, we present a novel approach that integrates PUF with IOTA Tangle and blockchain and works by storing the PUF keys of a patient’s Body Area Network (BAN) inside blockchain to access, store, and share globally. Each patient has a network of smart wearables and a gateway to obtain the physiological sensor data securely. To facilitate communication among various stakeholders in healthcare systems, IOTA Tangle’s Masked Authentication Messaging (MAM) communication protocol has been used, which securely enables patients to communicate, share, and store data on Tangle. The MAM channel works in the restricted mode in the proposed architecture, which can be accessed using the patient’s gateway PUF key. Furthermore, the successful verification of PUF enables patients to securely send and share physiological sensor data from various wearable and implantable medical devices embedded with PUF. Finally, healthcare system entities like physicians, hospital admin networks, and remote monitoring systems can securely establish communication with patients using MAM and retrieve the patient’s BAN PUF keys from the blockchain securely. Our experimental analysis shows that the proposed approach successfully integrates three security primitives, PUF, blockchain, and Tangle, providing decentralized access control and security in H-CPS with minimal energy requirements, data storage, and response time.","https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/3/938/pdf",""

Because some fishes are preparing to spawn or are spawning during these seasons, there is a critical need to better understand the potential influences of these surveys on decisions that are related to fish reproduction. Methods: We tested whether spring mark–recapture surveys using fyke nets followed by electrofishing affect the reproductive behaviors of male Smallmouth Bass Result: The mark–recapture surveys were conducted preceding the spawning of Smallmouth Bass, and returning males that were caught in the electrofishing survey nested ~50 m farther from their prior year's nest than both males that were captured only in fyke nets and males that were captured by neither method. Average interyear nest distances were ~200 m, and median interyear nest distances were ~90 m for males that were not captured in the electrofishing survey. Electrofishing and fyke netting did not influence the timing of reproduction. Conclusion: Spring electrofishing surveys for Smallmouth Bass have the potential to displace breeding males from preferred nesting habitats. If displacement negatively influences fitness (i.e., age‐0 survivorship to maturation), spring electrofishing surveys would not be recommended for assessing Smallmouth Bass populations. However, spring population surveys often occur soon after ice off, and surveys that are conducted at these colder temperatures are typically less stressful and less likely to result in mortality. Future research should test for fitness implications of reduced nest site fidelity following electrofishing in Smallmouth Bass while considering potential fitness trade‐offs if surveys are moved later in the year.","https://afspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/nafm.10964",""

In this research, we develop Classification and Regression Tree (CART) models that use daily temperature data for the months of March, April, May, and June to predict the likelihood of a heatwave within the next 7 days, the next 28 days, and on any particular day based on daily high temperatures from the previous 14 days. We also use different model parameters to evaluate the accuracy of the models. Finally, we develop treed Stepwise Logistic Regression models to predict the probability of heatwaves occurring. Even though this research uses data from Bangladesh Meteorological Department, the developed modeling approach can be used in other geographic regions.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/exsy.13656",""

However, mainstream environmental messages ignore youth concerns, blame individuals, and suggest techno-fixes rather than addressing root causes. Young people need a way to productively process and collectively engage with their complex feelings about the climate crisis. During the spring of 2023, a group of university students facilitated a Research-based Theatre project to explore their relationship to climate and environmental justice as part of a biannual performance festival of student new work. Specifically, we used Theatre of the Oppressed techniques to slow down and embody participants’ struggles with environmental action. We argue that this process allowed participants to explore how and why they made sense of mainstream environmental messaging about the climate crisis. This paper offers a case study exploring how the interwoven themes of power, positionality, and agency emerged through embodied investigations during the early development of our Research-based Theatre performance. The paper concludes by discussing how Research-based Theatre can embrace a post-activist lens that supports the complexity of sense-making and troubles the over-emphasis on solution as the only response to environmental/climate crisis. Further, we argue for the kin-making possibilities that crisis can teach us when engaged through embodied exploration.","https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0752/13/4/120/pdf",""

Time-inhomogeneity for the Hawkes process is indispensable for short rate models or for other calibration purposes, while financial applications for the time-homogeneous case already well known. Distributional properties for such a model generate computational tractability for a financial application. In this paper, moments and the Laplace transform of time-inhomogeneous Hawkes processes are obtained from the distributional properties of the underlying processes. As an applications to finance, we investigate the pricing formula for zero-coupon bonds when short-term interest rates are governed by the time-inhomogeneous Hawkes process. Numerical illustrations are also provided. As an illustrative example, we apply the derived moments and Laplace transform of time-inhomogeneous Hawkes processes to the pricing of zero-coupon bonds within a financial context. By considering the short-term interest rate as driven by inhomogeneous Hawkes processes, we develop explicit formulae for valuing zero-coupon bonds. This application is particularly relevant for modeling interest rate dynamics in real-world scenarios, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of pricing dynamics. Through numerical illustrations, we demonstrate the computational tractability of our approach, showcasing its practical utility for financial practitioners and providing insights into the intricate interplay between time-inhomogeneous Hawkes processes and bond pricing in dynamic markets.</p></abstract>","http://www.aimspress.com/article/doi/10.3934/math.2024858?viewType=html",""

However, quantifying SOC stocks and monitoring carbon (C) fluxes in rangelands are challenging due to the considerable spatial and temporal variability tied to rangeland C dynamics, as well as limited data availability. We developed a Rangeland Carbon Tracking and Management (RCTM) system to track long-term changes in SOC and ecosystem C fluxes by leveraging remote sensing inputs and environmental variable datasets with algorithms representing terrestrial C-cycle processes. Bayesian calibration was conducted using quality-controlled C flux datasets obtained from 61 Ameriflux and NEON flux tower sites from Western and Midwestern U.S. rangelands, to parameterize the model according to dominant vegetation classes (perennial and/or annual grass, grass-shrub mixture, and grass-tree mixture). The resulting RCTM system produced higher model accuracy for estimating annual cumulative gross primary productivity (GPP) (R2 > 0.6, RMSE < 390 g C m-2) than net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) (R2 > 0.4, RMSE < 180 g C m-2), and captured the spatial variability of surface SOC stocks with R2 = 0.6 when validated against SOC measurements across 13 NEON sites. Our RCTM simulations indicated slightly enhanced SOC stocks during the past decade, which is mainly driven by an increase in precipitation. Regression analysis identified slope, soil texture, and climate factors as the main controls on model-predicted C sequestration rate. Future efforts to refine the RCTM system will benefit from long-term network-based monitoring of rangeland vegetation biomass, C fluxes, and SOC stocks.","",""

Deductive qualitative research allows researchers to use existing theory to examine meanings, processes, and narratives of interpersonal and intrapersonal phenomena. Deductive qualitative analysis (DQA; Gilgun, 2005, 2019) is one form of deductive qualitative research that is suited to theory application, testing, and refinement. Within DQA, researchers combine deductive and inductive analysis to examine supporting, contradicting, refining, and expanding evidence for the theory or conceptual model being examined, resulting in a theory that better fits the present sample and accounts for increased diversity in the phenomenon being studied. This paper acts as a primer on DQA and presents two worked examples of DQA studies. Our discussion focuses on the five primary components of DQA: selecting a research question and guiding theory, operationalizing theory, collecting a purposive sample, coding and analyzing data, and theorizing. We highlight different ways of operationalizing theory as sensitizing constructs or as working hypotheses and discuss common pitfalls in theory operationalization. We divide the coding and analyzing process into two sections for parsimony: early analysis, focused on familiarity with the data, code generation, and identification of negative cases, and middle analysis, focused on developing a thorough understanding of evidence related to the guiding theory and negative cases that depart from the guiding theory. Theorizing occurs throughout as researchers consider ways in which the theory being examined is supported, refuted, refined, or expanded. We also discuss strengths and limitations of DQA and potential difficulties researchers may experience when utilizing this methodology.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/16094069241244856",""

This study represents a targeted needs assessment as indicated by Step 2 of Kern's curriculum design to determine the specific training gaps to be addressed within the oncologic EM curriculum. Methods: A multi‐institutional cross‐sectional survey of oncologists (surgical and medical) and emergency physicians (attendings and residents) was conducted during 2023 at five institutions. The voluntary survey consisted of general and specialty‐specific questions exploring gaps in oncologic emergency–specific training/education topics. Descriptive statistics reported responses as frequencies and percentages. Results: Of the 833 surveys sent across the five sites, 302 (36.3%) were accessed by link; of these, 271 (89.7%) surveys were completed. There were no differences in the responses between early and later respondents and no differences in the characteristics of respondents between sites. A vast majority of the oncologist and EM groups (91.2% and 83.0%, respectively) reported a belief that emergency physicians would benefit from additional oncologic emergency training. Our survey identified 16 important topics for inclusion in an oncologic EM curriculum, including five topics not present on the 2022 Model of Clinical Practice of Emergency Medicine. Conclusions: Based on this needs assessment, an oncologic EM curriculum should include the topics listed under oncologic emergencies in the 2022 Model of the Clinical Practice of Emergency Medicine along with our respondent‐identified topics of radiation therapy adverse effects, stem cell transplant complications, and the management of cancer‐specific postsurgical complications, pain, and common diseases in patients with cancer.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/aet2.10987",""

The Blacktip Shark Methods: We compared vertebral elemental signatures (barium [Ba], magnesium [Mg], manganese [Mn], strontium [Sr], and zinc [Zn]) for the first year of life with last occupied habitats (vertebral edges) in Blacktip Sharks collected from the western (Texas and Louisiana) and eastern (Alabama and Florida) coastal waters of the northern GoM. Result: We found significant regional differences in Ba, Mg, Mn, and Sr vertebral edge signatures, suggesting ecological separation of Blacktip Sharks. Significant correlation between first‐year and edge signatures suggested a high degree of residency between life stages. Cross‐validated discriminant function analyses yielded highest regional classification accuracies when Florida sharks were grouped separately west of 88°W (90%), demonstrating the unique elemental signatures of eastern versus western GoM Blacktip Sharks under current management delineations. Conclusion: Combined, these findings demonstrate that trace element markers can distinguish regional populations of Blacktip Sharks and provide a complimentary approach in addition to genetics and physical tagging to support current stock management efforts.","https://afspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/mcf2.10290",""

We apply the concept of institutional isomorphism to 104 interviews conducted with staff, managers, board members, and volunteers from 14 human services nonprofits and explain the isomorphic pathways of individuals adopting dominant mission conceptions. Employing qualitative comparative analysis, we analyze the interviews capturing various combinations of individual backgrounds, motivations for joining the organization, and language used to share the mission with others.

This study examined the relationship between parent-child conflict, familism, and suicidal ideation through the interpersonal theory of suicide. Participants were N = 250 psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents aged 12–17 years (Mage = 14.84, 60.8% female; 41.9% Hispanic, 21.5% African American/Black, 26.0% Caucasian).

Not all substance use disorder (SUD) treatment facilities provide treatment in Spanish. This study examined factors associated with SUD treatment facilities having counselors that provide treatment in Spanish. Methods: State‐level estimates of Spanish‐speaking individuals were derived from the American Community Survey 2019. SUD treatment facility characteristics were captured from the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services 2020. We examined a sample of 15,246 facilities which included 12,798 outpatient, 3554 nonhospital residential, and 1106 with both outpatient and residential programs. Binary logistic regression models were used to observe state‐level proportions of Spanish speakers and facility‐level characteristics as factors associated with a facility having counselors that provide treatment in Spanish. Results: Approximately 23.3% of facilities had counselors able to provide treatment in Spanish. Among outpatient or nonhospital residential SUD facilities, those in a state with a larger proportion of Spanish‐speaking individuals, facilities with pay assistance, facilities that accept Medicaid, and facilities that engage in community outreach had higher odds of having counselors that provide treatment in Spanish. Conclusions: Considering that less than a quarter of facilities provide treatment in Spanish, increasing the availability of linguistically appropriate and culturally responsive services for SUD is imperative. Scientific Significance: This national study is the first of its kind to examine associations between estimates of Spanish speakers and treatment facility characteristics associated with counselors that provide treatment in Spanish in outpatient and nonhospital residential SUD treatment.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ajad.13520",""

Methods: Data were drawn from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). 8676 respondents aged 45 and older were included in the study. In this study, we use ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models to estimate the long-term impact on children of physical punishment from their parents. Results: We found that individuals who recalled being hit by their mother in early life reported more depressive symptoms than those who recalled being punished by their father. Difficult family contexts (e.g., comparative poverty, family violence, and parent's poor mental health) had a weak association with higher risk of reporting physical maltreatment and more depressive symptoms among respondents in later life. Conclusion: This article extended the exploration of the long-term impact of child physical maltreatment beyond adolescence and into until later adult life. Effective policies to protect children from maltreatment in the form of physical punishment require further attention to the challenges posed by tradition and culture.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/00914150231218934",""

Here, we created a “virtual Basal Forebrain”, combining data from numerous rats with cortical retrograde tracer injections into a common 3D reference coordinate space and developed a “spatial density correlation” methodology to analyze patterns in BFCS cortical projection targets, revealing that the BFCS is organized into three principal networks: somatosensory-motor, auditory, and visual. Within each network, clusters of cholinergic cells with increasing complexity innervate cortical targets. These networks represent hierarchically organized building blocks that may enable the BFCS to coordinate spatially selective signaling, including parallel modulation of multiple functionally interconnected yet diverse groups of cortical areas.</p>","https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4504727/v1",""

An existing portfolio of building archetypes is used to model the post‐hazard physical flood functionality of different building typologies within the community with the goal of supporting resilience‐informed decision‐making. Specific fragility‐based flood functionality curves were developed for this portfolio to quantify the exceedance probability of a prescribed set of functionality states. While the physical functionality of buildings is significant to the total functionality of a building and community resilience assessment, the functionality of utilities such as power and water along with the accessibility of the household to essential services such as schools and hospitals is crucial to measure their total functionality. Therefore, functionality models for essential infrastructure were developed to assess housing unit‐ and building‐level functionality following flood hazards. This model also accounts for the functionality of the road network following a flood hazard to identify the level of accessibility of households to different services (e.g., schools, hospitals, gas stations, shopping centers, etc.). The main novelty of this paper is the ability to quantify the total functionality of buildings based on a socio‐physical formulation after including the interdependencies between the functionality of the physical systems and the subsequent functionality of the socio‐economic systems, which is key to measuring resilience at the community level. This was evident from the analysis results using a testbed community of Lumberton, NC, showing that the physical functionality is not sufficient to quantify the total post‐hazard functionality of buildings and that the functionality of other subsystems such as utilities and accessibility to essential services are also needed to quantify the total functionality of buildings and the livability of households.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mice.13135",""

Although use of ES/EMA is widespread in psychology and health sciences, uptake of the method among sociologists has been limited. We argue that ES/EMA offers key advantages for the investigation of sociologically relevant phenomena, particularly in light of recent disciplinary emphasis on investigating the everyday mechanisms through which social structures and micro (individual and relational) processes are mutually constitutive. We describe extant and potential research applications illustrating the advantages of ES/EMA regarding enhanced validity, illuminating micro-temporal processes, and the potential for linkage with spatially and temporally referenced data sources.

Hence, they have become very popular in diverse real-world applications. However, GNN training with large real-world graph datasets in edge-computing scenarios is both memory- and compute-intensive. Traditional computing platforms such as CPUs and GPUs do not provide the energy efficiency and low latency required in edge intelligence applications due to their limited memory bandwidth. Resistive random-access memory (ReRAM)-based processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures have been proposed as suitable candidates for accelerating AI applications at the edge, including GNN training. However, ReRAM-based PIM architectures suffer from low reliability due to their limited endurance, and low performance when they are used for GNN training in real-world scenarios with large graphs. In this work, we propose a learning-for-data-pruning framework, which leverages a trained Binary Graph Classifier (BGC) to reduce the size of the input data graph by pruning subgraphs early in the training process to accelerate the GNN training process on ReRAM-based architectures. The proposed light-weight BGC model reduces the amount of redundant information in input graph(s) to speed up the overall training process, improves the reliability of the ReRAM-based PIM accelerator, and reduces the overall training cost. This enables fast, energy-efficient, and reliable GNN training on ReRAM-based architectures. Our experimental results demonstrate that using this learning for data pruning framework, we can accelerate GNN training and improve the reliability of ReRAM-based PIM architectures by up to 1.6 ×, and reduce the overall training cost by 100 × compared to state-of-the-art data pruning techniques.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3656171",""

To fill this study gaps, this study piloted a screening survey in an African country using the two popular tools (Epworth and Stop Bang), translated and validated among a Yoruba-dominated diverse population of the North-Central region of Nigeria Methods: This was a household survey among rural, urban and semi-urban populations in North-Central Nigeria. A total of 2388 eligible permanent adult residents were selected through a 4-level multistage sampling process. Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Stop Bang Questionnaire (SBQ) were adapted, translated into the Yoruba language, and validated (face, content and construct validity). Both Descriptive and inferential analyses were presented to report the prevalence, pattern and factors associated with sleepiness and OSA. The level of significance was set at a p-value of &lt; 0.05 and a 95% confidence interval. Ethical approval was obtained from the Kwara State Ministry of Health Results: More than a quarter of the respondents were 50 and older, with almost equal gender representation and Yoruba tribe preponderance (87.5%). The urban (34.4%), semi-urban (33.5%) and rural (32.1%) locations were equally distributed. Using the ESS, 15.7% had average sleepiness while 29.4% reported abnormal sleepiness. With the SBQ, 24.2% had a moderate risk of OSA while 5.6% had a high risk of OSA. The geographical pattern of OSA showed no significant distribution with ESS. Still, SBQ shows a significant (p&lt; 0.0001) moderate (38.8%) and high risk (3.9%) of OSA among urban population than semi-urban (moderate: 25.8% vs high: 0.9%) and rural population (moderate:18.9% vs high: 0.3%). Female gender, increasing age, occupation type, low-income earning and obesity were significantly associated with average and abnormal sleepiness using ESS. While being a widow, a large household and obesity were significantly associated with OSA using SBQ. Conclusion: Both the ESS and SBQ tools revealed a moderately high prevalence of sleepiness and OSA, with the urban Nigerian population reporting a higher prevalence.

However, it is unknown if these limits or the underlying contributions of different chloroplastic Pi transporters vary throughout the photoperiod or between chloroplasts in different leaf tissues. To address these questions, we applied live Pi imaging to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) wild-type plants and 2 loss-of-function transporter mutants: triose phosphate/phosphate translocator (tpt), phosphate transporter 2;1 (pht2;1), and tpt pht2;1. Our analyses revealed that stromal Pi varies spatially and temporally, and that TPT and PHT2;1 contribute to Pi import with overlapping tissue specificities. Further, the series of progressively diminished steady-state stromal Pi levels in these mutants provided the means to examine the effects of Pi on photosynthetic efficiency without imposing nutritional deprivation. ΦPSII and nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) correlated with stromal Pi levels. However, the proton efflux activity of the ATP synthase (gH+) and the thylakoid proton motive force (pmf) were unaltered under growth conditions, but were suppressed transiently after a dark to light transition with return to wild-type levels within 2 min. These results argue against a simple substrate-level limitation of ATP synthase by depletion of stromal Pi, favoring more integrated regulatory models, which include rapid acclimation of thylakoid ATP synthase activity to reduced Pi levels.","https://academic.oup.com/plphys/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/plphys/kiae241/57707367/kiae241.pdf",""

Changes in climatic conditions lead to increased environmental stress on embankments, which can result in slope failures. Due to wetting–drying cycles, expansive clayey soil often swells and shrinks, and matric suction is a major factor that controls the behavior. Increased temperature accelerates soil evaporation and drying, which can cause desiccation cracks, while precipitation can rapidly reduce soil shear strength. Desiccated slopes on embankments built with such soils can cause surficial slope failures after intense precipitation. This study used slope stability analysis to quantify how climate-change-induced extreme weather affects embankments. Historic extreme climatic events were used as a baseline to estimate future extremes. CMIP6 provided historical and future climatic data for the study area. An embankment was numerically modeled to evaluate the effect on slope stability due to the precipitation change induced by climate change. Coupled hydro-mechanical finite element analyses used a two-dimensional transient unsaturated seepage model and a limit equilibrium slope stability model. The study found that extreme climatic interactions like precipitation and temperature due to climate change may reduce embankment slope safety. The reduction in the stability of the embankment due to increased precipitation resulting from different greenhouse gas emission scenarios was investigated. The use of unsaturated soil strength and variation of permeability with suction, along with the phase transition of these earthen embankments from near-dry to near-saturated, shows how unsaturated soil mechanics and the hydro-mechanical model can identify climate change issues on critical geotechnical infrastructure.","https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3263/14/2/37/pdf",""

However, the cognitive advantage showed different patterns based on gender and the combination of care intensity and family structure. Grandmothers had a lower risk of dementia than noncaregiving grandmothers when providing a light level of noncoresident grandparenting, whereas grandfathers who provided intensive noncoresident grandparenting had a reduced risk of dementia compared to their noncaregiving counterparts. Grandparenting experiences within multigenerational households and skipped-generation households were not associated with dementia risk.

OBJECTIVE: We extended the community literature by testing ADM’s relations to changes in personality and quality of life that may underpin depression. METHOD: In this longitudinal, observational study, community-dwelling adults (N = 601) were assessed twice, 8 months apart on average. Assessments included depressive symptoms, personality, life satisfaction and quality, and prescription medication consumption. RESULTS: Consuming ADM at time 1 predicted relative increases in depressive symptoms (dysphoria), maladaptive traits (negative affect, negative temperament, disinhibition, low conscientiousness), personality dysfunction (non-coping, self-pathology), and decreases in life satisfaction and quality from time 1 to 2, before and after adjustment for age, gender, race, income, education, physical health problems, and use of other psychotropics. In no analysis did ADM use predict better outcomes. CONCLUSION: Among community-dwelling adults, ADM use is a risk factor for psychosocial deterioration in domains including depressive symptoms, personality pathology, and quality of life. Until mechanisms connecting ADM to poor outcomes in community samples are understood, additional caution in use of ADM and consideration of empirically supported non-pharmacologic treatments is prudent.","https://content.iospress.com/download?id=10.3233/JRS-230016",""

The formation is herein subdivided into a series of formal members, and a lectostratotype section is proposed. Lithostratigraphic and biostratigraphic subdivisions are documented and integrated with geochronologic data to provide an age model for the formation. Four terrestrial vertebrate biozones are proposed. There are at least four major depositional intervals represented in the Aguja and intertonguing Pen Formations. An initial progradational deltaic succession is recorded by the La Basa Sandstone and lower part of the Abajo Shale Members of the Aguja Formation. A second phase of deposition resulted in a retrogradational shoreface succession that includes the upper part of the Abajo Shale, overlying Rattlesnake Mountain Sandstone Member, and lower part of the McKinney Springs Tongue of the Pen Formation, up to a skeletal phosphate bed interpreted to represent the maximum flooding surface. The third phase of deposition comprises a progradational deltaic succession that includes the upper part of the McKinney Springs Tongue, Terlingua Creek Sandstone Member of the Aguja Formation, and lower part of the Alto Shale Member of the Aguja Formation. This third succession records eastward migration of the strandline and withdrawal of the Western Interior Seaway from the Big Bend region. The fourth phase of deposition comprises a series of aggradational fluvial channel and floodplain successions that form the upper part of the Alto Shale Member and is coincident with redirection of stream flow to the southeast. This interval is much thicker in the central part of the Big Bend region, thins to the southwest and northeast, and likely records initial subsidence in the Laramide Tornillo Basin. The upper part of this succession was also contemporaneous with a series of basaltic pyroclastic eruptions, the westernmost expression of the Balcones igneous province. A dramatic constriction in the southern entrance to the Western Interior Seaway through the Gulf of Mexico occurred during this final phase in deposition of the Aguja Formation and corresponds to a shift of stream flow southeastward and to an outbreak of local pyroclastic eruptions. Regional uplift associated with this episode of magmatism is likely responsible for closing the southern aperture of the Western Interior Seaway.","https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geosphere/article-pdf/20/3/825/6439287/ges02662.1.pdf",""

The results of text clustering yielded two clusters focusing on (1) improvements to housing and healthcare services access and policies and (2) unmet needs—social support, mental health, finance, food, and sexuality insecurities. Topic modeling demonstrated four topics, which we themed to represent (1) a holistic care approach; (2) insecurities—food, financial, sexuality, and other basic needs; (3) access to housing and treatment/care; and (4) homelessness and HIV-related health outcomes.

Currently, many laboratories find average flow-volume loops by taking equal increments of the tidal volume and averaging the respective increments of flow for each breath. However, it has been proposed that using equal increments of total time to find an average flow-volume loop could more accurately capture the shape of the loop, which could be critical to determining expiratory flow limitation (EFL) when placed within a maximal flow-volume loop. Purpose: To compare the use of time vs. volume bins on producing averaged flow-volume loops and evaluate whether the results could affect the interpretation of EFL. Methods: Time, volume, and flow data of consecutive breaths at rest and during exercise were obtained for four individuals: one younger healthy man, one older healthy woman, one older man with heart failure, and one child with obesity. The data were separated into individual breaths using zero flow points, then total time and tidal volume were calculated for each full breath. For the time bin method as proposed by M. Younes, equal intervals of time were calculated for both the inspiratory and expiratory phases of each breath. Linear interpolation between surrounding data points was performed to obtain volume and flow values at these intervals. Volume data were then normalized to the tidal volume of the breath by taking the value as a percentage of the total tidal volume. From here, the volume and flow data at the corresponding intervals for each breath were averaged to create the final average flow-volume loop. For the volume bin method, equal intervals of volume were determined based on the tidal volume. Linear interpolation was then used to calculate the respective flow values at these intervals. The volume and flow data at the corresponding intervals for each breath were then averaged to generate the average flow-volume loop data. Standard deviation at each averaged point was also calculated for both methods. Results: Minimal difference was visible between the time bin and volume bin methods at 20 intervals. As the number of intervals used increased, the difference became less apparent. At 250 intervals, the volume bin method depicted the average flow-volume loop as effectively as the time bin method. Addition of standard deviations gave a better view of the variability of flow at any volume. Conclusion: Despite the inherent incrementation associated with the use of time bins vs. volume bins the average flow-volume loops looked very similar. However, the addition of the standard deviations of flow and volume at each data point could yield different results for determining EFL. Also, the time bin method may yield more resolution at rapid transition points at the beginning of inspiration and expiration. Overall, the observed similarities between time bin and volume bin methods are likely due to increased computer capabilities and the ability to create more intervals (i.e., 20 vs. 250), making a constant unit of measurement less necessary.","",""

Rheumatic disorders that are common causes of chronic pain such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, osteoarthritis, and chronic low back pain are frequently found to be comorbid with FM. As a result, this can make the diagnosis of FM more challenging. We aim to develop a reliable classification algorithm using unique spectral profiles of portable FT-MIR that can be used as a real-time point-of-care device for the screening of FM. A novel volumetric absorptive microsampling (VAMS) technique ensured sample volume accuracies and minimized the variation introduced due to hematocrit-based bias. Blood samples from 337 subjects with different disorders (179 FM, 158 non-FM) collected with VAMS were analyzed. A semi-permeable membrane filtration approach was used to extract the blood samples, and spectral data were collected using a portable FT-MIR spectrometer. The OPLS-DA algorithm enabled the classification of the spectra into their corresponding classes with 84% accuracy, 83% sensitivity, and 85% specificity. The OPLS-DA regression plot indicated that spectral regions associated with amide bands and amino acids were responsible for discrimination patterns and can be potentially used as spectral biomarkers to differentiate FM and other rheumatic diseases.","https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/29/2/413/pdf",""

DPR may help address water shortages and is approved or is under consideration as a source of drinking water for several water-stressed population centers in the United States, however, there are no studies of health outcomes in populations who receive DPR drinking water. Our objective was to determine whether the introduction of DPR for certain public water systems in Texas was associated with changes in birth defect prevalence. Methods:: We obtained data on maternal characteristics for all live births and birth defects cases regardless of pregnancy outcome in Texas from 2003 to 2017 from the Texas Birth Defects Registry and birth and fetal death records. The ridge augmented synthetic control method was used to model changes in birth defect prevalence (per 10,000 live births) following the adoption of DPR by four Texas counties in mid-2013, with county-level data on maternal age, percent women without a high school diploma, percent who identified as Hispanic/Latina or non-Hispanic/Latina Black, and rural-urban continuum code as covariates. Results:: There were nonstatistically significant increases in prevalence of all birth defects collectively (average treatment effect in the treated = 53.6) and congenital heart disease (average treatment effect in the treated = 287.3) since June 2013. The estimated prevalence of neural tube defects was unchanged. Conclusions:: We estimated nonstatistically significant increases in birth defect prevalence following the implementation of DPR in four West Texas counties. Further research is warranted to inform water policy decisions.","https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/EE9.0000000000000300",""

Hence, we analyzed 10 human cadaver skulls imaged by microcomputed tomography (micro-CT). Image processing and thickness/heat mapping were performed using Avizo and ImageJ softwares. After identifying the orbital buttresses, we reviewed CT scans of patients who had orbital fractures across three years to determine the frequency of fracture of the orbital buttresses. We identified 5 buttresses of the internal orbit: superomedial fronto-ethmoidal strut with the deep orbital buttress, inferomedial strut with the posterior ledge, inferior orbital fissure, sphenoid-frontal superolateral strut, and the sphenoid lip. The average threshold orbital buttress thickness was 1.36 (0.25) mm. A total of 1186 orbits of 593 individuals were analyzed for orbital buttress involvement. Orbital buttresses were spared in 770 (65%) orbits. The inferomedial strut with the posterior ledge was the most commonly fractured buttress in 14.4% of orbits (n=171), followed by the sphenoid strut and lip (66 [5.6%]). To our knowledge, this is the first description of the buttresses of the internal orbit. Orbital reconstruction for fracture repair or oncologic purposes requires the support of orbital buttresses. Understanding the anatomy of orbital buttresses is crucial for successful surgical planning, proper implant positioning, and restoration of function and appearance.","https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/PRS.0000000000011603",""

In this paper, we utilized qualitative content analyses to explore how an early childhood computer science curriculum created opportunities for young Black and Latinx preschoolers to develop computational thinking skills while engaging in culturally responsive computing. Overwhelmingly, we found the curriculum, co‐developed with educators and caregivers, emphasized unplugged tools and coding activities to support computational thinking. These unplugged opportunities positioned children as innovators with technology and technosocial change agents, in developmentally‐appropriate, play‐based ways. Findings demonstrate a need to emphasize the value of unplugged tools and coding activities in order to support computational thinking and align the goals of culturally responsive computing with the unique needs of young children.

However, the dust grains in a plasma generate local potential disturbances due to the collection of charge and the subsequent electrostatic interactions between the dust and charged plasma particles. Dust grains in close proximity to one another exhibit interesting non-reciprocal interactions and self-organize into structures such as one-dimensional filamentary chains, two-dimensional “zigzags,” and three-dimensional helices, among others. The formation of these structures suggests that although the dust grains may be less invasive than traditional plasma probes, the disturbance to the local plasma environment introduced by dust grains is non-trivial. Commonly used analytic forms of the electric potential describing complex plasmas have failed to resolve the near-dust region, and as a result are insufficient to provide insight about the formation of complex dust structures. Here, we use an N-body simulation to compute the electric potential from ion densities near various dust grain configurations. We provide an alternative description to the standard analytic model for the electric potential of dust and ion wakes based on a Gaussian shaped cloud of ions. The electric potential obtained from simulations is used to identify minimum energy configurations for two and three dust grains. It is further demonstrated that the minimum potential region identified for N dust grains and their associated ion wakes does not predict the minimum-energy configuration of N + 1 dust grains.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pop/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/5.0203902/20052283/073701_1_5.0203902.pdf",""

Venetoclax, a BCL2 inhibitor, has single-agent efficacy in patients with RT and is potentially synergistic with chemoimmunotherapy. In this multicenter, retrospective study, we evaluated 62 patients with RT who received venetoclax-based treatment outside of a clinical trial, in combination with a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi; n=28), rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (R-CHOP) (n=13), or intensive chemoimmunotherapy other than R-CHOP (n=21). The best overall and complete response rates were 36%/25%, 54%/46%, and 52%/38%, respectively. The median progression-free and overall survival estimates for the same treatment groups were 4.9/14.3 months, 14.9 months/not reached, and 3.3/9 months, respectively.

No other clinical or baseline characteristics, including prior venetoclax treatment for CLL, showed statistically significant association with outcomes.

This tutorial describes a practice-informed framework that conceptualizes and organizes a continuum of auditory and visual language supports with the aim of informing the practice of the SLP whose training is more inherently focused on spoken language alone, as well as the practice of the teacher of the Deaf/hh (TDHH) who may focus more on visual language supports. Method:: This product resulted from a need within interdisciplinary, graduate programs for SLPs and TDHHs. Both cohorts required preparation to address the needs of diverse language learners who are Deaf/hh. This tutorial includes a brief review of the challenges in developing language proficiency and describes the complexities of effective service delivery. The process of developing a practice-informed framework for language supports is summarized, referencing established practices in auditory-based and visually based methodologies, identifying parallel practices, and summarizing the practices within a multitiered framework called the Framework of Differentiated Practices for Language Support. Recommendations for use of the framework include guidance on the identification of a student's language modality/ies and proficiency to effectively match students' needs and target supports. Conclusions:: An examination of established practices in language supports across auditory and visual modalities reveals clear parallels that can be organized into a tiered framework. The result is a reference for differentiating language for the interdisciplinary school team. The parallel supports also provide evidence of similarities in practice across philosophical boundaries as professionals work collaboratively.","https://pubs.asha.org/doi/pdf/10.1044/2023_LSHSS-22-00088",""

Upon arrival, calf body weight (BW) was recorded again, and both pre- and post-transport BWs were averaged and used as calf weaning initial BW. Calves were ranked by BW, sex, and age in a completely randomized design and assigned to receive 1) multiple administrations of BAS at weaning (day 0), days 14, 28, and before transport and feedlot entry (day 42; BAS; RSEA Group, Quartier Salignan, France; n = 9 pens/treatment), or 2) placebo (diethylene glycol monoethyl ether; CON; n = 9 pens/treatment). Treatments (5 mL) were applied to the nuchal skin area of each animal during the preconditioning period. Calves within treatment groups were ranked again by initial BW, sex, and age, in a manner that pens have similar initial BW, age, and three steers and two heifers and allocated to 1 of the18 drylot pens. On day 42, calves were combined within the treatment group, loaded into two different single double-deck commercial livestock trailers, and transported for 1,000 km (approximately 16 h). Upon arrival (day 43), calves were unloaded at the same feedyard. Blood samples were collected on days 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, 43, 46, 50, 57, 64, and 90. Average daily gain, final BW, and feed efficiency did not differ (P &gt; 0.52) between BAS and CON calves in the preconditioning and receiving phases. A treatment × day interaction was detected (P &lt; 0.001) for plasma haptoglobin concentrations, which was greater (P &lt; 0.01) in CON on days 3 and 7 vs. BAS calves. During the preconditioning phase, serum NEFA concentration was reduced (P &lt; 0.01) in BAS on day 3 compared with CON calves. A treatment × day interaction was detected (P = 0.001) for exit velocity, which was greater (P &lt; 0.001) for CON vs. BAS calves on days 3, 7, 14, and 21 during the preconditioning phase and on day 46 of the receiving phase.

To test these expectations, we leverage an original dataset including all rules proposed by bureaucratic agencies in three U.S. states from 2004 to 2013 matched with data tracking periods of divided government and legislative recess. We find that state bureaucracies publish significantly more proposed rules during periods of divided government or a split legislature and are most productive in the months immediately following legislative recess.

Study Design: A cross‐sectional design was employed to review RCTs related to rhinoplasty published between January 1, 2005, and January 28, 2022. Setting: The study analyzed clinical trials on rhinoplasty retrieved from PubMed. Methods: We performed a comprehension search on PubMed, blind and duplicate screening, and data extraction. Adherence to the 18 recommendations of the CONSORT Extension for Harms was evaluated, with 1 point assigned for each adhered item. Percent adherence was calculated based on the 18 points, taking into account the multiple subcategories within some recommendations. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize adherence—including frequencies, percentages, and 95% confidence intervals. Results: Our search returned 240 articles, of which 56 met inclusion criteria. No RCTs adhered to all 18 CONSORT Extension for Harms items. Twenty‐six (26/56, 46.4%) adhered to ≥50% of the items, and 30 (30/56, 53.6%) adhered to ≥33.3% of the items. Seven (7/56, 12.5%) RCTs adhered to no items. Across all RCTs, the average number of CONSORT‐Harms items adhered to was 7.2 (7.2/18, 40.0%). The most adhered to item was item 10. Discussion balanced with regard to efficacy and AEs (80.4%, [70.0‐90.8]). Conclusion: This study highlights the inadequacy of AE reporting in rhinoplasty RCTs according to CONSORT‐Harms guidelines.

Findings demonstrate cyberbullying and cyberstalking victimization increase engagement in offending behavior while participants’ fear of sanction reduces engagement in both cyberbullying and cyberstalking perpetration. Notably, results demonstrate that TRDM has a direct, mediating, and moderating effect on both forms of offending. TRDM also has an indirect effect on cyberbullying and cyberstalking perpetration through victimization and participants’ perceptions of sanction. Unlike contemporary, pre-dispositional theories of crime, TRDM is dynamic and can be improved via educational programming.

Later, a multiscale modeling framework utilizing a novel rate-dependent nonlinear viscoelastic cohesive zone (NVCZ) model was used to explore the fracture behavior at the microstructure of the bone and its influence on the global scale (organ-level) response. Toward this end, nanoindentation testing was conducted within the cross-section of a rat femur bone specimen.

Model results using different numbers of spring-dashpot units in the generalized Maxwell model showed that four spring-dashpot units are sufficient to capture the LVE behavior, while solely LVE constitutive relation is limited to fully characterize the rat femur. The LVE constitutive properties were then used along with the rate-dependent NVCZ fracture within the representative volume element (RVE), which was two-way coupled to the global scale bone. A parametric study was conducted by varying the fracture properties of the NVCZ model. The model demonstrated the capability and features to represent inelastic deformation and nonlinear fracture that are linked between length scales. This further implies that the inelastic fracture model and the two-way coupled modeling can elucidate the complex multiscale deformation and fracture of bone, while model validation and further advancements with test results remain a follow-up study and are currently in progress.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/10567895241245716",""

Despite the prevalence and significance of fake reviews, prior research has yet to fully explore the motivations and psychological mechanisms behind voluntary participation in writing fake reviews, especially in incentivized campaigns. This paper explains why consumers engage in the immoral act of writing fake reviews in return for free products. We investigate the interactive role of individuals' self‐focused motivations and cognitive reappraisal ability in diminishing consumers' moral emotions of guilt, subsequently influencing their intention to write incentivized reviews. Built on three studies, the findings reveal that customers' self‐focused motivations coupled with their ability to regulate emotions dissuade their feelings of guilt. Consequently, customers who experience downregulated emotions of guilt show a higher intention to write incentivized fake reviews. This study contributes to the existing literature by illustrating the driving factors toward writing incentivized fake reviews, especially by depicting the negative role of cognitive reappraisal. The study also has managerial implications indicating that such customer behavior can be avoided by fostering a sense of consideration toward others by making them aware about the impact of their actions.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/cb.2315",""

We compared the effect of wood- and manure-derived feedstock BC as well as dairy manure amendment application on Cynodon dactylon performance and soil properties in sandy loam and clay loam soils in a greenhouse pot study. Plant samples were assayed for herbage and root dry weight as well as herbage and root N and C percent and yield. Soil samples were assayed for macronutrients, micronutrients, metals, pH and conductivity. Data analyses involved variance analysis and Tukey’s tests using R in RStudio (the IDE). In general, C. dactylon yields or mineral content were not affected by either manure or BC. However, an increase in the total herbage dry weight (30%) and in herbage N% (55%) was observed for clay loam and sandy loam soil, respectively, due to manure amendment application. There were no alterations in clay loam NO3-N and P due to any treatment; however, in sandy loam, these nutrients were not altered only when wood BC was applied. In sandy loam soil, NO3-N and P increased when manure BC along with dairy manure and when manure BC alone were applied, respectively. Thus, wood BC application should be considered to avoid these nutrient buildups when dairy manure is used as a soil amendment. This research shows a neutral (BC) or positive (dairy manure amendment) impact on C. dactylon performance. BC incorporation increases soil total C, showing potential for C sequestration. Long-term field trials could corroborate plant performance and soil parameters.","https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/13/2/242/pdf",""

Since then, student loan debt and the accumulation patterns based on race have become a pressing issue to address in U.S. society. Purpose:: Student debt is one of the key issues on the federal higher education policy agenda. The purpose of this paper is to examine how race is addressed in a congressional hearing held to discuss the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. Specifically, we examined one congressional policy markup hearing to understand how members frame student debt and the racialized dynamics embedded within. Research Design:: We combined critical race theory and racial frames to discursively analyze 14 hours of congressional hearings on the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. Through critical discourse analysis, we interrogated the racialized discourse among policymakers as they proposed solutions and alternatives to address the issue of student debt during the policy markup process. Conclusions/Recommendations:: Our findings highlight four types of discourse within a policy markup hearing: “All Students” Matter, Paternalistic, Race-Evasive, and Explicit Racial Discourse. We offer recommendations for policymakers and researchers to contend with ahistoricism and race-evasiveness prevalent in policy markup hearings and ways for future policy proposals to be more explicit in naming the groups facing disproportionate negative impact, the mechanisms that produce such inequities, and interventions that can address them.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/01614681241247915",""

Adolescence is a prime time to promote intergroup prosociality due to identity salience during this developmental stage. In this study, our goal was to develop and provide initial validation, of a novel measure on intergroup prosocial behavior considering gender and race/ethnicity. Method: We used two independent samples of early adolescents ( Results: Using the data from Sample 1, Exploratory Factor Analyses revealed a two‐factor solution capturing intergroup prosociality and personal distress. Confirmatory Factor Analyses with data from Sample 2 confirmed the factor structure. The reliability of intergroup prosociality was acceptable. Prosociality subscale was positively correlated with adolescents' empathy, sympathy, compliant, emotional, dire, and anonymous prosocial behaviors indicating convergent validity and negatively correlated with adolescents' public prosocial behavior indicating discriminant validity. Further, we examined whether youth engage in differential intergroup prosocial behavior using both variable‐centered and person‐centered approaches, combining data from Samples 1 and 2. While adolescents did not engage in differential intergroup prosocial behavior, Latent Profile Analyses revealed five distinct profiles of early adolescents' intergroup prosociality. Overall, this study advances research on youth's intergroup prosociality across two intersectional social identities, moving beyond the conceptualization of single social identities in intergroup research.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jad.12305",""

We use satellite observations of stratospheric aerosols, trace gases and temperatures to compute the tropopause radiative flux changes relative to climatology. Overall, the net downward radiative flux decreased compared to climatology. Although the Hunga stratospheric water vapor anomaly increases the downward infrared radiative flux, the solar flux reduction due to Hunga aerosol shroud dominates the net flux over most of the two-year period. Decreases in temperature produced by the Hunga stratospheric circulation changes contributes to the decrease in downward flux; however, the Hunga induced decrease in ozone increases the net short-wave downward flux creating small sub-tropical net flux increase in late 2022. Coincident with the aerosols settling out, the water vapor anomaly disperses, and circulation changes disappear so that the contrasting forcings all decrease together. By the end of 2023, most of the Hunga induced radiative forcing changes have disappeared. There is some disagreement in the satellite stratospheric aerosol optical depth (SAOD) which we view as a measure of the uncertainty; however, SAOD uncertainty does not alter our conclusion that, overall, aerosols dominate the radiative flux changes followed by temperature and ozone.","",""

Experimental measurements of density were complemented by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of these nanofluid samples. The analytical model predicts the effective density of the nanofluid as a function of the mass fractions and densities of the nanoparticle, the base solvent, and the “compressed phase” of the solvent encapsulating the nanoparticle. In this study, casein is used as the nanoparticle candidate at a mass fraction of 1% and paraffin oil (which is essentially a phase change material (PCM)) is used as the neat solvent (base fluid). The experimental measurements demonstrate anomalous enhancement of the density of the oleo-nanofluids, which is 7% in excess of the value predicted by the conventional mixing rule (with a measurement uncertainty less than 1.2%). The formation of a compressed phase within the nanofluid domain is responsible for the “surplus” density (deviant density) of the oleo-nanofluid. The predicted values are found to closely match the actual dimensions of the nanostructures measured in the TEM images, hence conclusively validating the numerical model for estimating the magnitude of the deviant density contributed by the compressed phase. This also confirms the presence of a compressed phase (which is a consequence of the “nanoFin effect”), that was investigated and validated in this study. This surplus densification in hydrocarbons (such as PCM and oil-based nanofluids) makes them potentially attractive candidates as radiation shielding materials (e.g., for deep space exploration applications).","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/openengineering/article-pdf/doi/10.1115/1.4065511/7345061/aoje_3_031014.pdf",""
