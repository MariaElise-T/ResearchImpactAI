The hysteresis curves were measured with a Kerr magnetometer that monitored the longitudinal Kerr ellipticity as a function of the in-plane magnetic field. The strain was created by bending the samples in two dimensions using a pressure cell. Measurements were performed on films with different thicknesses. The magnetoelastic properties appeared to be much smaller for films with a thickness of 100 nm than for films with a thickness of 288 or 500 nm. This might be due to a change of the domain wall pinning, or a change of the domain wall density as a function of the film thickness. Measurements under compressive isotropic in-plane stress were shown to be possible by flipping the sample in the pressure holder and measuring through the glass substrate. The Faraday effect and stress-induced birefringence in the glass substrate did not hinder the accumulation of noiseless hysteresis data. The magnetoelastic effects appeared to be different for positive and negative values of the applied stress.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/93/10/8624/19282765/8624_1_online.pdf",""

In this study we propose a new procedure for mapping functional sites or regions of a candidate gene of interest using multiple linked SNPs. Based on a case-parent trio family design, we use expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm-derived haplotype frequency estimates of multiple tightly linked SNPs from both unambiguous and ambiguous families to construct a contingency statistic S for linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis. In the procedure, a moving-window scan for functional SNP sites or regions can cover an unlimited number of loci except for the limitation of computer storage. Within a window, all possible widths of haplotypes are utilized to find the maximum statistic S* for each site (or locus). Furthermore, this method can be applied to regional or genome-wide scanning for determining linkage disequilibrium using SNPs.

However, in 45% of the cases, these parameters were not related. These results support the view that the cardiac-related rhythm in MSNA reflects forcing of a nonlinear oscillator rather than periodic inhibition of unstructured, random activity.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpheart.00602.2002",""

Ten participants selected targets that varied in Target Type (with or without impenetrable borders), Width (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 cm), and Distance (2, 4, 8, 16, 32 cm). For a given width, targets with impenetrable borders were always selected faster than targets without impenetrable borders. Also, increasing the width of targets with impenetrable borders had little effect on selection time, whereas doing so when targets did not have impenetrable borders resulted in a substantial effect on selection time.

Here we describe an expression strategy in which the foreign sequences are linked to the gene encoding the 2A protease of foot-and-mouth disease virus and then inserted in frame between the capsid and E3 genes of Sindbis virus. During replication, the 2A fusion protein is synthesized as a component of the viral structural polyprotein that is then released by intramolecular cleavages mediated by the capsid and 2A proteases. Recombinant Sindbis viruses that expressed fusion proteins composed of 2A linked to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and to the VP7 protein of bluetongue virus were constructed. Viruses engineered to express GFP and VP7 from a duplicate 26S promoter were also constructed. All four viruses expressed the transgene and grew to similar titers in cultured cells. However, the GFP/2A- and VP7/2A-expressing viruses displayed greater expression stability and were less attenuated in newborn mice than the cognate double-subgenomic promoter-based viruses. By combining the two expression strategies, we constructed bivalent viruses that incorporated and expressed both transgenes. The bivalent viruses grew to lower titers in cultured cells and were essentially avirulent in newborn mice. Groups of mice were vaccinated with each VP7- and VP7/2A-expressing virus, and antibody responses to native VP7 were measured in an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Despite their genetic and phenotypic differences, all viruses induced similarly high titers of VP7-specific antibodies. These results demonstrate that 2A fusion protein-expressing alphaviruses may be particularly well suited for applications that require enduring expression of a single protein or coexpression of two alternative proteins.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.77.10.5598-5606.2003",""

There is a need for a Design Ideation Model that explains the variables and processes occurring during IG. Cognitive Science provides models and theories, but these are usually derived from simple tasks or problems. On the other hand, Design Research simulates real world design better, but experimentation at the design level is time consuming and is difficult to isolate due to interactions of the variables involved. This paper introduces an approach for the alignment of experiments at the design level with lab experiments in cognitive psychology. Two key concepts that make this alignment possible are: ideation components (mechanisms believed to promote IG) recognized in Design Research and Cognitive Science, and uniform measures. The long-term objective of this research is the creation of a Design Ideation Model; this will require the testing and modeling of several of these ideation components. This paper presents results from Design and Lab Experiments for a selected component: incubation. Results are discussed and their significance explained in the context of the Design Ideation Model. This study found that, based on the correlation at both the Lab and Design Experiments, incubation had a positive impact on Design Ideation. Further, the alignment approach followed proved to be appropriate for the individual modeling of ideation components.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/DETC2003/DTM-48679/2595010/847_1.pdf",""

The public museum serves as a model of public space. As traditional museums experience the challenges of storing and exhibiting physical objects (e.g., challenges of the systematic, mandatory, systemic, logistical, and strategic types), digitization is emerging as a player in the evolution of the public museum. The question of whether human interaction with digitized objects can be a substitute for our interaction with physical objects in physical space is taken up by this article.

Specifically, we find that compensation committees appear to: (1) completely shield initial and subsequent restructuring charges for CEOs with long tenure, provided that the firm had not recorded a charge in the two immediately prior years; (2) provide no shielding of subsequent restructuring charges taken by short-tenured CEOs if the firm reported a prior restructuring charge within two years of the current charge; (3) and partially shield the other categories of restructuring charges. Overall, this study provides evidence that compensation committees evaluate the context of each restructuring in determining the extent to which they will intervene to shield executive compensation from the effect of these charges.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article-pdf/78/1/169/18799/accr_2003_78_1_169.pdf",""

The authors have empirically identified an authoritarian-libertarian dimension of value change that captures an important dimension of this shift. They demonstrate that the shift from authoritarian to libertarian values is related to (a) growing levels of social and political alienation along a number of key attitudinal dimensions; (b) a dramatic shift in positions on the key culture wars issues; and (c) higher participatory levels and more assertive modes of political involvement, yielding asymmetric mobilization around the culture wars issues.

New stratigraphic evidence from Cascadia demonstrates that 13 earthquakes ruptured the entire margin from Vancouver Island to at least the California border since the eruption of the Mazama ash 7700 years ago. The 13 events above this prominent stratigraphic marker have an average repeat time of 600 years, and the youngest event ∼300 years ago coincides with the coastal record. We also extend the record of past earthquakes to the base of the Holocene (at least 9800 years ago), during which 18 events correlate along the same region. The sequence of Holocene events in Cascadia appears to contain a repeating pattern of events, a tantalizing first look at what may be the long-term behavior of a major fault system.","https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.earth.31.100901.141246",""

We find that these all-atom Lennard-Jones (6-12)+Coulomb representations, together with the usual Lorentz–Berthelot combining rules, fail to reproduce the weaker-than-anticipated interactions between these two classes of molecules. Systematic disagreements with experiment are found in the case of second pressure virial coefficients, gas solubilities, and liquid–liquid mixing properties. These discrepancies are not specific to the choice of OPLS–AA potentials, but are rather linked to the failure of the geometric mean combining rule for relating unlike atom interactions. In all cases examined, a reduction in the strength of cross H+F interactions by ∼25% relative to the geometric mean is required in order to achieve reasonable agreement with experiment. Several less commonly used combining rules were also examined. Although some of these rules are able to provide a reasonable description of the interactions among perfluoroalkane and alkane species, they fail to provide a consistent treatment when atoms other than C, H, and F are considered, as is necessary for modeling the interaction of the former molecules with rare-gas atoms.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/119/17/9145/19085707/9145_1_online.pdf",""

This study investigated the hypothesis that spectral resolution might be an additional factor influencing spectral fusion when the spectral information is split and presented dichotically to the two ears. To produce speech with varying degrees of spectral resolution, speech materials embedded in +5 dB S/N speech-shaped noise were processed through 6–12 channels and synthesized as a sum of sine waves. Two different methods of splitting the spectral information were investigated. In the first method, the odd-index channels were presented to one ear and the even-index channels to the other ear. In the second method the lower frequency channels were presented to one ear and the high-frequency channels to the other ear. Results indicated that spectral resolution did affect spectral fusion, and the effect differed across speech materials, with the sentences being affected the most. Sentences, processed through six or eight channels and presented dichotically in the low–high frequency condition were not fused as accurately as when presented monaurally. Sentences presented dichotically in the odd–even frequency condition were identified more accurately than when presented in the low–high condition.","https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article-pdf/114/1/475/8093023/475_1_online.pdf",""

Nodal involvement at different levels affects treatment. Thus identification of the degree of nodal involvement is important. Evaluation of the neck by conventional imaging modalities (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) is not completely accurate. Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning as a dynamic functional assessment may allow detection of multiple metastatic nodes at different levels. PURPOSE: We sought to compare the effectiveness of PET with pathologic examination for: presence, location, and number of cervical metastases in the clinically N‐positive neck. SETTING: Tertiary care academic facility. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 1994 to 1997, 15 patients with clinically N‐positive necks who had preoperative PET scans underwent 23 neck dissections. PET scans were correlated with the pathologic findings of the neck dissections in determining the ability to correctly identify the number and level(s) of nodal disease. RESULTS: When determining identification of the level of disease, PET demonstrated sensitivity of 81%; specificity, 99%; positive predictive value, 97%; negative predictive value, 90%; and accuracy, 92%. When evaluating the ability to correctly predict neck stage, PET demonstrated sensitivity of 86%, positive predictive value of 100%, and accuracy of 80% compared with clinical examination with sensitivity of 53% and accuracy of 53%. CONCLUSION: PET accurately identified disease in the N‐positive neck. Its ability to identify multiple level disease may allow it to help predict the selectivity of neck dissection in the therapeutic protocol.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1016/S0194-5998%2803%2900606-5",""

Nonetheless, notable exceptions to the general pattern exist, and it is well recognized that patterns may be dependent on characteristics of spatial scale and taxonomic hierarchy. We conducted an extensive survey of the literature and provide a synthetic assessment of the degree to which variation in patterns (positive linear, negative linear, modal, or nonsignificant) is a consequence of characteristics of scale (extent or focus) or taxon. In addition, we considered latitudinal gradients with respect to generic and familial richness, as well as species evenness and diversity. We provide a classification of the over 30 hypotheses advanced to account for the latitudinal gradient, and we discuss seven hypotheses with most promise for advancing ecological, biogeographic, and evolutionary understanding. We conclude with a forward-looking synthesis and list of fertile areas for future research.","https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.34.012103.144032",""

The process of replicating successful social innovations is both a prerequisite for dissemination (in order to assess the consistency of effects) and an obvious outcome of a successful dissemination effort. Fidelity, the extent to which a replicated program is implemented in a manner consistent with the original program model, is an important dimension of replication. This study was designed to provide empirical data related to three questions. Can complex social programs be implemented with fidelity? How much fidelity is appropriate or desired? What are the organizational dynamics of adoption with fidelity? Data were collected from grantees of a national replication initiative funded by the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention. Data suggest that high fidelity can be achieved, at least in the context in which programs are mandated to do so as part of the funding agreement and are given technical assistance in achieving fidelity. Secondly, programs perceived high fidelity as having positive effects on the program and its participants, a finding consistent with a limited assessment of the relationship of program outcomes and fidelity. Finally, much was learned about the human and organizational dynamics of replicating with fidelity. Implications for policy and direction regarding replication are discussed.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1023%2FB:AJCP.0000004753.88247.0d",""

Successful reproduction is so important that mammals invoke a battery of protective mechanisms for the germ cell lineages that function to maximize genetic integrity while still allowing genetic diversity and adaptation. Protective mechanisms likely include, but are not limited to, robust DNA repair to safeguard genetic integrity and apoptosis to remove cells with intolerable levels of DNA damage. Analyses of spontaneous mutant frequencies are generally consistent with germline DNA being stringently maintained relative to somatic tissues. Despite the rigorous protection afforded germ cells, genetic integrity is observed to decline with increased maternal and paternal age. It is not yet clear whether cells in the germ line truly age or whether other processes decline or become dysfunctional with age. For example, in a younger animal, the differentiation and/or utilization of germ cells with lower genetic integrity might be disallowed, whereas in an older animal, such cells might slip past these quality-control mechanisms.","https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sageke.2003.8.pe4",""

In the new view, learning is defined as the development that results from social interaction that affords learners increased access to roles in expert performances. Accepting the dual cognitive-social nature of learning creates a new problem for instructors: designing learning experiences that meld the cognitive and social aspects without subordinating either to the other. This article addresses the problem by presenting, justifying, and exemplifying an approach to designing learning experiences that support learners' development of capabilities so that they learn to do without assistance things that they could initially do only with assistance. The goal of this design approach is for learners to develop capabilities that they first experience in assisted or collaborative learning situations. Formally, this approach comprises designing learning experiences within learners' zones of proximal development (ZPDs), “the distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers” (see Vygotsky 1978, 86).

In neurobiology, studies of the human brain have been expanding rapidly by use of functional genomics techniques. To enhance these studies and allow use of a porcine brain model, a normalized porcine brain cDNA library (PBL) has been generated and used as a base for EST discovery and microarray generation. In this report, we discuss initial sequence analysis of 965 clones from this resource. Our data revealed that library normalization successfully reduced the number of clones representing highly abundant cDNA species and overall clone redundancy. Cluster analysis revealed over 800 unique cDNA species representing a redundancy rate for the normalized library of 6.9% compared with 29.4% before normalization. Sequence information, BLAST results, and TIGR cluster matches for these ESTs are publicly available via a web-accessible database ( http://nbfgc.msu.edu ). A cDNA microarray was created using 877 unique porcine brain EST amplicons spotted in triplicate on glass slides. This microarray was assessed by performing a series of experiments designed to test hybridization efficiency and false-positive rate. Our results indicate that the PBL cDNA microarray is a robust tool for studies of brain gene expression using swine as a model system.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/physiolgenomics.00099.2003",""

One underlying theme is the asymmetry between the negative and the positive features of social activities, the negative being more readily identifiable empirically than the positive. A corollary theme, building on the observations of George Herbert Mead, is: one engages the present through experience; one engages the future through ideas. Furthermore, as Anthony Giddens, Ulrich Beck, and Niklas Luhmann suggest, we in late modernity seem to be facing a future that is more contingent than it was in early modernity. After articulating the foundations of the mode of inquiry we term “countersystem analysis,” we employ Karl Mannheim as a point of departure for critically surveying a constellation of scholars—conservatives as well as reformers—who have relied upon some version of countersystem analysis in addressing the future.

The principal plays a critical role in creating an inclusive environment that determines how groups are formed, the emotional climate of the workplace, and how roles are structured.

The solution approach is based on Lagrangean decomposition and is seen to provide extremely good advertisement schedules in a relatively short period of time, taking only a few hundred seconds of elapsed time on a 450 MHz PC compared to a few thousand seconds of CPU time on a workstation that other approaches need. Additionally, this approach can be incorporated into an actual implementation with minimal alterations and hence is of particular interest.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/945846.945848",""

Sixty-four experienced auditors completed two hypothetical cases, one involving disclosure of a contingent liability and the other involving the collectibility of a customer account. The findings suggest that audit judgments regarding contingent liability disclosure may be biased toward a client's preference if the preference is received prior to evidence evaluation (i.e., an early preference) but not if the preference is received at the end of the evidence evaluation process (i.e., a late preference). No such bias, however, is present for the collectibility judgment. Results also indicate that auditors who receive an early preference ask to examine more additional audit evidence than those who receive a late preference, although whether they seek additional evidence to confirm or disconfirm the client's preference remains unclear. Finally, no support is found for the ordinal interaction hypothesizing that only a highly credible client in the early preference condition will differentially influence contingent liability disclosure and accounts receivable collectibility judgments.","https://publications.aaahq.org/ajpt/article-pdf/22/1/143/45968/aud_2003_22_1_143.pdf",""

Using nationally representative longitudinal data and hierarchical linear modeling, this article explored the association between students' mathematics course work and states' high school graduation requirements and assessment or accountability policies. We found that students in states with more graduation requirements tended to enroll in higher level mathematics courses as freshmen and persist to take more advanced level courses. Similar trends were also found for students in states that link test performance to consequences for schools. Extensive testing, however, had little effect on course taking except to increase differences based on socioeconomic status. In contrast, differences between racial or ethnic groups tended to be smaller in states where test performance was linked to consequences for students.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3102/01623737025003299",""

No support was found for either prediction. However, a contingency theory-based hypothesis was supported. A moderation effect indicated that racial diversity’s association with performance was contingent on firms’ level of innovation. Specifically, racial diversity enhanced performance for banks pursuing an innovation strategy, whereas for banks low in innovation, performance declined. The results suggest that a racially diverse workforce in conjunction with an innovation-focused business strategy may provide firms a competitive advantage. This study thus supports a contingency/resource-based perspective that states that racial diversity, as a knowledge-based resource, needs to be set in an appropriate context to fully realize its potential benefits.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1059601102250022",""

Bacteria were cultured from the phloem of crown sections of symptomatic plants of Citrullus lanatas and Cucurbita pepo. Those bacteria testing positive in CYVD-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were all gram negative and appeared morphologically identical, producing creamy white, smooth, entire, convex colonies on Luria-Bertani or nutrient agar. Characterized cucurbit-derived strains of Serratia marcescens were introduced into greenhouse-grown squash plants by puncture inoculation and into field-grown squash plants by enclosure with S. marcescens-fed squash bugs, Anasa tristis. Up to 60% of the bacteria-inoculated plants in the greenhouse and up to 17% of field plants caged with inoculative squash bugs developed phloem discoloration and tested positive for S. marcescens by CYVD-specific PCR. None of the controls developed phloem discoloration or tested positive by PCR. Of the diseased field plants, 12% (2 of 35) also yellowed, wilted, and collapsed, exhibiting full symptom development of CYVD. However, neither plant collapse nor decline was observed in the greenhouse-grown, puncture-inoculated plants. The morphology, growth habit, and PCR reaction of bacteria cultured from crown tissue of a subset of plants in each experimental group were indistinguishable from those of the inoculum bacteria. Evidence presented from our studies confirms that the squash bug can transmit S. marcescens, the CYVD causal bacterium. The S. marcescens-A. tristis relationship described here is the first instance in which the squash bug has been identified as a vector of a plant pathogen.

Two LHRH fusion proteins, ovalbumin with seven LHRH peptides (OV-LHRH-7), and thioredoxin with seven LHRH peptides (TH-LHRH-7) were used in a cocktail vaccine. Two groups of male TRAMP mice were immunized with the cocktail. Primary immunizations were at either 4 or 8 weeks of age. LHRH immunized mice ( n = 19) were compared with castrated ( n = 19) and intact mice ( n = 18) for testosterone concentration, tumor weight, and lifespan. Immunization against LHRH in the TRAMP mice resulted in significant production of antibodies to LHRH compared with surgically castrated and intact control mice. Testicular weight was significantly reduced in the LHRH immunized groups compared with intact control mice. Serum testosterone was reduced ( P < 0.05) in the immunized mice compared with intact control mice and was not different from that of castrated mice ( P > 0.05). Tumor weight was variable and inconsistent throughout all treatment groups. Lifespan was not increased by immunization against LHRH or castration. Intact control mice (lived the longest (227 ± 11 days), whereas immunized mice lived 206 ± 11 days and castrated mice lived 213 ± 13 days. Tumors from immunized TRAMP mice appeared more aggressive than tumors of castrated and intact mice, as demonstrated by 35% expression of gross lung tumors in the immunized mice whereas none were observed in the castrated or intact TRAMP mice. Prostate cancer is initially dependent upon androgens for growth and development, but cells have the ability to escape androgen dependence and progress to an androgen independent state, which was evident in this study.

However, to the simulation practitioner, the modeling convenience and functionality provided by a canceling construct is important. This is clearly demonstrated by the presence of some sort of event-canceling construct in all the major simulation software packages.

Calculations of excitation energies and oscillator strengths are reported using excited-state coupled cluster response methods, as well as the complete active space self-consistent field method with the full Breit–Pauli spin-orbit operator. The calculations predict that there is only one singlet state for BrONO2, the Ã 1A″ state, that is accessible at wavelengths longer than 300 nm. At energies below the first singlet state, i.e., λ&gt;330 nm, the calculations reveal two triplet states with significant oscillator strength. Therefore, we propose that the origin of absorption in the long wavelength region from 350 to 500 nm, responsible for the majority of atmospheric photolysis, is due to transitions to triplet states and not singlet states. A comparison of the reported benchmark coupled cluster calculations (CCSD) with the results of (1) configuration interaction with all single substitutions and a perturbative correction for the double substitutions [CIS(D)] and (2) time-dependent density-functional (TDDF) calculations is provided. For the lowest energy excitations, CIS(D) calculations provide quantitative agreement with the CCSD results, while TDDF calculations yield qualitative agreement.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/119/15/7864/19005120/7864_1_online.pdf",""

A theoretical approach is presented which explicitly takes into account the effect of the nanopore length and diameter for polymer motion across the membrane. It is shown that the length of the pore is crucial for polymer translocation dynamics. The present model predicts that for realistic conditions (long nanopores and large external fields) there are two regimes of translocation depending on polymer size: for polymer chains larger than the pore length, the velocity of translocation is nearly constant, while for polymer chains smaller than the pore length the velocity increases with decreasing polymer size.

For low annulus rotation rates the Rossby number was of order unity and the flow was three-dimensional (3D), but at high rotation rates the Rossby number was only about 0.1, comparable to the value for oceans and the atmosphere on large length scales. The low Rossby number (quasi-geostrophic) flow was nearly two-dimensional (2D), as expected from the Taylor–Proudman theorem. For the 3D flow we found that the probability distribution function (PDF) for velocity differences along the direction of the flow, δv(d)=v(x0+d)−v(x0), was Gaussian for large separations d and non-Gaussian (with exponential tails) for small d, as has been found for nonrotating turbulent flows. However, for low Rossby number flow, the PDF was self-similar (independent of d) and non-Gaussian. The exponents characterizing the structure functions, Sp=〈(δv)p〉∼dζp were obtained by the extended self-similarity method. For 3D flow the exponents departed from p/3 with increasing p, as has been found for turbulence in nonrotating flows, while for the quasi-2D turbulent flow, the exponents increased linearly with p, as expected for a self-similar flow. We applied the β-test of the hierarchical structure model [She and Lévêque, Phys. Rev. Lett. 72, 336 (1994)] and found that β remained constant at β≃0.75 as the rotation was increased from the 3D to the 2D regime; this indicates that both the quasi-2D and 3D flows are highly intermittent. The PIV images provided another indication of the intermittency—both the quasi-2D and 3D flows had coherent vortices which could be distinguished from the background flow. We also applied the γ-test of the hierarchical structure model and found that γ increased from 0.18 for the 3D flow to 0.34 for the quasi-2D flow; the latter value is in accord with expectation for self-similar turbulence.

The absorption spectra include the details of the crystal-field splitting of 11 multiplet manifolds, LJ2S+1 of Er3+(4f11), spanning the wavelength range between 350 nm and 1550 nm. The crystal-field splitting of the ground-state I15/24, is obtained from an analysis of the fluorescence spectrum, S3/24→I15/24. Spectra are characterized by inhomogeneous broadening due to the disordered crystal structure in which different valency cations, Na+ and Bi3+, statistically fill the S4 symmetry sites. The Er3+ ions likely replace the Bi3+ ions in these sites. A quasi-center model has been chosen to interpret the crystal-field splitting of each manifold, using D2d rather than S4 symmetry as the site for the rare-earth ion in the lattice. To test the feasibility of the model, the splitting of the energy levels of Nd3+ in NBW was carried out first and compared with experimental levels reported in literature. A least-squares fitting analysis between 26 calculated-to-observed energy (Stark) levels gave a root-mean-square (rms) deviation of 8 cm−1 for the IJ4 and F3/24 multiplet manifolds of Nd3+ in NBW. Using the phenomenological lattice-sum parameters, Anm, obtained from the analysis of the Nd3+ energy levels, we predicted an initial set of crystal-field parameters, Bnm, for Er3+. With only a modest fitting of the multiplet centroids, these Bnm predict the observed splitting in the Er3+ spectra remarkably well. In a fitting of the energy levels in which both the Bnm and centroids are allowed to vary, we obtained a rms deviation of 6 cm−1 for 57 calculated-to-observed Stark levels. The results suggest that the quasi-center model has merit when used to calculate the crystal-field splitting of the energy levels of the trivalent rare-earth ions in crystal hosts having a disordered structure.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/94/11/7128/18704997/7128_1_online.pdf",""

However in cases where resources are available to characterize a particular piece of the environment at the scales of acoustic importance, these measurements may be used to predict the uncertainty of propagation and reverberation in nearby regions as long as the bottom and oceanographic processes are homogeneous over the length scale covering the two sites. In these cases stochastic treatments of the environmental variability at fine scales may be employed and a resulting uncertainty on acoustic propagation and reverberation predicted. Here the uncertainty of acoustic propagation and reverberation due to fine scale sound speed profile variability associated with internal waves and seafloor heterogeneity is evaluated using Monte-Carlo techniques. Results show that for the New Jersey and Eel river STRATAFORM sites seafloor variability leads to predictions of reverberation uncertainty of less than 1 dB at 4 kHz, while oceanographic variability due to internal waves is predicted to cause about 2 dB of uncertainty in the same frequency regime.

The plan specification provides the agents with a shared mental model for how they are supposed to collaborate with each other to achieve the common goal. Making sure that the plans are reliable and fit for the purpose for which they are designed is a critical problem with this approach. To address this problem, this paper presents a formal approach to modeling and analyzing multi-agent behaviors using Predicate/Transition (PrT) nets, a high- level formalism of Petri nets. We model a multi-agent problem by representing agent capabilities as transitions in PrT nets. To analyze a multi-agent PrT model, we adapt the planning graphs as a compact structure for reachability analysis, which is coherent to the concurrent semantics. We also demonstrate that one can analyze whether parallel actions specified in multi-agent plans can be executed in parallel and whether the plans can achieve the goal by analyzing the dependency relations among the transitions in the PrT model.","https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S0218194003001184",""

The results indicated that elderly adults' friction demand (RCOF) was not significantly different from the young and middle-aged adults. The older adults, however, fell more often than the other age groups. Fall recovery threshold (FRT) measures indicated that younger adults were able to recover from a slip (thus preventing a fall) with higher sliding speeds and longer slip distances than older adults. Additionally, older adults' adjusted friction utilization (AFU) on the slippery floor surface was not adjusted within the dynamic friction requirements, resulting in more falls.

The current study investigates the expression and function of SCaMPER in cardiomyocytes. Northern analyses and RT-PCR cloning and sequencing revealed SCaMPER expression in both human and rat cardiac tissue. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses demonstrated that SCaMPER is abundant in cardiac tissue and is localized to the sarcotubular junction. This was confirmed by the colocalization of SCaMPER with dihydropyridine and ryanodine receptors by confocal microscopy. Purified T tubules were shown to contain SCaMPER and immunoelectron micrographs suggested that SCaMPER is located to the junctional T tubules, but a junctional SR localization cannot be ruled out. The sphingolipid ligand for SCaMPER, sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC), initiated calcium release from the cardiomyocyte SR. Importantly, antisense knockdown of SCaMPER mRNA produced a substantial reduction of sphingolipid-induced calcium release, suggesting that SCaMPER is a potentially important calcium channel of cardiomyocytes.","https://journals.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpcell.00382.2002",""

In fall and winter, ∼10 to 20% of the aerosol Al, a commonly used indicator of mineral dust, is attributable to recycled sea salt, but the dust fluxes then are small, and longer‐term averages show a recycling effect of only 1 to 5% on dry deposition. The percentage of recycled Fe appears to be even less than for Al.

The physics of advection and diffusion is analyzed, and requirements for combining advection and diffusion are presented. Advection is defined here as transport responding to a pressure gradient or body force. Molecular diffusion is defined as transport responding to concentration or thermal gradients. Diffusion represents an average velocity component of molecules of a particular constituent relative to a fixed frame of reference external to the solution, rather than to the mean velocity of all constituents in a solution as defined in current literature.

The objective of this study was to compare the roasted peanut flavor qualities of Georgia Green to those of the long-time industry standard Florunner. This study also provided an opportunity to further expand investigations into the parent selection effects on progeny roasted peanut flavor quality. A total of 192 samples of cultivars Florunner, Georgia Green, and Georgia Greens parents, Southern Runner and Sunbelt Runner, were collected from 1986 to 2000 from the Southeast, Southwest, and Virginia-Carolina peanut production regions. A descriptive sensory panel evaluated flavor attributes of a roasted sound mature kernel (SMK) sample from each plot. The sensory attributes of the four genotypes were compared directly, and the data were included in a Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) model of breeding value of 112 peanut cultivars and breeding lines. Georgia Green was not significantly different from the industry standard cultivar Florunner in the sensory attributes roasted peanut [4.5 vs. 4.1 flavor intensity units (fiu), ns], bitter (3.2 vs. 3.3 fiu, ns), and astringent (3.3 vs. 3.4 fiu, ns).

This discontinuity has been implicated as a basis for boundaries between speech categories distinguished by VOT. Here, we investigate how this discontinuity interacts with the learning of novel perceptual categories. Adult listeners were trained to categorize a nonspeech acoustic cue that mimics the temporal distinction of VOT. One group of listeners learned categories with a boundary coincident with the perceptual discontinuity. Another group learned categories defined such that the perceptual discontinuity fell within a category. Listeners in the latter group required significantly more experience to reach criterion categorization performance. The evidence of interactions between the perceptual discontinuity and the learned categories extended to generalization tests as well. It has been hypothesized that languages make use of perceptual discontinuities to promote perceptual distinctiveness among sounds within a language inventory. The present data suggest that these influences interact with category learning. As such, learnability may play a predictive role in selection of language sound inventories. Moreover, it may be possible to observe predictable learning effects in infant speech perception.","https://pubs.aip.org/jasa/article/113/4_Supplement/2255/470901/Perceptual-discontinuities-and-categorization",""

The main goal for this endeavor was to provide a queue-detection system that will prevent or reduce rear-end collisions and will also provide motorists with real-time information about potential backups caused by lane closures. After each system was installed, a general evaluation of the basic design was conducted. Knowledge gained was applied to each subsequent system, to improve the design and to provide increased effectiveness, reliability, and practicality. The design evolution of these systems is presented, the design development is discussed in detail, and the effectiveness of two of the automated work zone information systems installed on Interstate rehabilitation projects in Arkansas is evaluated. The systems used were ADAPTIR from Scientex Corporation and CHIPS from ASTI Transportation Systems. These systems included all hardware, software, and other equipment necessary for collecting, displaying, and processing traffic condition data.

By modeling the B depth profiles, we calculated the B diffusivities through Hf-silicate (HfSixOy) to be ∼2× higher than the corresponding diffusivities for Hf-silicon oxynitride (HfSixOyNz). B diffusion through grain boundaries after HfSixOy crystallization is believed to be responsible for the enhanced B diffusivity observed. Suppression of crystallization observed in HfSixOyNz films is attributed to the lower Hf content in the films and the incorporation of N. The decreased B penetration observed in HfSixOyNz is a combination of absence of grain boundaries and the fact that N blocks B diffusion by occluding diffusion pathways. The minimum temperatures for B penetration are estimated to be approximately 950 and 1050 °C for HfSixOy and HfSixOyNz, respectively.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article-pdf/82/26/4669/18579271/4669_1_online.pdf",""

Six age-matched nondiabetic subjects served as control subjects. RSG improved fasting plasma glucose (185 ± 8 to 139 ± 5 mg/dl), mean plasma glucose during the OGTT (290 ± 9 to 225 ± 6 mg/dl), HbA1c (8.5 ± 0.3 to 7.1 ± 0.3%), insulin-mediated total-body glucose disposal (TGD) (6.9 ± 0.7 to 9.2 ± 0.8 mg · kg−1 fat-free mass · min−1) (all P &lt; 0.001), and decreased fasting plasma free fatty acid (FFA) (789 ± 59 to 656 ± 50 μEq/l) and mean FFA during the OGTT (644 ± 41 to 471 ± 35 μEq/l) (both P &lt; 0.01). Before RSG treatment, insulin infusion did not significantly increase insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation (0.95 ± 0.10 to 1.08 ± 0.13 density units; NS) but had a small stimulatory effect on insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 tyrosine phosphorylation (1.05 ± 0.10 to 1.21 ± 0.12 density units; P &lt; 0.01) and the association of p85 with IRS-1 (0.94 ± 0.06 to 1.08 ± 0.06 activity units; P &lt; 0.01). RSG therapy had no effect on basal or insulin-stimulated insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation but increased insulin stimulation of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation (1.13 ± 0.11 to 1.56 ± 0.17 density units; P &lt; 0.01 vs. prerosiglitazone) and p85 association with IRS-1 (1.00 ± 0.06 to 1.27 ± 0.07 activity units; P &lt; 0.05 vs. prerosiglitazone). In control and type 2 diabetic subjects, TGD/nonoxidative glucose disposal correlated positively with the insulin-stimulated increments in IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation (r = 0.52/r = 0.57, P &lt; 0.01) and inversely with the plasma FFA concentration during the insulin clamp (r = −0.55/r = −0.53, P &lt; 0.01). However, no significant association between plasma FFA concentrations during the insulin clamp and the increment in either IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation or the association of p85 with IRS-1 was observed.

As a result of thermionic electron emission and photoionization, nanoparticles produced in this manner were highly charged. The resulting aerosol was primarily composed of nanometer sized particles. The charged nanoparticles were deflected by an electric field that was perpendicular to the aerosol flow. Deflected nanoparticles were deposited directly into n-nonanoic acid flowing along the negative collection electrode. Suspensions of nanoparticles collected in this manner were dark gray in color and were found to be flocculated. When the suspensions were heated to temperatures above 75 °C, a color change from gray to clear was observed. Ultraviolet/visible extinction spectroscopy was performed on each suspension following annealing at different temperatures and times. By modeling the absorption decrease as a first order reaction, a good fit for the data was found. Analysis by dynamic light scattering (DLS) showed that the initial mean flocculent size of the gray suspensions was 602 nm. DLS analysis of the suspensions taken at different annealing intervals showed that the flocculent size decreased, but maintained a narrow size distribution until the size shrank below the instrument resolution limit. The reduction in flocculent size coincided with the observed color change, and an irreversible transition to a deflocculated primary nanoparticle suspension is observed. Surface enhanced Raman scattering is used to confirm that the reaction results from a change in the orientation of the nonanoic molecule on the surface of the nanoparticle.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/119/13/6802/19151722/6802_1_online.pdf",""

The cost for a single NGL tool could exceed $50M in the next few years, a prohibitive number for many companies. As a result, several researchers are looking at low cost alternative methods for printing sub-100 nm features. In the mid-1990’s, several research groups started investigating different methods for imprinting small features. Many of these methods, although very effective at printing small features across an entire wafer, are limited in their ability to do precise overlay. In 1999, Colburn et al. [Proc. SPIE 379 (1999)] discovered that imprinting could be done at low pressures and at room temperatures by using low viscosity UV curable monomers. The technology is typically referred to as step and flash imprint lithography. The use of a quartz template enabled the photocuring process to occur and also opened up the potential for optical alignment of the wafer and template.

While diethylsilane was used as the source for the preparation of SiC films, hydrogen, argon and helium were used as dilution gases in different concentrations. The effects of Td, GFR and dilution gases on the structural and optical properties of these films were investigated using high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), micro-Raman, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and ultraviolet-visible optical absorption techniques. Detailed analysis of the FTIR spectra indicates the onset of formation of SiC nanocrystals embedded in the amorphous matrix of the films deposited at a temperature of 300 °C. The degree of crystallization increases with increasing Td and the crystalline fraction (fc) is 65%±2.2% at 575 °C. The fc is the highest for the films deposited with hydrogen dilution in comparison with the films deposited with argon and helium at the same Td. The Raman spectra also confirm the occurrence of crystallization in these films. The HRTEM measurements confirm the existence of nanocrystallites in the amorphous matrix with a wide variation in the crystallite size from 2 to 10 nm. These results are in reasonable agreement with the FTIR and the micro-Raman analysis. The variation of refractive index (n) with Td is found to be quite consistent with the structural evolution of these films. The films deposited with high dilution of H2 have large band gap (Eg) and these values vary from 2.6 to 4.47 eV as Td is increased from 80 to 575 °C. The size dependent shift in the Eg value has also been investigated using effective mass approximation. Thus, the observed large band gap is attributed to the presence of nanocrystallites in the films.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/94/8/5252/18704785/5252_1_online.pdf",""

However, we use these Vp/Vs ratios to correct the interpretation and perform an initial registration of the P-S volume to P-P two-way time. An analysis of the registered, or ""warped"", P-S volume shows the limitations of this simple technique, and from this we infer what processes must be addressed for a robust method of registration.","http://onepetro.org/OTCONF/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.4043/15118-MS/1870414/otc-15118-ms.pdf",""

Spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements indicate that, upon pressurization and depressurization with CO2, the thickness and refractive index return to values near the original values indicating that collapse or voiding of the pores did not occur. Post-etch residue could not be removed by pure water, CO2, with or without cosolvent, or dry CO2 with a surfactant. These results suggest that the particles could not be removed by a dissolution mechanism alone. The via and the bottom trench were cleaned with a solvent containing water, CO2, and a hydrocarbon surfactant. In this mild detergent system, particles may be removed both as a suspension and in the dissolved state in microemulsions and macroemulsions. The low interfacial tension prevents collapse of the pMSQ during water removal. This mild detergent system does not produce voids in the pMSQ. Thus, this detergent cleaning technique appears to be selective for post-ash residues on pMSQ dielectrics and is of significant practical interest.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-pdf/21/6/2590/8206075/2590_1_online.pdf",""

This paper focuses on the seismic refraction data and constraints these data place on the three‐dimensional structure of the island arc backstop. We find that the backstop in this region contains considerable topography in both the strike and dip directions. Two ridges, each 25–35 km in length and ∼10 km in width, rise 1–6 km above the adjacent basement. The eastern edge of one of the ridges deepens by ∼4–6 km over a horizontal distance of 10 km and forms the eastern edge of the backstop. In contrast to the complex nature of the backstop, the adjacent accretionary wedge displays little lateral variability at large scales. This may be a consequence of the spatial scales involved: the backstop topography is ∼10–35 km in width, while the accretionary wedge extends ∼125 km from the deformation front to the backstop. The top of the subducting oceanic crust, as identified by an increase in velocities to 6–6.5 km/s, intersects the backstop at a depth of ∼14–15 km. The updip limit of plate boundary seismicity is located 75–100 km west and downdip of the backstop. However, two earthquake clusters are observed at the intersection of the subducted Barracuda Ridge and Tiburon Ridge with the backstop, suggesting active deformation associated with the backstop edge at these locations.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2002JB002243",""

To assess the effect of the menstrual cycle on fluorescence spectroscopy, daily measurements were made on ten subjects for the length of their cycle. These measurements were analyzed to determine if there was a statistically significant signal associated with the menstrual cycle. A signal was found for emission wavelengths between 425 and 445 nm inclusive—near the main hemoglobin absorption band, the Soret band, at 420 nm. We suspect that the slight displacement of the Soret band is due to the nearby dominant NAD(P)H peak, which increases the signal-to-noise ratio and affects statistical significance. The signal consists of a reduction in fluorescence intensity for the first few days of the cycle. This analysis indicates that hemoglobin absorption is the main menstrual-cycle effect on the use of fluorescence spectroscopy on the cervix. The effect is confined to a small set of excitation/emission wavelengths and to approximately the first 8 days of the cycle. This suggests that any problems from the menstrual cycle can be avoided with a simple requirement that the device not be used during the period of menstrual bleeding.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1366/000370203321165223",""

The different cost functions, measured sound speed profiles, and measured time series result in different inverted geoacoustic profiles from which transmission loss is generated for comparison with measurements.

We used a combination of two‐dimensional seismic tomography and ray tracing to constrain velocity structure in the region. Thinnest crust is located within the interpreted neovolcanic zone, but the crustal thickness of 10–15 km indicates that rifting has not progressed to the formation of normal oceanic crust. Crust thickens to 20–26 km along the South Shetland Islands pedestal and to 14–20 km along the Antarctic Peninsula margin. Along‐strike, crust generally thickens from the NE to the SW. In the across‐strike direction, crustal thinning is observed over a broader area in the NE than in the SW. The observed crustal thickness pattern is consistent with propagation of extension from the NE toward the SW. Upper mantle velocities of 7.45 ± 0.2 km/s indicate either the presence of a small amount of partial melt or normal upper mantle anisotropy with the slow direction parallel to the rift axis. Large lateral changes in upper crustal velocities along the Antarctic Peninsula margin correspond with seismically imaged structural boundaries. There is no correlation between these structural boundaries and large velocity changes or morphologic steps observed within the present‐day neovolcanic zone. We suggest that the rift topography now characterizing the Antarctic Peninsula margin formed prior to the formation of the modern basin.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2003JB002468",""

Results show that the fast polarization directions are sub‐parallel to North American absolute plate motion. The largest deviations from the plate motion are observed within the western edge of the Great Plains and in the interior of the Colorado Plateau where lithospheric anisotropy may be significant.

Calculations are presented for typical working gases used in thermoacoustic engines at standard temperature and pressure. In channels that are very wide in comparison with the viscous penetration depth, which is the Rayleigh streaming regime, the influence of the two thermal effects is comparable but small. The same is true in very narrow channels, having widths on the order of the viscous penetration depth. In channels having intermediate widths, 10–20 times the viscous penetration depth, the effect of heat conduction can be substantial.

Previous studies have elegantly described the physiological modulation of the regenerative process in response to muscle injury, but the molecular response that characterizes stages of the repair process remains ill-defined. The recent completion of the Human and Mouse Genome Projects and the advent of technologies such as high-density oligonucleotide array analysis facilitate an expanded analysis of complex processes such as muscle regeneration. In the present study, we define cellular and molecular events that characterize stages of muscle injury and regeneration. Utilization of transcriptional profiling strategies revealed coordinated expression of growth factors [i.e., Tgfb1, Igf1, Egf, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 6 and 7], the fetal myogenic program (Myod1, Myf5, Myf6), and the biomatrix (procollagen genes, Mmp3, Mmp9, biglycan, periostin) during muscle regeneration. Corroboration of the transcriptional profiling analysis included quantitative real-time RT-PCR and in situ hybridization analyses of selected candidate genes. In situ hybridization studies for periostin [osteoblast-specific factor 2 (fasciclin I-like)] and biglycan revealed that these genes are restricted to mesenchymal derivatives during embryogenesis and are significantly regulated during regeneration of the injured hindlimb skeletal muscle. We conclude that muscle regeneration is a complex process that requires the coordinated modulation of the inflammatory response, myogenic progenitor cells, growth factors, and ECM for complete restoration of muscle architecture.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/physiolgenomics.00056.2003",""

As an intense surface acoustic wave (SAW) propagates, the temporal evolution of the wave shape provides information on the nonlinear acoustic parameters and the nonlinear elastic constants of the material. The nonlinear propagation of SAW pulses exhibits different types of nonlinear behavior depending on nonlinear acoustic constants. Changes of a SAW pulse shape were calculated using a nonlinear evolution equation. Measurements of SAW pulses in polycrystalline stainless steel have demonstrated that a compression of the pulse takes place in this material corresponding to a positive parameter of the local nonlinearity, which was evaluated by fitting the parameters of the evolution equation to the experimental data. Numerical simulations of a dispersive propagation of nonlinear SAWs in a system comprised of a substrate with a film were performed. A formation of a relatively stable portion of the waveform was found in agreement with recent observations of soliton-like SAW pulses.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/rsi/article-pdf/74/1/448/19279751/448_1_online.pdf",""

After updating the SSB model for Jason the trend remained, which pointed to an error in the TOPEX model. Since two different TOPEX altimeters (TOPEX_A and TOPEX_B) have operated during the mission, we estimated new SSB models using data from each one. The estimated SSB model for TOPEX_B is significantly different than the model provided with the data, which was estimated using only TOPEX_A data. Replacing the SSB model on TOPEX with the new TOPEX_A and TOPEX_B models not only removes the correlation with SWH in the Jason‐TOPEX SSH residuals, it also removes most of a bias between TOPEX_A and TOPEX_B that has been observed in tide gauge calibrations. The magnitude of the change between TOPEX_A SSH and TOPEX_B SSH is of the order of 10 mm globally, with TOPEX_B SSH increasing when the new SSB model is applied.

The accepted treatment involves hypertensive, hypervolemic, hemodilution therapy. However, there is variation in the application of this treatment. Most authors increase mean arterial pressure (MAP), which can be associated with significant morbidity. Others increase cardiac output (CO). In this study, we examined the relationship between volume status, CO, and MAP and cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the setting of vasospasm. METHODS: A xenon blood flow tomography-based system was used to quantitate CBF. Sixteen patients with vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage were treated with hypervolemia, phenylephrine to increase MAP, or dobutamine to increase CO. Direct CBF measurements were obtained before and after treatment. A strength of this study is that only one variable (central venous pressure, MAP, or CO) was manipulated in each patient, and the effect of this change was measured immediately. RESULTS: With phenylephrine, mean MAP increased from 102.4 to 132.1 mm Hg. In regions of diminished CBF due to vasospasm, mean CBF increased from 19.2 to 33.7 ml/100 g/min. Similarly, dobutamine increased the cardiac index from a mean of 4.1 to 6.0 L/min/m2 and slightly decreased MAP. CBF increased from a mean of 24.8 to 35.4 ml/100 g/min. Both were statistically significant changes. With hypervolemia, the average central venous pressure increased from a mean of 5.4 to 7.3 cm H2O; no changes in mean CBF were noted. CONCLUSION: This article reports the first human study that shows with direct measurements the independent influence of CO in the setting of vasospasm. Increases in CO without changes in MAP can elevate CBF. This finding has immediate clinical application because CO manipulation is much safer than increasing MAP. Because both interventions were equally efficacious, our protocol has been changed to augment CO as a first measure. Induced hypertension is reserved for patients in whom this initial treatment fails.","http://academic.oup.com/neurosurgery/article-pdf/53/5/1044/32558283/00006123-200311000-00005.pdf",""

In the case of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon present in tobacco smoke, the atherogenic response involves interference with redox homeostasis by oxidative intermediates of BaP metabolism. The present studies were conducted to define genomic profiles and predictive gene biological networks associated with the atherogenic response of murine (aortic) VSMCs to BaP. A combined oxidant-antioxidant treatment regimen was used to identify redox-sensitive targets during the early course of the atherogenic response. Gene expression profiles were defined using cDNA microarrays coupled to analysis of variance and several clustering methodologies. A predictor algorithm was then applied to gain insight into critical gene-gene interactions during atherogenesis. Supervised and nonsupervised analyses identified clones highly regulated by BaP, unaffected by antioxidant, and neutralized by combined chemical treatments. Lymphocyte antigen-6 complex, histocompatibility class I component factors, secreted phosphoprotein, and several interferon-inducible proteins were identified as novel redox-regulated targets of BaP. Predictor analysis confirmed these relationships and identified immune-related genes as critical molecular targets of BaP. Redox-dependent patterns of gene deregulation indicate that oxidative stress plays a prominent role during the early stages of BaP-induced atherogenesis.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/physiolgenomics.00006.2003",""

Furthermore, in an analogous fashion to breast and prostate cancer, certain GI cancers possess receptors for GI hormones; growth can be altered by administration of these hormones or by blocking their respective receptors. The GI hormones that affect proliferation, either stimulatory or inhibitory, include gastrin, cholecystokinin, gastrin-releasing peptide, neurotensin, peptide YY, glucagon-like peptide-2, and somatostatin. The effects of these peptides on normal and neoplastic GI tissues will be described.

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is a diagnostic tool with a reported sensitivity of 70%. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and specificity of BAL in severely burned pediatric patients. An analysis was performed in which BAL cultures were compared and correlated to chest radiographs. Patient characteristics, such as age, sex, burn size, depth of burn, and the presence of inhalation injury were evaluated. Over a period of 18 months, 58 thermally injured children were identified who underwent 101 BALs. The mean age was 6.5 ± 5 years, mean TBSA was 39 ± 27%, and inhalation injury was diagnosed in 20 patients (35%). Of 101 BALs, 48 were positive, and of the 101 chest radiographs, 20 demonstrated signs of pneumonia. Ten of those were associated with a positive BAL and 10 with a negative BAL. Thus, the positive predictive value of BAL was 21%, whereas the negative predictive value was 81%. Interestingly 80% of patients with tracheobronchitis from inhalation injury demonstrated a positive BAL. We conclude that in pediatric burn patients BAL correlates poorly with radiographic signs of pneumonia.","https://academic.oup.com/jbcr/article-pdf/24/6/382/23046208/00004630-200311000-00010.pdf",""

To demonstrate the ability of local microwave characterization, the surface resistance dependence of the metallic thin films on film thickness has been mapped.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article-pdf/83/5/1032/18580319/1032_1_online.pdf",""

OCL formation and activity is regulated by local factors produced in the bone microenvironment. We recently identified OCL inhibitory peptide-1 (OIP-1/hSca) as a novel inhibitor of OCL formation and bone resorption that is produced by OCLs. OIP-1 is a glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol (GPI)-linked membrane protein (16 kDa) related to the mouse Ly-6 family of hematopoietic proteins. OIP-1 mRNA is expressed in human OCL precursors, granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (GM-CFU), bone marrow cells, and osteoblast cells. We used cycle-dependent reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, which further demonstrated that interferon-γ (IFN-γ) strongly enhanced OIP-1/hSca mRNA expression in bone marrow cells and GM-CFU. Similarly, interleukin (IL)-1β also enhanced OIP-1 mRNA expression in GM-CFU. To determine the participation of OIP-1 in IFN-γ inhibition of OCL formation, we tested the capacity of a neutralizing antibody specific to OIP-1 c-peptide to inhibit IFN-γ's effects on OCL-like cell differentiation of mouse macrophages, RAW 264.7 cells. Anti-OIP-1 c-peptide specific antibody partially neutralized IFN-γ inhibition of OCL differentiation. Furthermore, OIP-1 inhibited phospho-c-Jun (p-c-Jun) kinase activity in RAW 264.7 cells. However, OIP-1/hSca did not affect NF-κB activation in these cells. Western blot analysis further demonstrated that OIP-1 significantly decreased TNF receptor associated factor 2 (TRAF-2) expression in RAW 264.7 cells. However, OIP-1 had no effect on TRAF-6 expression in these cells. These data show that IFN-γ enhances OIP-1/hSca expression in OCL precursors, GM-CFU, and that OIP-1 inhibits OCL formation through suppression of TRAF-2 and p-c-Jun kinase activity.","https://academic.oup.com/jbmr/article-pdf/18/3/458/56470669/5650180310.pdf",""

Apnea termination is accompanied by strong sympathoinhibition while arterial pressure remains elevated. Therefore, we hypothesized that the sensitivity of carotid baroreflex control of MSNA would decrease during apnea and return upon apnea termination. MSNA and heart rate responses to –60-Torr neck suction (NS) were evaluated during baseline and throughout apnea. Responses to +30-Torr neck pressure (NP) were evaluated during baseline and throughout 1 min postapnea. Apnea did not affect the sympathoinhibitory or bradycardic response to NS ( P > 0.05); however, whereas the cardiac response to NP was maintained postapnea, the sympathoexcitatory response was reduced for 50 s ( P < 0.05). These data demonstrate that the sensitivity of carotid baroreflex control of MSNA is not attenuated during apnea. We propose a transient rightward and upward resetting of the carotid baroreflex-MSNA function curve during apnea and that return of the function curve to, or more likely beyond, baseline (i.e., a downward and leftward shift) upon apnea termination may importantly contribute to the reduced sympathoexcitatory response to NP.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpheart.00139.2003",""

In the current research, we studied the morphology and motility of human fibroblasts embedded in floating collagen matrices at a cell density below that required for global matrix remodeling (i.e., contraction). Under these conditions, cells were observed to project and retract a dendritic network of extensions. These extensions contained microtubule cores with actin concentrated at the tips resembling growth cones. Platelet-derived growth factor promoted formation of the network; lysophosphatidic acid stimulated its retraction in a Rho and Rho kinase-dependent manner. The dendritic network also supported metabolic coupling between cells.

We find that as the ASW film thickness is increased above 150 BL, surface crystallization accelerates, rapidly at first and then more slowly until essentially size-independent kinetics are attained by 1050 BL. The potential origin of this thickness dependence is elucidated by a geometrical model of surface crystallization that we formulated using mechanistic information deduced from available experimental data. This simple mean-field model predicts that as film thickness is reduced below some critical value, the number of grains contributing to surface transformation progressively decreases, forcing each grain to convert a larger surface area and thus slowing crystallization. Good agreement between experimental data and the theory is realized using only two thickness-independent kinetic parameters (per temperature), suggesting that the model describes the basic physics of crystallization in these ASW films.

In the peripheral nervous system, nerves can regenerate on their own if injuries are small. Larger injuries must be surgically treated, typically with nerve grafts harvested from elsewhere in the body. Spinal cord injury is more complicated, as there are factors in the body that inhibit repair. Unfortunately, a solution to completely repair spinal cord injury has not been found. Thus, bioengineering strategies for the peripheral nervous system are focused on alternatives to the nerve graft, whereas efforts for spinal cord injury are focused on creating a permissive environment for regeneration. Fortunately, recent advances in neuroscience, cell culture, genetic techniques, and biomaterials provide optimism for new treatments for nerve injuries. This article reviews the nervous system physiology, the factors that are critical for nerve repair, and the current approaches that are being explored to aid peripheral nerve regeneration and spinal cord repair.","https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.bioeng.5.011303.120731",""

Erythromycin, a motilin receptor agonist, triggers migrating motor complexes and accelerates gastric emptying in adults with feeding intolerance. Few studies have assessed the efficacy of this drug in preterm infants with established feeding intolerance. This study was designed to assess the efficacy of erythromycin in feeding‐intolerant infants, as measured by gastric emptying, maturation of gastrointestinal motor patterns, and time to achieve full enteral feedings. Methods: Subjects were 27 preterm infants who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit and who did not achieve full enteral feeding volumes (150 mL/kg/day) within 8 days of the initiation of feedings. In a controlled, randomized, double‐blinded clinical trial, infants received intragastric erythromycin or placebo for 8 days without crossover. At study entry, the authors recorded motor activity in the antrum and the duodenum during fasting, in response to intragastric erythromycin (1.5 mg/kg) or placebo, and in response to feeding. Gastric emptying at 20 minutes and transit time from duodenum to anus were determined. Each infant then received erythromycin or placebo for 8 days, and feeding characteristics were prospectively tracked. Results: Gastric emptying and characteristics of antroduodenal motor contractions were similar in the two groups, as were the transit times from duodenum to anus. Feeding outcomes were comparable in the two groups. Conclusion: Intragastric erythromycin does not improve feeding tolerance in preterm infants with established feeding intolerance because it fails to improve gastrointestinal function in the short or long term.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/j.1536-4801.2003.tb11995.x",""

However, there is little information available about the instructional effectiveness of lecture-slide presentations in changing knowledge vs. beliefs of such professionals. Design:: A modified Solomon four-group experimental design was used to assess the instructional effectiveness (knowledge gain vs. belief changes) of threehour addiction science workshops presented to health-care professionals by neurobiologically-trained academic researchers. Effectiveness of the workshops was assessed by a 28-item questionnaire on participant versus control group knowledge/beliefs on addiction. Six-month follow-up questionnaires measured “retention” of knowledge and belief changes. Results:: The workshop participants showed significant knowledge gain and belief changes, whereas the two control groups showed no change in knowledge or beliefs. After six months, knowledge gains decreased, but were still higher than pre-test scores. In contrast, belief changes on three subscales persisted over six months in 40 to 52 percent of the subjects. Conclusions: These results illustrate a successful continuing education model by which academic researchers who are skilled teachers present a three-hour lecture-slide workshop with extensive question-and-answer sessions on addictions. We conclude that motivated health-care professionals can experience important knowledge gains and belief changes by participating in such workshops. In contrast to the transient retention of knowledge, belief changes persisted surprisingly well for at least six months in about half the subjects. These results suggest that long-term changes in the professional orientation of these health-care workers are possible.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2190/4WWF-3TGV-VXR5-PU45",""

SV40 small tumor antigen (small t) interacts with endogenous serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and is required for the transforming activity of SV40 in epithelial cells of the lung and kidney. Here, we show that expression of SV40 small t in epithelial MDCK cells induces acute morphological changes and multilayering. Significantly, it also causes severe defects in the biogenesis and barrier properties of tight junctions (TJs) but does not prevent formation of adherens junctions. Small t-induced TJ defects are associated with a loss of PP2A from areas of cell-cell contact; altered distribution and reduced amounts of the TJ proteins ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1; and marked disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Small t-mediated F-actin rearrangements encompass increased Rac-induced membrane ruffling and lamellipodia, Cdc42-initiated filopodia, and loss of Rho-dependent stress fibers. Indeed, these F-actin changes coincide with elevated levels of Rac1 and Cdc42 and decreased amounts of RhoA in small t-expressing cells. Notably, these cellular effects of small t are dependent on its interaction with endogenous PP2A. Thus, our findings provide the first evidence that, in polarized epithelial cells, expression of small t alone is sufficient to induce deregulation of Rho GTPases, F-actin, and intercellular adhesion, through interaction with endogenous PP2A. Because defects in the actin cytoskeleton and TJ disruption have been linked to loss of cell polarity and tumor invasiveness, their deregulation by PP2A and small t likely contributes to the role of SV40 in epithelial cell transformation.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.77.5.2807-2818.2003",""

Where host and parasite overlap geographically, selection may be reciprocal constituting a coevolutionary hot spot. Host evolution, however, may be driven primarily by selection imposed by alternative biotic or abiotic factors that occur outside such hot spots. To evaluate the importance of coevolutionary hot spots for host and parasite evolution, we analyse a spatially explicit genetic model for a host that overlaps with a parasite in only part of its geographical range. Our results show that there is a critical amount of overlap beyond which reciprocal selection leads to a coevolutionary response in the host. This critical amount of overlap depends upon the explicit spatial configuration of hot spots. When the amount of overlap exceeds this first critical level, host–parasite coevolution commonly generates stable allele frequency clines rather than oscillations. It is within this region that one of the primary predictions of the geographic mosaic theory is realized, and local maladaptation is prevalent in both species. Past a further threshold of overlap between the species oscillations do evolve, but allele frequencies in both species are spatially synchronous and local maladaptation is absent in both species. A consequence of such transitions between coevolutionary dynamics is that parasite adaptation is inversely proportional to the fraction of its host's range that it occupies. Hence, as the geographical range of a parasite increases, it becomes increasingly maladapted to the host. This suggests a novel mechanism through which the geographical range of parasites may be limited.","https://academic.oup.com/jeb/article-pdf/16/6/1337/54440043/j.1420-9101.2003.00609.x.pdf",""

Any approach mechanism, which brings a tip close to the sample, suffers from dry frictional force, which makes positioning of the tip over the sample rather difficult. In this unique design, we have reduced the friction to a minimum by oscillating the normal force on the sliding sapphire surfaces. This technique allows us to precisely position the tip over the sample after traveling a distance greater than 100 μm while maintaining a compact STM design. This technique of reducing friction is also very useful in an automatic inertial approach mechanism (or “stick–slip” motor), where the motion often becomes clamped due to excessive friction. We believe that this technique will be extremely useful for applications where high precision positioning is required.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/rsi/article-pdf/74/10/4384/19022130/4384_1_online.pdf",""

Overexpressing antisense Arabidopsis thaliana HD1 (AtHD1) encoding a putative major histone deacetylase induces pleiotropic effects on plant growth and development. It is unclear whether the developmental abnormalities are caused by a defective AtHD1 or related homologs and are heritable in selfing progeny. We isolated a stable antisense AtHD1 (CASH) transgenic line and a T-DNA insertion line in exon 2 of AtHD1, resulting in a null allele (athd1-t1). Both athd1-t1 and CASH lines display increased levels of histone acetylation and similar developmental abnormalities, which are heritable in the presence of antisense AtHD1 or in the progeny of homozygous (athd1-t1/athd1-t1) plants. Furthermore, when the athd1-t1/athd1-t1 plants are crossed to wild-type plants, the pleiotropic developmental abnormalities are immediately restored in the F1 hybrids, which correlates with AtHD1 expression and reduction of histone H4 Lys12 acetylation. Unlike the situation with the stable code of DNA and histone methylation, developmental changes induced by histone deacetylase defects are immediately reversible, probably through the restoration of a reversible histone acetylation code needed for the normal control of gene regulation and development.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/165/1/399/42052331/genetics0399.pdf",""

Geometry optimizations of the various species were performed at the Becke three parameter Lee–Yang–Parr (B3LYP)/6-31G(d,p) level, and single-point energies were computed using second-order Møller–Plesset and coupled-cluster theory with single and double excitations including perturbative corrections for the triple excitations. The activation and reaction energies of C–C bond scission of the alkoxy radicals are in the ranges of 12–25 and −3–22 kcal mol−1, respectively.

Domains form in the hard layer at this remanence state. The angular dependence of the coercive field does not indicate magnetization reversal by domain wall motion. The bottom soft CoNi layer exchange couples to each domain in the hard layer at the interface. This causes the exchange bias field to become zero on the average. If the trilayer is cooled at its full remanence state, the formation of Hb anisotropy is observed in the angular dependence of coercivity.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/93/10/7157/18931389/7157_1_online.pdf",""

Model I presumes a two-step, reverse Lindemann mechanism, where the intermediate energized complex, He2+*, is interpreted as the rotational resonance states of He2+. The energy and width of these resonances are determined via “exact” quantum calculation using highly accurate potential-energy curves. Model II uses an alternate quantum rate expression as the thermal average of the cumulative recombination probability, N(E). This microcanonical quantity is computed approximately, over the He2+ space only, with the third-body interaction modeled using a special type of absorbing potential. Because Model II implicitly incorporates both the two-step reverse Lindemann mechanism, and a one-step, reverse collision induced dissociation mechanism, the relative importance of the two formation mechanisms can be estimated by a comparison of the Model I and Model II results. For T&lt;300 K, the reaction is found to be dominated by the two-step mechanism, and a formation rate in good agreement with the available experimental results is obtained with essentially no adjustable parameters in the theory. Interestingly, a nonmonotonic He2+ formation rate is observed, with a maximum identified near 25 K. This maximum is associated with just two reaction intermediate resonance states, the lowest energy states that can contribute significantly to the formation kinetics.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/119/20/10678/19009349/10678_1_online.pdf",""

However, eye-hand dissociation, a two-dimensional field-of-view and fixed instrumentation with limited degrees of freedom contribute to a steep learning curve and demanding dexterity requirements for many laparoscopic procedures. One of the main limitations of laparoscopy is the fixed working envelope surrounding each trocar, often necessitating placement of multiple ports to accomodate changes in position of the instruments or laparoscope to improve visibility and efficiency. The placement of additional working ports contributes to post-operative pain and carries a small risk of bleeding or adjacent organ damage. In order to provide for greater flexibility of endoscopic viewing and instrument usage and to further reduce morbidity, a novel adjunct laparoscopic system has been developed consisting of a platform capable of supporting various laparoscopic tools which is secured magnetically to the abdominal wall and subsequently positioned within the abdominal cavity through surgeon-controlled, external magnetic couples on the patient’s abdomen. Using this technique, instruments such as miniature endoscopic cameras used to augment the surgical field of view and surgical retractors have been successfully evaluated in a dry laboratory as well as in porcine models, with several others currently under investigation. This document elaborates on the theoretical and empirical process which has led to anchoring designs optimized for size, strength and surgical compatibility, as well as the benefits, limitations and prospects for the use of incisionless, magnetically-coupled tooling in laparoscopic surgery.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2003-42404/2597544/157_1.pdf",""

In the other two experiments, decadal‐varying backgrounds with different amplitudes were introduced into the ICM in addition to the stochastic forcing. By comparing the low‐frequency variations of ENSO predictability in these experiments, it is found that only when the amplitude of the decadal‐varying background is unrealistically strong, the effect of decadal‐varying background on ENSO predictability is comparable to or larger than the stochastically induced low‐frequency ENSO variation.

In humans data are limited to short-term (≤48 h) lipid infusion studies and have led to conflicting results. We examined insulin secretion and action during a 4-day lipid infusion in healthy normal glucose tolerant subjects with (FH+ group, n = 13) and without (control subjects, n = 8) a family history of type 2 diabetes. Volunteers were admitted twice to the clinical research center and received, in random order, a lipid or saline infusion. On days 1 and 2, insulin and C-peptide concentration were measured as part of a metabolic profile after standardized mixed meals. Insulin secretion in response to glucose was assessed with a +125 mg/dl hyperglycemic clamp on day 3. On day 4, glucose turnover was measured with a euglycemic insulin clamp with [3-3H]glucose. Day-long plasma FFA concentrations with lipid infusion were increased within the physiological range, to levels seen in type 2 diabetes (∼500–800 μmol/l). Lipid infusion had strikingly opposite effects on insulin secretion in the two groups. After mixed meals, day-long plasma C-peptide levels increased with lipid infusion in control subjects but decreased in the FH+ group (+28 vs. −30%, respectively, P &lt; 0.01). During the hyperglycemic clamp, lipid infusion enhanced the insulin secretion rate (ISR) in control subjects but decreased it in the FH+ group (first phase: +75 vs. −60%, P &lt; 0.001; second phase: +25 vs. −35%, P &lt; 0.04). When the ISR was adjusted for insulin resistance (ISRRd = ISR ÷ [1/Rd], where Rd is the rate of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal), the inadequate β-cell response in the FH+ group was even more evident. Although ISRRd was not different between the two groups before lipid infusion, in the FH+ group, lipid infusion reduced first- and second-phase ISRRd to 25 and 42% of that in control subjects, respectively (both P &lt; 0.001 vs. control subjects). Lipid infusion in the FH+ group (but not in control subjects) also caused severe hepatic insulin resistance with an increase in basal endogenous glucose production (EGP), despite an elevation in fasting insulin levels, and impaired suppression of EGP to insulin. In summary, in individuals who are genetically predisposed to type 2 diabetes, a sustained physiological increase in plasma FFA impairs insulin secretion in response to mixed meals and to intravenous glucose, suggesting that in subjects at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes, β-cell lipotoxicity may play an important role in the progression from normal glucose tolerance to overt hyperglycemia.","https://journals.org/diabetes/diabetes/article-pdf/52/10/2461/370620/db1003002461.pdf",""

However, at relatively moderate flow rates, multiple advance detector systems tend to extend the green phase to its maximum allowable duration (i.e., max-out). At max-out, drivers on the intersection approach may be faced with the decision to proceed or stop. This creates the safety problem the system was intended to prevent. Also, extending phases to their maximums increases delays to other movements. A new approach to high-speed intersection control is outlined—a dynamic dilemma zone allocation system that uses measured vehicle speeds with a control algorithm to decide when to end the signal phases. The new system was evaluated by simulation and field installation. In both instances, the new system indicated it could improve safety and maintain efficient operations at high-speed intersections.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/1856-23",""

At early stages of glomerulogenesis, RECA-1- and Thy1.1-positive cells were detected in the metanephric blastema at 14 days post conception (dpc) embryos and 15 dpc, respectively, with Thy1.1 expression in cells surrounding the ureteric bud.

Double staining for BrdU, a marker of proliferation, and for RECA-1 or BrdU and Thy1.1 also localize in the cleft of S-shaped bodies and in glomerular capillary loops at later stages of development. PDGFRβ co-localizes in cells expressing endothelial or mesangial markers. The data suggest that endothelial and mesangial cell precursors share common markers during the course of glomerulogenesis and that full differentiation of these cells occurs at late stages of glomerular maturation. Thy1.1- and RECA-1-positive cells may be derived from the metanephric blastemal cells at early stages of kidney development.

If the sample is cooled from room temperature at the remanence state corresponding to the hard layer coercive field, the exchange bias becomes zero. Domains form in the hard layer at this remanence state. The angular dependence of the coercive field does not indicate magnetization reversal by domain wall motion. The bottom soft CoNi layer exchange couples to each domain in the hard layer at the interface. This causes the exchange bias field to become zero on the average.

Model I presumes a two-step, reverse Lindemann mechanism, where the intermediate energized complex, He2+*, is interpreted as the rotational resonance states of He2+. The energy and width of these resonances are determined via “exact” quantum calculation using highly accurate potential-energy curves. Model II uses an alternate quantum rate expression as the thermal average of the cumulative recombination probability, N(E). This microcanonical quantity is computed approximately, over the He2+ space only, with the third-body interaction modeled using a special type of absorbing potential. Because Model II implicitly incorporates both the two-step reverse Lindemann mechanism, and a one-step, reverse collision induced dissociation mechanism, the relative importance of the two formation mechanisms can be estimated by a comparison of the Model I and Model II results. For T&lt;300 K, the reaction is found to be dominated by the two-step mechanism, and a formation rate in good agreement with the available experimental results is obtained with essentially no adjustable parameters in the theory. Interestingly, a nonmonotonic He2+ formation rate is observed, with a maximum identified near 25 K. This maximum is associated with just two reaction intermediate resonance states, the lowest energy states that can contribute significantly to the formation kinetics.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/119/20/10678/19009349/10678_1_online.pdf",""

We propose a novel imaging technique in which brightfield images of diaminobenzidene (DAB)-labeled antigens are converted to normalized blue images, allowing automated identification of positively stained tissue. A statistical analysis compared our method with seven previously published imaging techniques by measuring each one's agreement with manual analysis by two observers. Eighteen DAB-stained images showing a range of protein levels were used. Accuracy was assessed by calculating the percentage of pixels misclassified using each technique compared with a manual standard. Bland-Altman analysis was then used to show the extent to which misclassification affected staining quantification. Many of the techniques were inconsistent in classifying DAB staining due to background interference, but our method was statistically the most accurate and consistent across all staining levels.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/002215540305100503",""

Purposes were (a) to identify how decisions were made to change living arrangements, (b) to describe the process of adaptation to relocation as it evolved over time including challenges and strategies used to address them, and (c) to identify indicators of effective adaptation. A phenomenological approach based on interviews, observations, and comparative analysis was used to capture the insiders' views of these elders. An account of each individual adaptive process was developed. Comparison across cases led to two major themes—sense of place and sense of self—which are proposed as indicators of effective adaptation.

As rotational speeds and rotor tip speeds increase, these rotors must operate in low air pressure environments to minimize windage losses and thermal effects of being at high speed for long durations. Accurately predicting this windage loss for a specific geometry and operating conditions is very important for a proper design. It is also very important to know the relative heat distribution that is seen by the rotor and stator from this windage loss. Analysis tools to date do not have a coupled link that calculates windage loss and a resultant thermal distribution to the rotor and stator surfaces. This paper presents the design and fabrication of a test setup to measure the total windage loss and temperature distribution from a high-speed composite rotor in a stator structure. Rotor speeds up to 40,000 rpm and rotor tip speeds up to 900 m/s with pressure ranges from 0.1 torr to 10 torr were operating parameters during the testing. The paper will also present experimental data obtained during the testing. Experimental data obtained during the testing will be used to evaluate new analysis methods for predicting the windage loss and thermal distribution in new high-speed rotor applications.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/HT/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/HT2003-47117/4551278/7_1.pdf",""

The objective of this research is to examine unstable flow behavior over a three-dimensional topographic model, representative of mesa terrain that is common in West Texas. The goal is to develop an understanding of how unstable atmospheric conditions caused by surface heating affect boundary layer flow patterns in the natural environment. This objective was accomplished by experimentally monitoring transient thermal behavior of narrow band liquid crystals over a scaled model. Photographic data was collected as the heated model was subjected to a cooler flow field. The transient isotherms result from cooling as the model is exposed to flow in an atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnel. Results suggest that flow patterns associated with unstable conditions can be explained by increased wind speeds on the lee side of a mesa followed by vigorous mixing causing increased cooling rates around the mesa sides. The results could be used to improve the accuracy of numerical atmospheric flow models, assess the feasibility of developing wind turbine sites, and increase the knowledge-base in order to advance wind energy forecasting techniques.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/WIND/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/WIND2003-1187/4530507/410_1.pdf",""

Herpes zoster is often very painful and may result in months or years of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Over the past two decades, the treatment of these conditions has been transformed by guanosine nucleoside antivirals such as valacyclovir (Valtrex®), a highly bioavailable prodrug of acyclovir (Zovirax®), and famciclovir (Famvir®), a highly bioavailable prodrug of penciclovir (Denavir®). Objective:: We describe the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and clinical efficacy of valacyclovir for the treatment of herpes simplex, herpes zoster, and other viral infections. Valacyclovir is also compared with acyclovir and famciclovir. Methods:: All published literature containing the word “valacyclovir” was reviewed and summarized. Results:: Valacyclovir is the only oral antiviral agent approved for therapy of herpes labialis, the only antiviral drug approved for a 3-day course in the episodic treatment of recurrent genital herpes, as well as the only antiviral drug approved for once daily dosing for suppressive therapy. In herpes zoster, valacyclovir is more effective than acyclovir and equally effective as famciclovir at hastening the healing of zoster-associated pain and PHN. Conclusion:: Valacyclovir is safe and effective in the therapy of patients with herpes simplex and herpes zoster and may be useful in other viral infections.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/120347540300700502",""

The expression of >400 genes changed at least threefold in response to TCA cycle dysfunction. Many genes displayed a common response to TCA cycle dysfunction indicative of a shift away from oxidative metabolism. Another set of genes displayed a pairwise, alternating pattern of expression in response to contiguous TCA cycle enzyme defects: expression was elevated in aconitase and isocitrate dehydrogenase mutants, diminished in α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and succinyl-CoA ligase mutants, elevated again in succinate dehydrogenase and fumarase mutants, and diminished again in malate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase mutants. This pattern correlated with previously defined TCA cycle growth–enhancing mutations and suggested a novel metabolic signaling pathway monitoring TCA cycle function. Expression of hypoxic/anaerobic genes was elevated in α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase mutants, whereas expression of oxidative genes was diminished, consistent with a heme signaling defect caused by inadequate levels of the heme precursor, succinyl-CoA. These studies have revealed extensive responses to changes in TCA cycle function and have uncovered new and unexpected metabolic networks that are wired into the TCA cycle.","",""

Growth is effectively isolated from nucleation by dividing a phase transition into two isothermal stages: prenucleation, where product crystallites nucleate and grow concurrently, and growth, in which transformation is completed essentially entirely by the expansion of these “seed” grains. Using the model, the temperature dependence of growth may be extracted from converted fraction versus time data for specimens that are appreciably larger than the mean crystal grain size. Similarly, the growth velocity can be ascertained from thin films that exhibit thickness-dependent transition kinetics owing to geometric constraints imposed by the specimen size. The combination of grain growth kinetics and information derived from the transformation of unseeded materials then allows the subsequent calculation of the temperature dependence and absolute rates of nucleation. A preliminary assessment of this method (for the crystallization of amorphous solid water) indicates that the model captures the basic physics of “seeded” transformations and that the technique appears to be a viable method of quantifying simultaneous nucleation and growth in some solids.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/119/23/12510/19267972/12510_1_online.pdf",""

Device concepts and their applications such as noncontact bearings, flywheels, and momentum wheels are discussed, following an exposition of the principles behind these devices. The basic magneto–mechanical phenomenon responsible for levitation in these devices is a result of flux pinning inherent in the interaction between a magnet and a type II superconductor, described and explained in this article by comparison with behavior expected of a perfect conductor or a nearly perfect conductor. The perfect conductor model is used to illustrate why there is a difference between the forces observed when the superconductor is cooled after or before the magnet is brought into position. The same model also establishes the principle that a resisting force or torque arises only in response to those motions of the magnet that changes the magnet field at the superconductor. A corollary of the converse, that no drag torque appears when an axisymmetric magnet levitated above a superconductor rotates, is the guiding concept in the design of superconductor magnet levitation bearings, which is the common component in a majority of levitation devices. The perfect conductor model is extended to a nearly perfect conductor to provide a qualitative understanding of the dissipative aspects such as creep and hysteresis in the interaction between magnets and superconductors. What all these entail in terms of forces, torques, and power loss is expounded further in the context of generic cases of a cylindrical permanent magnet levitated above a superconductor and a superconductor rotating in a transverse magnetic field. Then we proceed to compare the pros and cons of levitation bearings based on the first arrangement with conventional mechanical bearings and active magnetic bearings, and discuss how the weak points of the levitation bearing may be partially overcome. In the latter half, we examine designs of devices using superconductor magnet levitation, focusing more on issues specific to the application. We note that applications of superconductor magnet levitation devices tend to be most attractive in situations where energy conservation is critical. The most advanced in development are flywheel kinetic energy storage systems incorporating superconductor magnet bearings. Variations in the designs to enhance the performance in some specific regards are examined case by case. Next we present a reaction wheel for attitude control on small satellites, similar in overall design to the flywheel kinetic energy storage systems, but with subtle differences in details of emphasis, due to the difference in purpose and environment. Finally, we take a brief look at the case of vibration isolation devices as an example of a rectilinear modification of the more familiar rotational bearing applications.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/rsi/article-pdf/74/12/4989/19142755/4989_1_online.pdf",""

The survey was used to evaluate drivers’ ability to describe the pavement marking color code, drivers’ reliance on pavement marking patterns when interpreting marking messages, and drivers’ reliance on pavement marking color when interpreting marking messages. Researchers surveyed 851 drivers in 5 states, with respondents representing 47 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The survey results indicate that drivers tend to use signs and other traffic as the primary cue to determine whether a road is one-way or two-way. A substantial proportion of respondents had an understanding of the use of marking color to differentiate between one-way and two-way roads, but this knowledge is not the primary tool that drivers use to distinguish the direction of travel on a road. Approximately 75% of the drivers surveyed understood the basic concept that a single broken yellow line separates opposing traffic on a two-lane road. The presence of a solid line (either double solid or solid and broken) in the centerline increases comprehension of directional flow to approximately 85%; more than 90% of the drivers surveyed understood that a solid line (either double solid or solid and broken) prohibits passing. Almost 95% of drivers indicated that passing is permitted with a broken line.

The benign form of EV presents a singular type of lesions comprised of flat warts widely disseminated. The malignant form of EV is highly polymorphic and presents as malignant skin tumors, predominantly basal and squamous cell carcinomas, on sun‐exposed sites. The seborrheic keratosis‐like (SK) lesions in patients of EV have been reported to be associated with the malignant phenotype. In this work, we documented the behavior of SK‐like lesions in nine patients with EV, through clinical observations as well as histological and immunohistochemical findings.

Counting the number of mutant individuals provides information for a direct estimate of mutation rate. However, mutant individuals in the same family can share the same mutations due to premeiotic mutation events, so that the number of mutant individuals can be significantly larger than the number of mutation events observed. Since mutation rate is more closely related to the number of mutation events, whether one should count only independent mutation events or the number of mutants remains controversial. We show in this article that counting mutant individuals is a correct approach for estimating mutation rate, while counting only mutation events will result in underestimation. We also derived the variance of the mutation-rate estimate, which allows us to examine a number of important issues about the design of such experiments. The general strategy of such an experiment should be to sample as many families as possible and not to sample much more offspring per family than the reciprocal of the pairwise correlation coefficient within each family. To obtain a reasonably accurate estimate of mutation rate, the number of sampled families needs to be in the same or higher order of magnitude as the reciprocal of the mutation rate.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/164/2/797/42052225/genetics0797.pdf",""

Although stimulation with 0.05 mm dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP) did not increase StAR protein or progesterone in MA-10 mouse Leydig cells, the addition of 1 μm of the COX inhibitor indomethacin increased StAR protein expression and progesterone production by 5.7-fold and 34.3-fold, respectively. In the presence of indomethacin, the level of Bt2cAMP required for maximal steroidogenesis was reduced from 1.0 mm to 0.25 mm. Similar results were obtained in studies on StAR promoter activity and in Northern blot analyses of StAR mRNA expression, suggesting that inhibition of COX activity enhanced StAR gene transcription. COX2 (an inducible isoform of COX) was constitutively detected in MA-10 cells. Although SC560, a selective COX1 inhibitor, did not affect steroidogenesis, the COX2 inhibitor NS398 significantly enhanced Bt2cAMP-stimulated StAR protein expression and steroid production. Overexpression of the COX2 gene in COS-1 cells significantly inhibited StAR promoter activity.

However, the molecular mechanisms involved in regulating CSF-1 gene expression are unclear. To identify regulatory regions that control normal CSF-1 gene expression, a −774/+183-bp fragment of the murine CSF-1 promoter was analyzed in vitro and in vivo. Transcriptional activity was high in cultured osteoblasts that express CSF-1 mRNA compared to ARH-77 B cells that lack CSF-1 gene expression. Transient transfection of osteoblasts with promoter deletion constructs showed that the −774-bp fragment conferred the highest transcriptional activity and contained activator and repressor sequences. To assess the ability of the CSF-1 promoter to confer normal tissue expression of CSF-1, transgenic mice containing the −774/+183-bp region driving the E. coli β-galactosidase (lacZ) reporter gene were generated. β-Gal analysis of whole tissue extracts showed transgene expression in all tissues tested except liver and kidney. At the cellular level, the pattern of β-gal expression in the spleen, thymus, bone, lung, and testes of adult transgenic mice mimicked normal endogenous CSF-1 mRNA expression in non-transgenic littermates detected by in situ hybridization. This region also directed appropriate transgene expression to sites in other tissues known to synthesize CSF-1, with the exception of the liver and kidney. These findings indicate that the −774-bp fragment contains cis-acting elements sufficient to direct CSF-1 gene expression in many tissues. CSF-1 promoter/lacZ mice may be useful for studying the transcriptional mechanisms involved in regulating CSF-1 gene expression in tissues throughout development.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/002215540305100709",""

Detailed structure appearing in the spectra, associated with individual multiplet states, LJ2S+1, of Er3+(4f11) and Yb3+(4f13) is interpreted using a ligand-field coordination sphere model to characterize the microscopic environment surrounding the rare earth ions in multiple sites. Inhomogeneous broadening of the spectra is likely due to different configurations of PO4 tetrahedra clustered about a caged rare earth ion in the amorphous host. Similarity between the Er3+ spectrum in the glass and in the spectrum of single-crystal LiErP4O12, where Er3+ occupies sites of C2 symmetry, suggests that an averaged site symmetry of C2 is a reasonable approximation for Er3+ and Yb3+ ions in the phosphate glass. Calculated splitting of multiplet states by the ligand-field cluster model are compared with energy levels derived from the observed absorption peaks and well-defined shoulders. Inhomogeneous broadening of the spectra limit the precision in establishing the energy of the multiplet splittings, but the analysis is useful for modeling studies of the Er:Yb:phosphate glass as an eye-safe laser (1.53 μm). The splitting of the Yb3+(4f13)2FJ states is determined using parameters obtained from the Er3+ set by means of the three-parameter theory.

In rodents, leptin causes divergent effects on LH and insulin release that are dose dependent. To test the hypothesis that leptin effects on LH and insulin secretion in fasted cows are dose related, we examined the effects of various doses of recombinant ovine leptin (oleptin) in mature cows. Twenty ovariectomized beef cows, each bearing an estradiol implant to maintain basal estradiol concentrations, were used. All cows were fasted for 60 hr with free access to water and were assigned randomly to one of four groups (n = 5/group): 1) saline control; 2) leptin, 0.2 μg/kg; 3) leptin, 2.0 μg/kg; and 4) leptin, 20 μg/kg body wt. Blood samples were collected at 10-min intervals for 6 hr on Days 0 and 2, with saline or oleptin injected intravenously immediately after the first intensive sample on Day 2 (54 hr). Leptin caused a dose-related increase (P < 0.001) in mean concentrations of circulating LH. Stimulation of LH release by leptin was significant at the lowest (141% of control) and middle (122% of control) doses used, but no increase was observed for the highest dose. Increased mean concentrations of LH appeared to result from an augmentation of basal secretion, as pulse characteristics were not affected. After 54 hr of fasting, plasma insulin concentrations were lowered (P < 0.01) in all treatment groups compared to Day 0. After leptin injections, plasma insulin concentrations increased (P < 0.01) and reached highest concentrations during the first hour of sampling. However, this increase was sustained for several hours only in the intermediate (2.0 μg/kg) dose group. Collectively, our results show that leptin has potent positive effects on both LH and insulin secretion in fasted cows, but the anterior pituitary and endocrine pancreas appear to become downregulated in the presence of excess ligand.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/153537020322800312",""

Sequencing studies have implicated positively charged amino acids on the surface of the E2 envelope glycoprotein in the acquisition of equine virulence and viremia potential, suggesting that changes in binding to cell surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) may mediate VEE emergence. Therefore, we evaluated the binding of natural enzootic and epizootic VEEV isolates to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing normal, high levels of GAGs as well as to mutant CHO cells lacking GAG expression. Binding to GAGs was not consistently associated with the epizootic phenotype, and cell culture passages resulted in increased GAG binding. The low levels of GAG binding exhibited by some low-passage, equine-virulent subtype IC VEEV strains indicate that the positive-charge E2 mutations implicated in VEE subtype IC emergence are not artifacts of laboratory passage and suggest that GAG binding does not play a major role in mediating VEE emergence. The increased GAG binding exhibited by VEEV strain CPA201 from the 1993 Mexican epizootic, when compared to that of closely related enzootic subtype IE strains, was shown to result from a Glu-to-Lys mutation at position 117 of the E2 envelope glycoprotein.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.77.2.1204-1210.2003",""

Our method, which employs a semiclassical description of both the nuclear motion and the radiation field, is described in the text. After excitation of electrons from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) by a femtosecond-scale laser pulse, two principal avoided crossings are observed between the HOMO and LUMO levels, each of which leads to substantial depopulation of the LUMO. Based on our results and those of other groups, we propose that the first such HOMO–LUMO coupling can lead to the formation of 4a,4b-dihydrophenanthrene (DHP). The second coupling, on the other hand, leads to the formation of trans-stilbene. It is found that pyramidalization of the two carbon atoms of the vinyl group is involved significantly in both couplings, and that rotation of the two phenyl rings, together with their interaction, plays an important role in the first coupling. The occurrence along the same trajectory of two couplings, one leading to DHP and the other leading to isomerization, is a significant observation, and one which indicates that further theoretical and experimental investigations would be of considerable interest.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/119/20/10658/19009026/10658_1_online.pdf",""

Hepatic fat content (magnetic resonance spectroscopy) and SGU (oral glucose load- insulin clamp technique) were quantitated before and after pioglitazone (45 mg/day) therapy for 16 weeks. Subjects received a 7-h euglycemic insulin (100 mU · m−2 · min−1) clamp, and a 75-g oral glucose load was ingested 3 h after starting the insulin clamp. Following glucose ingestion, the steady-state glucose infusion rate during the insulin clamp was decreased appropriately to maintain euglycemia. SGU was calculated by subtracting the integrated decrease in glucose infusion rate during the 4 h after glucose ingestion from the ingested glucose load. 3-[3H]glucose was infused during the initial 3 h of the insulin clamp to determine rates of EGP and glucose disappearance (Rd). Pioglitazone reduced fasting plasma glucose (10.0 ± 0.7 to 7.5 ± 0.6 mmol/l, P &lt; 0.001) and HbA1c (7.8 ± 0.4 to 6.7 ± 0.3%, P &lt; 0.001) despite increased body weight (83 ± 3 to 86 ± 3 kg, P &lt; 0.001).

The deterministic approach relies on imposing parameter smoothness constraints using spatial derivatives to ensure large-scale changes consistent with the low resolution of the production data. The Bayesian approach is based on prior estimates of model statistics such as parameter covariance and data errors and attempts to generate posterior models consistent with the static and dynamic data. Both approaches have been successful for field-scale applications although the computational costs associated with the two methods can vary widely. This is particularly the case for the Bayesian approach that utilizes a prior covariance matrix that can be large and full. To date, no systematic study has been carried out to examine the scaling properties and relative merits of the methods.","https://onepetro.org/spersc/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/79666-MS/2909446/spe-79666-ms.pdf",""

These include watercut, tracer concentration and pressure history at the wells. It is well-known that such amplitude matching results in a highly non-linear inverse problem and difficulties in convergence, often leading to an inadequate history match. The nonlinearity can also aggravate the problem of non-uniqueness and instability of the solution. Recently, production data integration via ‘travel-time matching’ has shown great promise for practical field applications. In this approach the observed data and model predictions are lined up at some reference time such as the breakthrough or ‘first arrival’ time. Further extensions have included amplitude information via a ‘generalized travel-time’ inversion. Although the travel-time inversion has been shown to be more robust compared to amplitude matching, no systematic study has been done to examine the relative merits of the methods in terms of the nonlinearities and convergence properties, particularly for field-scale applications.","https://onepetro.org/SPEATCE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/84570-MS/2899228/spe-84570-ms.pdf",""

The field has been under peripheral water injection with 16 injectors and 70 producers. There is also a strong aquifer influx into the field. A total of 30 years of production history with detailed rate, infill well and reperforation schedule were incorporated via multiple pressure updates during streamline simulation. Also, gravity and compressibility effects were included to account for water slumping and aquifer support. To our knowledge, this is the first and the largest such application of production data integration to geologic models accounting for realistic field conditions. We have developed novel techniques to analytically compute the sensitivities of the production response in the presence of gravity and changing field conditions. This makes our method extremely computationally efficient. For the field application, the production data integration is carried out in less than 6 hours in a PC.","https://onepetro.org/SPEATCE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/84079-MS/2893447/spe-84079-ms.pdf",""

We found that receptors in the pit organ exhibited a unique broad response to a wide range of electromagnetic radiation ranging from the near UV to the infrared. The spectral tuning of these receptors parallels closely the absorption spectra of water and oxyhemoglobin, the predominant chromophore in tissue.

This concept, already used in our previous work for two-phase systems and symmetric voltammogram spike shapes, is here substantially generalized to systems with multiple-phase coexistence and asymmetric spike shapes, using the rigorous statistical mechanical techniques of Borgs and Kotecký. Rather than mere numerical plots, we extract explicit functions that accurately describe the spike shapes. For the sake of clarity, we present our analysis and apply our results to fit the voltammogram of the UPD of Cu on Au(111) in sulfuric acid medium. This voltammogram shows two distinct spikes with a broad foot region near the spike at higher potentials. As was done in earlier treatments, we explain each of the two spikes as a result of a first-order transition. Here, though, the spikes are obtained as envelopes of closely spaced spikes resulting from crystals of various sizes. In contrast to earlier studies, however, we also explain the foot region in the same way. The foot’s shape, despite its large width and small height, can be equally well obtained as an envelope of shifted crystal spikes that are broader and smaller than those giving rise to the two distinct spikes.

Through the years the designs have changed, but engineers continue to see cable barrier as an inexpensive barrier for use in some roadside applications. Recently, cable or wire rope has gained popularity as a median barrier for the prevention of cross-median accidents. Cross-median accidents are typically violent collisions with a high probability of multiple serious injuries and deaths. Thus, the design trend is gravitating toward providing positive vehicle containment in wider medians for which barriers have not historically been warranted. Wire rope often provides a cost-effective solution for this design scenario. Field experience with cable or wire rope barriers has identified areas for design improvement. It is desirable that cables remain taut to improve interaction with the vehicle, reduce dynamic deflections, and minimize maintenance. Additionally, reduced design deflections result in more potential application sites. Recent research demonstrates that such improvements are practical and cost-effective. Besides the initial tension in the wire ropes, other factors that can have a significant influence on dynamic deflections include post spacing and horizontal curvature. Computer simulations with cable barriers with various post spacings and horizontal curvatures were used to develop guidelines for expected design deflections. Finally, full-scale crash tests were completed with a new, cost-effective cable terminal system, and a brief review of the design and crash test results is included.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/1851-10",""

In Chlamydomonas, adhesion and fusion of the plasma membranes of activated mt+ and mt- gametes is accomplished via specialized fusion organelles called mating structures. Herein, we identify the endogenous Fus1 protein, test the idea that Fus1 is at the site of fusion, and identify the step in fusion that requires Fus1. Our results show that Fus1 is a ∼95-kDa protein present on the external surface of both unactivated and activated mt+ gametes. Bioassays indicate that adhesion between mating type plus and mating type minus fusion organelles requires Fus1 and that Fus1 is functional only after gamete activation. Finally, immunofluorescence demonstrates that the Fus1 protein is present as an apical patch on unactivated gametes and redistributes during gamete activation over the entire surface of the microvillous-like activated plus mating structure, the fertilization tubule. Thus, Fus1 is present on mt+ gametes at the site of cell-cell fusion and essential for an early step in the fusion process.","",""

These unexpected findings suggested the possibility that gastrin gene products [mainly progastrin (PG)] may be directly or indirectly mediating the observed effects in colon cancer cells. Because colon cancer cells do not respond to exogenous PG, we examined the possibility of whether PG regulates Cox Vb expression in gastrin-responsive intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in vitro. Levels of Cox Vb RNA and protein were significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner in response to PG. Mitochondrial synthesis of ATP was also increased by approximately three- to fivefold in response to optimal concentrations (0.1-1.0 nm) of PG. Possible antiapoptotic effects of PG were additionally examined, because activation of caspases 9 and 3 had been noted in colon cancer cells downregulated for gastrin gene expression. We measured a significant loss in the levels of cyt c in the cytosol of PG-treated vs. control IEC cells, which correlated with a significant loss in the activation of caspases 9 and 3, resulting in a significant loss in DNA fragmentation on PG treatment of the cells. Our results thus suggest the novel possibility that the precursor PG peptide exerts direct antiapoptotic effects on IECs, which may contribute to the observed growth effects of PG on these cells. Additionally, Cox Vb gene appears to be an important intracellular target of PG, resulting in an increase in ATP levels, which may also contribute to the observed increase in the growth of target cells in response to PG.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpgi.00216.2003",""

BSCs decrease a patient's range of motion and their ability to perform activities of daily living. A benefit of exercise is an increase the patient's ability to perform and sustain activities of daily living. Therefore, we investigated whether patients who were involved in a supervised, hospital-based exercise program, in addition to physical and occupational therapy (PTEX), would have fewer surgical interventions than a nonexercise group receiving home-delivered physical and occupational therapy (PT) alone. We examined 53 patients at 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months postburn. The PTEX group (n = 27) completed a 12-week supervised exercise program starting at 6 months postburn. Exercise sessions were held three times per week, with duration of 60 to 90 minutes per session. Resistance and aerobic exercises were performed at 70 to 85% of the patient's maximal effort. In contrast, the PT group (n = 26) received a home rehabilitation program with no supervised exercise. Patients were evaluated at 3-month intervals for scar formation, range of motion, and need for surgery. At 12, 18, 24 months postburn, the number of patients in the PTEX group needing release of BSC was significantly lower than the number of patients in the PT group. The results indicate that patients would receive a significant benefit if enrolled in a supervised exercise and physiotherapy program with the exercise portion consisting of an aerobic and resistance-training component. This type of program is beneficial in decreasing the number of surgical interventions and should be incorporated as part of a postburn outpatient rehabilitation.","https://academic.oup.com/jbcr/article-pdf/24/1/57/23045820/00004630-200301000-00014.pdf",""

Various dynamic mechanical tests using cylindrical sand–asphalt samples mixed with pure binders, mastics, or both were also performed to estimate viscoelastic characteristics and fatigue behavior. To assess the filler effect, two distinctly compositionally different asphalt binders, AAD-1 and AAM-1, and two fillers, limestone and hydrated lime, were selected. Test results were analyzed using viscoelastic theory, a fatigue prediction model based on continuum damage mechanics, and a rheological composite model. The role of fillers in fatigue resistance was quantified, and induced mechanisms due to filler addition were investigated. The effect of hydrated lime, which is highly binder specific, as a filler was further discussed by comparing test results from hydrated lime filler and test results from limestone filler.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/1832-01",""

In an event that defines the end of the vegetative cycle, the λ holin S acts suddenly to permeabilize the membrane. This permeabilization enables the R endolysin to attack the cell wall, after which cell lysis occurs within seconds. A C-terminal fusion of the R endolysin with full-length β-galactosidase (β-Gal) was tested for lytic competence in the context of the late-gene expression system of an induced λ lysogen. Under these conditions, the hybrid R-β-Gal product, an active tetrameric β-Gal greater than 480 kDa in mass, was fully functional in lysis mediated by the S holin. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the lytic competence was not due to the proteolytic release of the endolysin domain of the R-β-Gal fusion protein. The ability of this massive complex to be released by the S holin suggests that S causes a generalized membrane disruption rather than a regular oligomeric membrane pore. Similar results were obtained with an early lysis variant of the S holin and also in parallel experiments with the T4 holin, T, in an identical lambda context. However, premature holin lesions triggered by depolarization of the membrane were nonpermissive for the hybrid endolysin, indicating that these premature lesions constituted less-profound damage to the membrane. Finally, a truncated T holin functional in lysis with the endolysin is completely incompetent for lysis with the hybrid endolysin. A model for the formation of the membrane lesion within homo-oligomeric rafts of holin proteins is discussed.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JB.185.3.779-787.2003",""

In order to solve the resulting set of equations, an appropriate boundary condition for the sheath model has to be specified at the sheath–plasma boundary. In the existing sheath models, this boundary condition is assumed to be stationary. In present article, we investigate the ion dynamics in both presheath region and sheath region by using numerical as well as analytical methods. It is found that the presheath introduces an additional time scale ωpre=VB/l (here, ℓ is the characteristic scale of the presheath and VB is the Bohm velocity). If the rf frequency ω is low enough so that ω⩽ωpre, the boundary condition for the sheath depends on the ion dynamics in the presheath. In the very low-frequency regime ω≪VB/l, an analytical expression for the ion current is obtained which agrees well with the numerical result.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/93/9/5034/19132760/5034_1_online.pdf",""

Background: True vertigo is estimated to occur in about 20% of MS patients. Lesions within the vestibular nuclei and in the root entry zone of cranial nerve VIII represent the most common locations where demyelinating activity can provoke vertigo in patients with MS. However, other causes of vertigo should be explored in MS patients in order to avoid unnecessar y treatment with corticosteroids and vestibular suppressants. Recently, we reviewed our four-year experience with new onset vertigo in our university-based MS population and found that benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (BPPV) to be the most common cause. A ll patients diagnosed with BPPV were treated successfully with particle repositioning maneuvers. The remaining patients were treated with conventional therapies appro priate for the specific diagnosis. Conclusions: Empiric treatments with corticosteroids and/or vestibular suppressants should not be employed until all MS patients undergo a careful bedside examination, which includes diagnostic positional and, if indicated, particle repositioning maneuvers.

BSCs decrease a patient's range of motion and their ability to perform activities of daily living. A benefit of exercise is an increase the patient's ability to perform and sustain activities of daily living. Therefore, we investigated whether patients who were involved in a supervised, hospital-based exercise program, in addition to physical and occupational therapy (PTEX), would have fewer surgical interventions than a nonexercise group receiving home-delivered physical and occupational therapy (PT) alone. We examined 53 patients at 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months postburn. The PTEX group (n = 27) completed a 12-week supervised exercise program starting at 6 months postburn. Exercise sessions were held three times per week, with duration of 60 to 90 minutes per session. Resistance and aerobic exercises were performed at 70 to 85% of the patient's maximal effort. In contrast, the PT group (n = 26) received a home rehabilitation program with no supervised exercise. Patients were evaluated at 3-month intervals for scar formation, range of motion, and need for surgery. At 12, 18, 24 months postburn, the number of patients in the PTEX group needing release of BSC was significantly lower than the number of patients in the PT group. The results indicate that patients would receive a significant benefit if enrolled in a supervised exercise and physiotherapy program with the exercise portion consisting of an aerobic and resistance-training component. This type of program is beneficial in decreasing the number of surgical interventions and should be incorporated as part of a postburn outpatient rehabilitation.","https://academic.oup.com/jbcr/article-pdf/24/1/57/23045820/00004630-200301000-00014.pdf",""

This study was carried out in samples of local Asian Indians and Caucasians to determine whether plasma cell membrane glycoprotein (PC)-1 K121Q and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) G972A polymorphisms contribute significantly to susceptibility to insulin resistance in Asian Indians. The frequency of carrying at least one copy of the PC-1 121Q variant in Asian Indians was significantly higher than that in Caucasians (P = 0.01), but the frequency was similar for IRS-1 972A (6% and 7%). A significantly higher insulin area under the curve during oral glucose tolerance testing (P &lt; 0.0001) and lower insulin sensitivity during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps (P = 0.04) were found in Asian Indians with PC-1 121Q variant compared with Asian Indians with wild-type PC-1 and with Caucasians with or without the polymorphism. IRS-1 972A was not associated with any change in insulin sensitivity. We conclude that the PC-1 K121Q polymorphism associates with primary insulin resistance in migrant Asian Indians. A relatively high frequency of this polymorphism thus may be one factor contributing to insulin resistance susceptibility in Asian Indians.

A recently described technique, based on the MU fraction method works well for large and asymmetric fields, but only when the calculation point is in the center of the field. Other existing methods based on beam‐segment superposition do not have this limitation. These beam summation methods, however, are difficult to implement in routine clinical MU calculation schemes. In this paper, we present a simple calculation method that estimates EDWFs at off‐axis calculation points in both symmetric and asymmetric fields. Our method, which also is based on the MU fraction method, similarly uses empirically determined field‐size corrections but also applies wedged‐field profiles to estimate EDWFs that are independent of calculation‐point location and field symmetry.

Here, T-DNA knockout (KO) mutations of each gene were isolated in a reverse genetic approach. The single KO mutants lacked a discernible phenotype. The double KO mutants, however, exhibited a complete inhibition of pollen germination, and this correlated with positive β-glucuronidase staining in the pollen of apyrase promoter:β-glucuronidase fusion transgenic lines. The vast majority of the pollen grains of these mutants were identical to wild type in size, shape, and nuclear state and were viable as assayed by metabolic activity and plasma membrane integrity. Complementation with either AtAPY1 or AtAPY2 cDNA rescued pollen germination, confirming that the phenotype was apyrase specific. Despite the redundancy of the two apyrases in rescue potential, transmission analyses suggested a greater role for AtAPY2 in male gamete success. The effect of mutant apyrase on the transmission through the female gametophyte was only marginal, and embryo development appeared normal in the absence of apyrases. The male-specific double KO mutation is fully penetrant and shows that apyrases play a crucial role in pollen germination.","http://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-pdf/131/4/1638/37473728/plphys_v131_4_1638.pdf",""

Previously, we showed that calcineurin phosphatase is required for hypertrophy and ECM synthesis in cultured mesangial cells. Therefore, we examined the effect of calcineurin inhibition on renal hypertrophy and ECM accumulation in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. After 2 wk of diabetes, calcineurin protein was increased in whole cortex and glomeruli in conjunction with increased phosphatase activity. Daily administration of cyclosporin A blocked accumulation of both calcineurin protein and calcineurin activity. Also associated with calcineurin upregulation was nuclear localization of the calcineurin substrate NFATc1. Inhibition of calcineurin reduced whole kidney hypertrophy and abolished glomerular hypertrophy in diabetic rats. Furthermore, calcineurin inhibition substantially reduced ECM accumulation in diabetic glomeruli but not in cortical tissue, suggesting a differential effect of calcineurin inhibition in glomerular vs. extraglomerular tissue. Corresponding increases in fibronectin mRNA and transforming growth factor-β mRNA were observed in tubulointerstitium but not in glomeruli. In summary, calcineurin plays an important role in glomerular hypertrophy and ECM accumulation in diabetic nephropathy.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajprenal.00158.2002",""

Recently, researchers have begun to consider how facial motion affects memory for faces. The authors offer a theoretical framework that synthesizes psychological findings on memory for moving faces. Three hypotheses about the possible roles of facial motion in memory are evaluated. In general, although facial motion is helpful for recognizing familiar/famous faces, its benefits are less certain with unfamiliar faces. Importantly, the implicit social signals provided by a moving face (e.g., gaze changes, expression, and facial speech) may mediate the effects of facial motion on recognition. Insights from the developmental literature, which highlight the significance of attention in the processing of social information from faces, are also discussed. Finally, a neural systems framework that considers both the processing of socially relevant motion information and static feature-based information is presented. This neural systems model provides a useful framework for understanding the divergent psychological findings.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1534582303002001002",""

Mapped loci identify 61.5% of the recombination events in this progeny set and reveal strong positive crossover interference acting across intervals of ≤50 cM. Significant variations in DNA marker density are related to possible centromeric regions and to probable chromosome structural rearrangements between Sorghum bicolor and S. propinquum, but not to variation in levels of intraspecific allelic richness. While cDNA and genomic clones are similarly distributed across the genome, SSR-containing clones show different abundance patterns. Rapidly evolving hypomethylated DNA may contribute to intraspecific genomic differentiation. Nonrandom distribution patterns of multiple loci detected by 357 probes suggest ancient chromosomal duplication followed by extensive rearrangement and gene loss. Exemplifying the value of these data for comparative genomics, we support and extend prior findings regarding maize-sorghum synteny—in particular, 45% of comparative loci fall outside the inferred colinear/syntenic regions, suggesting that many small rearrangements have occurred since maize-sorghum divergence. These genetically anchored sequence-tagged sites will foster many structural, functional and evolutionary genomic studies in major food, feed, and biomass crops.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/165/1/367/42052460/genetics0367.pdf",""

However, intracellular pathways that mediate growth effects of the precursor molecules are not known. In previous studies, we reported an increase in Tyr phosphorylation of pp60c-Src in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) in response to the fully processed form of gastrin [gastrin1–17 (G17)]. We have now examined whether c-Src kinase is similarly phosphorylated and activated in response to the full-length precursor molecule, progastrin (PG)1–80, (recombinant human PG) in IEC cells. We found a significant increase in pp60c-Src kinase activity in response to both G17 and PG (0.1–1.0 nm), suggesting that growth effects of both the precursor and fully processed gastrin molecules may be mediated via similar pathways. On the other hand, pp62c-Yes was not phosphorylated or activated in response to either G17 or PG. To examine whether c-Src kinase mediates proliferative effects of PG, IEC cells were microinjected with anti-Src-IgG and 3H-thymidine (3H-Tdr) uptake of the cells measured. Control cells received nonimmune IgG. The 3H-Tdr uptake of cells stimulated with 1.0 nm PG was significantly reduced in cells microinjected with anti-c-Src-IgG; control IgG had no effect. In cells stimulated with 1.0% fetal calf serum, microinjection with c-Src-IgG had no effect on 3H-Tdr uptake. The specificity of the effect was further confirmed by blocking the inhibitory effect of anti-c-Src-IgG with antigenic Src peptide.

Therapeutic strategies include blockade of individual receptors with monoclonal antibodies and inhibition of tyrosine kinase function. Trastuzumab is the first of these biologic therapies to be approved for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. Novel trastuzumab-based combinations are being investigated in patients with advanced breast cancer. Large clinical trials have also been launched in the adjuvant setting. Small molecules that inhibit specific tyrosine kinases (e.g., epidermal growth factor receptor, HER2) are in phase I and phase II clinical trials. Other growth-factor-targeted drugs that have reached clinical development include STI571 and antibodies directed at the insulin-like growth factor pathway. Biologic therapies directed against these important receptors are promising.

Next, a compact two-resistor (2R) model was created in Flotherm using compact smart parts. Values of junction-to-case and junction-to-board resistances were taken from experiments. Both the detailed model and the compact model were mounted on a 4-layered standard JEDEC board for natural convection in a standard JEDEC enclosure. With a nominal power of 0.75W applied at the junction, the detailed model and the 2R compact model showed a very good agreement. The results also compared well with experimental data. Next, two models were developed; a detailed model and a corresponding equivalent 2R compact model were mounted on a 4-layered standard JEDEC board and simulated for forced convection with an air velocity of 1 m/s. With a nominal power of 0.75 W applied at the junction, maximum junction temperatures were computed and once again showed very good agreement. Experimental data for forced convection indicated that the maximum junction temperature was in good agreement to the compact model. The study was further extended to do a board level analysis where the detailed TSOP models were mounted on a 6-layered standard DIMM board. In the single sided board arrangement nine such compact models were mounted on one side of the board and maximum junction temperature was noted. Then, the detailed models were replaced by compact models and simulated for forced convection with an air velocity of 1 m/s. Good agreement between detailed model and compact model was seen for the board level analysis. Further the compact models were simulated for a double-sided arrangement in which eighteen such compact models were mounted nine on each sided of the board. The assembly was simulated for forced convection with an air velocity of 1 m/s. Nominal power applied at junction for each of the eighteen modules was 0.3 W. Maximum temperature for the double sided arrangement of DIMM board was thus computed.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/InterPACK/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IPACK2003-35279/2591184/867_1.pdf",""

Modeling methodologies that seek to capture this underlying order give rise to a special form of the equations of motion, called a port controlled Hamiltonian structure with damping (PCHD). Often the natural behavior of a system is unacceptable for a desired application, and must be modified. A body of work on passivity-based control exists that shows how to use Casimir functions—certain invariant quantities of the open-loop PCHD—to reshape the natural dynamics in a desired way. We seek to apply this approach to an electrostatically-actuated MEMS device subject to the saddle-node bifurcation known as snap-through. We show that the equations describing this system do not have an appropriate Casimir function, but that they can be suitably modified through an implementable output feedback. We fully characterize the Casimirs of the modified system, and show how they may be used to eliminate snap-through. Unfortunately the transient behavior of the resulting closed-loop system is governed by the damping of the mechanical subsystem, which may or may not provide adequate performance.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2003-42461/2600731/687_1.pdf",""

Control schemes have been proposed to eliminate snapthrough. These stabilizing controllers can be implemented using relatively straight forward current and voltage measurements. However, in order to alter the transient behavior of the system, for example to reduce settling time, or to minimize the likelihood of contacting the bottom electrode, the controller should also include terms dependent on the velocity of the movable electrode. Direct sensing of this velocity during normal device operation is typically not feasible. In this paper we show how the electrode velocity may be indirectly sensed using only capacitance and voltage measurements. Our approach is based on well known techniques of nonlinear observer design, and provides arbitrary fast linear error dynamics.

The dynamic properties of these specimens were measured in resonant column and torsional shear (RCTS) tests, while the undrained shear strength was measured in unconsolidated-undrained (UU) triaxial compression tests. For weakly cemented, natural materials like this, it is difficult to obtain reliable properties from laboratory tests because sampling and handling of the soil specimens damages the particle cementation to an unknown degree. Artificially cemented specimens can be studied to better understand this problem. In this work, the strength and dynamic properties of artificially cemented sand were also measured using RCTS and UU tests. The artificially cemented specimens were formed by mixing uniform sand with a sodium silicate solution. The degree of cementation was varied by using different sodium silicate concentrations. This approach could be used to reproduce cemented test specimens in the laboratory with similar mechanical properties as cemented offshore soils. The results from this limited study show that the small-strain dynamic properties measured in the laboratory, and their variation with confining pressure, clearly identifies disturbance in the calcareous soils.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/OMAE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/OMAE2003-37091/4545910/133_1.pdf",""

Under optimized conditions, the room-temperature CL intensity of QDs can be improved by ∼16 times. We speculate that the increased CL intensity is caused by the efficient capture of electrons from the reservoir of the delta-doped layer into the QDs, which, to some extent, counterbalances the thermal escape of electrons from the QDs. A temperature-dependent CL study of InP QDs grown without Si delta doping shows a quenching of the CL at high temperatures, which supports the unipolar escape of electrons from QDs, while delta-doped QDs show an anomalous behavior. The QD integrated CL intensity increases with temperature and then decreases after 200 K. This anomalous behavior is interpreted as caused by competition between two processes: (1) thermal activation of carriers out of the potential well introduced by delta doping and then capture by QDs, which enhances the CL intensity; and (2) quenching of the CL due to thermal activation of carriers out of the QDs.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article-pdf/82/24/4343/18578959/4343_1_online.pdf",""

Because clonality is the hallmark of malignancy, we have developed an assay that uses the polymerase chain reaction to amplify the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes and T-cell receptor genes to detect the presence of a clonal lymphocyte population. The assay detected clonally rearranged antigen receptor genes in 91% of the 77 dogs with lymphoid malignancy. Of the 24 dogs tested, that were either healthy or had clearly defined conditions not related to lymphoid malignancy, a clonally rearranged antigen receptor gene was found in one (a dog with Ehrlichia canis infection). Gene rearrangement was appropriate for the immunophenotype (immunoglobulin gene rearrangement in B-cell leukemias and T-cell receptor gene rearrangement in T-cell leukemias). Dilution analysis showed that the clonal rearrangement could be detected when 0.1–10% of the DNA was derived from neoplastic cells, depending on the source tissue. Potential applications of this assay include the diagnosis of lymphoma or leukemia in biopsy samples, cavity fluids, fine needle aspirates, bone marrow and peripheral blood; the determination of lineage (B or T cell); staging of lymphoma; and detection of residual disease after chemotherapy.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1354/vp.40-1-32",""

Developments in mathematics, physics, biology, economics, and psychology over the last four decades, however, have led to the formulation of theories that suggest new models of the adjustment process.

For a fixed volume of deposited InP, the size of the QDs decreases with an increase in the Al concentration in the In0.5(AlxGa1−x)0.5P matrix. We suggest that this variation in QD size is a result of an alloying effect caused by atomic intermixing between the InP dots and the underlying matrix material. The stronger intermixing between InP and the Ga-rich matrices (relative to Al-rich matrices) results in larger QDs on these surfaces. The intermixing effect, as expected, reduces the lattice mismatch and, as a result, leads to a larger critical thickness of the wetting layer when the growth temperature is higher. The growth of InP QDs on an InAlP matrix with a thin GaP intermediate buffer layer also supports the interpretation as an intermixing effect.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article-pdf/83/7/1349/18580989/1349_1_online.pdf",""

We found a significant reduction in narial coherence in hypoxic vagotomized toads indicating that pulmonary mechanoreceptor feedback modulates narial opening duration.

We here describe a monoclonal antibody (mAb), 137–26, that binds to the C5a moiety of human C5 and neutralizes the effects of C5a without interfering with C5 cleavage and the subsequent formation of lytic C5b-9 complex. Mouse anti-human C5 mAbs were generated and the reactivity with C5 and C5a was detected by ELISA and surface plasmon resonance. The inhibition of C5a binding to C5a receptor was studied using a radioligand binding assay. The effects of the antibody on C5a functions were examined using isolated neutrophils and a novel human whole blood model of inflammation. Haemolytic assays were used to study the effect on complement-mediated lysis. mAb 137–26 reacted with both solid- and solution-phase C5 and C5a in a dose-dependent manner with high affinity. The antibody competed C5a binding to C5a receptor and inhibited C5a-mediated chemotaxis of neutrophils. Furthermore, the antibody effectively abrogated complement-dependent E. coli-induced CD11b up-regulation and oxidative burst in neutrophils of human whole blood. mAb 137–26 was more potent than a C5a receptor antagonist and a previously described anti-C5a antibody. mAb 137–26 did not inhibit complement-mediated lysis, nor did it activate complement itself. Together, mAb 137–26 binds both the C5a moiety of native C5 and free C5a, thereby effectively neutralizing the biological effects of C5a. The antibody may have therapeutic potential in inflammatory diseases where C5a inhibition combined with an operative lytic pathway of C5b-9 is particularly desired.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1046%2Fj.1365-2249.2003.02213.x",""

Thicker oxide shells are obtained by oxidation in O2 ambient compared with NO ambient. Oxidation in O2 is observed to be self-limiting at temperatures below the viscoelastic temperature of SiO2 because of compressive stress normal to the SiO2/Si interface, which retards the surface oxidation rate. Oxidation in NO also results in self-limiting oxidation due to the incorporation of N at the Si/SiOx interface. This N-rich interfacial layer acts as an effective barrier against oxidant diffusion and also blocks the reaction sites on the Si surface. Therefore, NO oxidation is successful in slowing further oxidation of Si cores, even in a severe oxidizing ambient such as O2 at 1050 °C.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/93/9/5637/19132818/5637_1_online.pdf",""

The characteristics of the radial and axial air-gap flows have been of general interest in many engineering applications. A rotating air gap flow is very complex, and in general, can be categorized as a continuum flow, slip flow, and free molecule flow, depending on the ratio of its mean free path to the air gap dimension. For a continuum flow between concentric rotating cylinders, secondary flow of rows of circumferential Taylor vortices in the air gap due to centrifugal flow instability of a curved flow at relatively high rotating speeds will typically be formed. As the air pressure in the air gap drops significantly, rarefied gas flow, departure from continuum flow, occurs when the mean free path becomes relatively large compared to the air gap dimension. This paper has developed and summarized an analytical approach to predict high speed windage losses (rotor tip velocities up to 900 m/s) at low rotor cavity air pressures (0.1 torr to 10 torr). The predicted transient windage losses at various air pressures and high rotor speeds are compared with measured windage losses generated in continuum and slip flow regimes. The agreements between the predicted and measured windage losses are relatively well.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/HT/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/HT2003-47118/4551540/15_1.pdf",""

We performed numerical analysis for a number of focal lengths considering the above-mentioned factors.

Because of the dependence of permeability on suction and the nonlinearity of the suction–moisture relationship, the analytical formulation for flow through unsaturated soils is highly nonlinear. An approximate linear analysis of this problem, which was originally proposed by Peter Mitchell, was investigated. One advantage of this approximate analysis is that it can provide the practical basis for measuring soil moisture diffusion characteristics in laboratory tests. A second advantage is that the linear formulation provides an analytical tool accessible to practitioners. Mitchell originally based his formulation on a relatively restrictive assumption on the permeability-versus-suction relationship. An approach to circumventing that restriction is proposed. The findings of a laboratory test program that uses Mitchell’s formulation to estimate a soil’s moisture diffusion characteristics are presented. Finally, some simple analytical predictions demonstrate the practical significance of the soil moisture diffusion properties.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/1821-09",""

Moreover, the ordering improves and the density of QDs increases with an increase in the deposition of InP. The room-temperature CL intensity of InP QDs grown on a 25° off In0.5(Al0.6Ga0.4)0.5P is much stronger than that for InP QDs grown on a 25°-off In0.5Al0.5P matrix.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article-pdf/83/3/476/18580113/476_1_online.pdf",""

More recently, psychopathy has been extended to children and adolescents with correlates to maladaptive personality traits, violent behavior, and noncompliance with institutional rules. To screen for adolescent psychopathy, the Antisocial Process Screening Device (APSD) was developed as a 20-item self-report measure of psychopathy. The original validation of the APSD was limited to samples of clinic-referred and community-based children. In extending this research to delinquent populations, the current article uses two separate samples of adolescent offenders incarcerated in a maximum security facility (n = 78) and a local juvenile detention facility (n = 77). As evidence of criterion-related validity, the APSD was compared with two versions of the Psychopathy Checklist that yielded mixed results. Construct validity was examined via a confirmatory factor analysis that provided support for a three-factor model of the APSD.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1073191103010002005",""

The herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) SCP was shown to be horn shaped and to specifically bind the upper domain of each major capsid protein in hexons but not in pentons. In Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), the protein encoded by the ORF65 gene (pORF65) is the putative SCP but its location remains controversial due to the absence of such horn-shaped densities from both the pentons and hexons of the KSHV capsid reconstructions. To directly locate the KSHV SCP, we have used electron cryomicroscopy and three-dimensional reconstruction techniques to compare the three-dimensional structure of KSHV capsids to that of anti-pORF65 antibody-labeled capsids. Our difference map shows prominent antibody densities bound to the tips of the hexons but not to pentons, indicating that KSHV SCP is attached to the upper domain of the major capsid protein in hexons but not to that in pentons, similar to HSV-1 SCP. The lack of horn-shaped densities on the hexons indicates that KSHV SCP exhibits structural features that are substantially different from those of HSV-1 SCP. The location of SCP at the outermost regions of the capsid suggests a possible role in mediating capsid interactions with the tegument and cytoskeletal proteins during infection.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.77.7.4291-4297.2003",""

In previous implementations of the hydrodynamic formulation, various time-consuming fitting techniques of limited accuracy were used to evaluate these derivatives around each fluid element in an evolving ensemble. In this study, equations of motion are developed for the spatial derivatives themselves and a small set of these are integrated along quantum trajectories concurrently with the equations for C and S. Significantly, quantum effects can be included at various orders of approximation, no spatial fitting is involved, there are no basis set expansions, and single quantum trajectories (rather than correlated ensembles) may be propagated, one at a time. Excellent results are obtained when the derivative propagation method is applied to anharmonic potentials involving barrier transmission.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/118/22/9911/19082519/9911_1_online.pdf",""

The study included freeway guide signs mounted in an overhead position and exclusively illuminated with vehicle headlamps. A total of 60 subjects divided into three age groups participated in this nighttime study. All 60 subjects drove two vehicles, a modern sport utility vehicle (SUV) and a late-model passenger car. The findings show that microprismatic sheeting does provide statistically longer legibility distances than encapsulated sheeting. Overall, the improvement was 53 ft, or 9.5%. However, for the modern SUV, the improvement was much greater (78 ft) compared with the late-model passenger car (28 ft). The main differences are related to the evolution of vehicle design and specifications. Today’s United States citizens prefer large vehicles such as an SUV, pickup, and minivan. These vehicles also meet recently revised headlamp specifications. These two issues inherently reduce the amount of headlamp light retroreflected from the sign back to the driver. Unfortunately, these counterproductive trends show signs of continuing. Considering the increasing proportion of older drivers in the United States, it becomes even more critical that transportation agencies do all they can to increase overhead-sign luminance. The findings show that increasing overhead-sign luminance by switching from encapsulated retroreflective sheeting to microprismatic retro-reflective sheeting results in significantly longer legibility distances. The magnitude of the difference will continue to increase as long as the SUV-like proportion of the U.S. fleet continues to grow and headlamp specifications continue to direct less light toward overhead signs.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/1844-08",""

Because visual cortex is highly plastic during a critical period of development, cortical deficits resulting from early abnormal visual experience often mirror the nature of interocular decorrelation of neural signals from the two eyes. In the preceding paper, we demonstrated that monkeys that experienced early alternating monocular defocus (–1.5, –3.0, or –6.0 D) show deficits in stereopsis that generally reflected the magnitude of imposed monocular defocus. Because these results indicated that alternating monocular defocus affected the higher spatial frequency components of visual scenes more severely, we employed microelectrode recording methods to investigate whether V1 neurons in these lens-reared monkeys exhibited spatial-frequency-dependent alterations in their binocular response properties. We found that a neuron's sensitivity to interocular spatial phase disparity was reduced in the treated monkeys and that this reduction was generally more severe for units tuned to higher spatial frequencies. In the majority of the affected units, the disparity-sensitivity loss was associated with interocular differences in monocular receptive field properties. The present results suggest that the behavioral deficits in stereopsis produced by abnormal visual experience reflect at least in part the constraints imposed by alterations at the earliest stages of binocular cortical processing and support the hypothesis that the local disparity processing mechanisms in primates are spatially tuned and can be independently compromised by early abnormal visual experience.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jn.00975.2002",""

This paper contains recent test results and numerical simulations showing the reconsolidation behavior of the soil around the installed caisson. The 100-mm diameter caisson prototype was proportionally dimensioned to represent a typical offshore suction caisson. Tests were conducted in normally consolidated deposits of kaolinite clay, which were formed to simulate common seafloor conditions. Large tanks of the soil were prepared by consolidating a slurry to a final thickness of about 1.1 m, a process that took about eight months. Caissons were then installed using dead weight and/or suction. Instrumentation was used to record displacements, axial forces, and pore water pressures during installation and extraction of the caisson. Tests with the prototype caisson, as well as tests with a flat plate inserted vertically into the test bed deposit, show an increase in pullout capacity with time (set-up) as the soil reconsolidates following installation. Data are presented showing the dissipation of excess pore water pressures on the interior and exterior of the prototype caisson. The measured pore pressures are also compared to results from a finite element simulation of the reconsolidation process. These results demonstrate how the pullout capacity of a suction caisson may be limited if large loads are applied prior to full soil reconsolidation.","http://onepetro.org/OTCONF/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.4043/15263-MS/1870592/otc-15263-ms.pdf",""

D. Anderson Cancer Center. The system consists of a 6‐MV linear accelerator (LINAC) equipped with a Tyco/Radionics miniature multileaf collimator (mMLC). For the conventional SRS treatment, the circular collimator housing can be attached to the opening window of the mMLC. The treatment delivery system is integrated with a radiotherapy treatment planning system and a record‐and‐verify system. The purpose of this study is to report the characteristics, performance, benefits, and the clinical applications of this delivery system. The technical specifications of the LINAC and mMLC were tested, and all the specifications were met. The 80% to 20% penumbral width for each mMLC leaf is approximately 3 mm and is nearly independent of the off‐axis positions of a leaf. The maximum interleaf leakage is 1.4% (1.1% on average) and the maximum intra‐leaf leakage is 1.0% (0.9% on average). The leaf position precision is better than 0.5 mm for all the leaves. The integration of the SRS/SRT treatment planning system, mMLC, and LINAC has been evaluated successfully for transferring the patient treatment data file through radiotherapy treatment planning system to the patient information and treatment record‐and‐verify server and the mMLC controller. Subsequently, the auto‐sequential treatment delivery for SRS, CSRS/CSRT, and the step‐and‐shoot intensity‐modulated radiotherapy has also been tested successfully. The accuracy of dose delivery was evaluated for a 2‐cm spherical target in a Radiological Physics Center SRS head phantom with GAFChromic films and TLD. Five non‐coplanar arcs, using a 2‐cm diameter circular collimator, were used for this simulation treatment. The accuracy to aim the center of the spherical target was within 0.5 mm and the deviation of dose delivery to the isocenter of the target was within 2% of the calculated dose. For the irregularly shaped tumor, a tissue‐equivalent head phantom was used to evaluate the accuracy of dose delivery for using either geometric conformal treatment or IMRT The accuracy of dose delivery to the isocenter was within 2% and 3% of the calculated dose, respectively. From October 26, 1999 to September 30, 2002, we treated over 400 SRS patients and 70 SRT patients. Four representative cases are presented to illustrate the capabilities of this dedicated unit in performing conventional SRS, CSRS, and CSRT. For all the cases, the geometric conformal‐plan dose distributions showed a high degree of conformity to the target shape. The degree of conformity can be evaluated using the target‐volume‐ratio (TVR). Our preferred TVR values for highly conformed dose distributions range from 1.6 to 2.0. The patient setup reproducibility for the Gill‐Thomas‐Cosman (GTC) noninvasive head frame ranges from 0.5 to 1 mm, and the head and neck noninvasive frame is within 2 mm. The integrated treatment delivery system offers excellent conformation for complicated planning target volumes with the stereotactic setup approach, ensuring that dose delivery can be achieved within the specified accuracy. In addition, the treatment time is comparable with that of single isocenter multiple‐arc treatments.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1120%2Fjacmp.v4i4.2496",""

This scheme does not require knowledge of the transition states (saddle points) or that of the final states. A transition path within a given time interval (0,tf) consists of an activation path during (0,tM) and a deactivation path during (tM,tf) (0&lt;tM&lt;tf) joined at an intermediate time tM. The activation path is a solution to a Langevin equation with negative friction, while the deactivation path is that to a regular Langevin equation with positive friction. Each transition path so generated carries a determined statistical weight. Typical transition paths are found for two-particle and three-particle clusters. A two-particle cluster adjusts its orientation to the direction of the narrow channel and then slides through it. A three-particle cluster completes a transition by openning one of its three bonds, becoming linear, and sliding through the channel.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/119/24/12749/19253184/12749_1_online.pdf",""

The orogen exposed near Van Horn, Texas, displays a transition from the mid‐amphibolite‐facies metamorphic core to a foreland fold and thrust belt. In this paper, detailed structural mapping and analyses, presented for key exposures of the metamorphic rocks, the Mesoproterozoic Carrizo Mountain Group, show a southeastward increase in number of deformational phases and intensity of deformation. The central portion is dominated by oblique northwest convergence, which produced two phases of northwest verging folds and synchronous, oblique reverse and dextral shearing. The thick parts of pre‐tectonic mafic plutons, which had been emplaced as locally discordant sills, control the spatial distribution of structures. Two dominant phases of folds form Type 0 interference patterns (essentially coaxial and coplanar; i.e., fold tightening was dominant). This central belt also contains en echelon reverse to oblique shear zones and comprises a transfer zone within the orogen between structurally higher and lower major shear zones. Overall, the mapped part of the central Carrizo Mountains represents localized dextral transpression within a larger region dominated by reverse motion, possibly indicating a change through time from orthogonal to oblique contraction. Further south in the Bass Canyon region, the earlier fold generations are refolded into Type 2 (“mushroom”) interference patterns. These structures show a westward vergence and are kinematically linked to those further north across a zone of disharmonic folding and heterogeneous shear. The structure and kinematics of the polyphase deformation and ductile shearing in the metamorphic portion of the orogen is compatible with that seen in the foreland fold‐thrust belt, suggesting that in both foreland and hinterland, transpression was a characteristic feature of the west Texas Grenville orogeny. The timing and kinematics of deformation in the Van Horn exposures contrasts with that seen in the Llano uplift, but compares favorably with those of the Natal belt, South Africa, a relationship with implications for recently proposed reconstructions of Rodinia.","https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2001TC001316",""

Therefore, we initiated a cooperative mark-recapture program with local sport-fishing groups to evaluate movement of Cichla in the Cinaruco River, Venezuela and to promote conservation awareness. Between January 1999 and May 2003, we tagged 2,224 individuals of three species of Cichla (C. temensis, C. orinocensis, and C. intermedia) with uniquely numbered floy tags. Over 52 months, 2.8% of the tagged fishes were recaptured. Most recaptures occurred within 1 km of the tagging location; however, a few large C. temensis moved up to 21 km, demonstrating the potential for longer distance movement in this species. The distance between tagging and recapture locations was not significantly correlated with the time interval between tagging and recapture. Distance moved was significantly related to fish size and period of the annual hydrological cycle. Implications for management and conservation of these species and future research directions are discussed.","http://www.scielo.br/pdf/ni/v1n2/v1n2a06.pdf",""

Clinicopathological and operative factors that may contribute to postoperative pancreatic leak were evaluated. Methods: A retrospective review of the medical records of 126 patients who underwent left pancreatectomy between June 1990 and December 1999 at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center was performed. Results: Indications for left pancreatectomy included pancreatic neoplasms (n = 42; 33·3 per cent), en bloc resection for management of retroperitoneal sarcoma (n = 21; 16·7 per cent), gastric adenocarcinoma (n = 14; 11·1 per cent), renal cell carcinoma (n = 11; 8·7 per cent) and other tumours or benign conditions (n = 38; 30·2 per cent). Pancreatic parenchymal closure was accomplished by a hand-sewn technique, mechanical stapling, or a combination of the two in 83, 20 and 15 patients respectively. No form of parenchymal closure was used in eight patients. Identification of the pancreatic duct and suture ligation was performed in 73 patients (57·9 per cent). Twenty-five patients (19·8 per cent) developed a pancreatic leak. For subgroups having duct ligation or no duct ligation, pancreatic leak rates were 9·6 per cent (seven of 73 patients) and 34·0 per cent (18 of 53 patients) respectively (P &lt; 0·001). Multivariate analysis including clinicopathological and operative factors indicated that failure to ligate the pancreatic duct was the only feature associated with an increased risk for pancreatic leak (odds ratio 5·0 (95 per cent confidence interval 2·0 to 10·0); P = 0·001). Conclusion: Pancreatic leak remains a common complication after left pancreatectomy. The incidence of leak is reduced significantly when the pancreatic duct is identified and directly ligated during left pancreatectomy.","http://academic.oup.com/bjs/article-pdf/90/2/190/36727202/bjs4032.pdf",""

It has been shown to be effective in the clean up of a wide range of contaminants from volatile organics to heavy oils. A removal on the order of 99.99% of the contaminants has been documented in several field tests. This is a very robust technology that could prove invaluable in the remediation of saturated zone contamination. To date, however, there has been little research into the feasibility of its application when contaminants are located in the saturated zone. To this end, two-dimensional numerical simulations using a commercial reservoir simulator were performed. The contaminant type, aquifer permeability, and hydraulic gradient are some of the factors that may affect the use of ISTD in the saturated zone. Simulations were run varying these parameters to ascertain their effects upon process performance. The results show that it is possible to use ISTD in the saturated zone and that the remediation time is dependent upon these factors.","https://onepetro.org/SPEHSSE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/81204-MS/2901263/spe-81204-ms.pdf",""

To examine the mechanisms by which these expanded repeat ARs (Exp-ARs) are toxic to neurons, we have established and characterized a cell culture model by stably transfecting SH-SY 5Y neuroblastoma cells with cDNAs containing either normal AR (81 series; 23 Gins) or Exp-AR (902 series; 56 Gins). At a low passage number, no differences in cell morphology, growth properties, or susceptibility to toxic insults were observed between clones expressing normal AR or Exp-AR. Initially, both types of cultures were found to express similar levels of specific hormone binding in monoiayer binding assays. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated the vast majority of both the normal AR and Exp-AR were localized to the nucleus in the absence and presence of androgen. As the 902 series of clones were propagated, the Exp-AR content in the cells appeared to decline progressively. However, this decrease actually reflects a gradual disappearance of the Exp-AR cell population. No such selection occurred during the propagation of cells expressing the normal AR. This selection against cells expressing physiological levels of Exp-AR occurs in the absence of intracellular aggregates and suggests that mechanisms other than those Involving the formation of aggregates underlie the observed toxicity of Exp-ARs.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/153537020322800815",""

The nematocidal drug ivermectin is believed to kill worms by opening a glutamate-gated chloride channel (AVR-15) on pharyngeal muscle, causing complete pumping inhibition.

Nonlinearity matrix elements which describe the coupling of harmonic interactions are used to characterize velocity waveform distortion. In contrast to isotropic solids and the (001) plane of cubic crystals, the nonlinearity matrix elements usually cannot be written in a real-valued form. As a result, the harmonic components are not necessarily in phase, and dramatic variations in waveforms and propagation curves can be observed. Simulations are performed for initially monofrequency surface waves. In some directions the waveforms distort in a manner similar to nonlinear Rayleigh waves, while in other directions the velocity waveforms distort asymmetrically and the formation of shocks and cusped peaks is less distinct. In some cases, oscillations occur near the shocks and peaks because of phase differences between harmonics. A mathematical transformation based on the phase of the matrix elements is shown to provide a reasonable approximation of asymmetric waveform distortion in cases where the matrix elements have similar phase.","https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article-pdf/113/3/1293/8091789/1293_1_online.pdf",""

Two dosage levels of each stabiliser and three curing periods were investigated. Strength and volume change behavioural tests, including unconfined compressive strength, vertical swell, linear shrinkage and Atterberg tests, were conducted on both control and stabilised soils. Test results showed that the sulphate-resistant cement and lime mixed with fibres provided the most effective stabilisation on all four soils. Both fly ash and GGBFS stabilisation methods provided average-to-moderate improvements in soil properties.

In addition to the immediate impact of in-situ sensors as tools for real-time, reactive reservoir management and control, usage of in-situ pressure sensors has long-term benefits. Devising an optimal macro-management strategy for hydrocarbon reservoirs requires more than a tool for instantaneous monitoring and control. Precise knowledge of the spatial distribution of petrophysical properties is essential for accurate reservoir delineation, management, and production forecasting. From the formation evaluation viewpoint, large volumes of flow-related data constitute an attractive prospect for robust and accurate characterization of reservoirs. In addition to static information in the form of geostatistical, seismic, and geologic data, usage of dynamic measurements remains imperative to construct accurate reservoir models amenable to production forecast.","https://onepetro.org/SPEATCE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/84375-MS/2897140/spe-84375-ms.pdf",""

In carbonates, when acid is injected, selective dissolution of the rock takes place creating highly permeable flow channels, called wormholes. In general, for a matrix acidizing treatment in carbonates, the deeper the wormholes penetrate into the formation, the better the outcome, as characterized by a lower skin factor. Thus, the deeper the wormhole penetration achieved with a given volume of acid, the more efficient the treatment. In this paper, we present laboratory results that show that wormhole propagation is enhanced by injecting nitrogen gas ahead of the acid.","https://onepetro.org/SPEEFDC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/82273-MS/2892690/spe-82273-ms.pdf",""

Steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) is a transcription factor for several genes encoding steroidogenic enzymes. However, the level of SF-1 expression decreases in the human corpus luteum (CL) after ovulation. Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) is another member of the orphan nuclear receptor family. We hypothesize that LRH-1, rather than SF-1, plays an essential role in the regulation of corpus luteum steroidogenesis. Semiquantitative RT-PCR and real-time PCR were performed to quantify the level of LRH-1 expression and correlate with HSD3B2 level. Cell transfection, mutation analysis, and EMSA were performed to examine the role of LRH-1 in the regulation of HSD3B2. LRH-1 expression was higher in CL, compared with mature ovarian follicles. Cotransfection of granulosa cells with HSD3B2 and LRH-1 resulted in a 10-fold increase of transcription. DAX-1 inhibited LRH-1-stimulated HSD3B2, which was maintained in the presence of dibutyryl cAMP. Mutation of the either of the two putative LRH-1 binding sites, which were confirmed by EMSA, in the HSD3B2 promoter decreased LRH-1 stimulation. Our findings suggest that LRH-1 is highly expressed in CL, and it plays an essential role in the regulation of HSD3B2.","http://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-pdf/88/12/6020/9064823/jcem6020.pdf",""

The objective was to determine if other tests give more reproducible results in a more timely fashion than Texas’s current sulfate test method (Tex-620-J), a gravimetric method. Literature review and interviews with commercial soil testing laboratories revealed three techniques to compare with Tex-620-J: ion chromatography, conductivity, and colorimetry/spectrophotometry. Soils were manufactured with known sulfate (gypsum and anhydrite) concentrations and sent to laboratories that performed gravimetric analysis and ion chromatography. Conductivity and colorimetric testing were performed in-house. Testing showed that Tex-620-J is not very precise, which creates the need for an unrealistic number of samples to obtain an accurate estimate of the sulfate concentration. To define the 95% confidence interval for true sulfate content to within ±10% of the true known value for a concentration of 5,000 ppm, Tex-620-J requires 43 tests; ion chromatography requires 14 tests. The colorimeter achieved the desired results in only one test, based on sulfate standard solutions. Results of this study revealed the difficulty with obtaining accurate sulfate measurements in the laboratory and indicated a few inexpensive pieces of equipment that can be used in both the field and laboratory settings that may yield better results.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/1837-01",""

We choose specific boundary value problems to illustrate the fact that we could be grossly in error, both qualitatively and quantitatively, with regard to local measures such as stresses and strains. In the examples considered, we find that, for global quantities such as applied forces and moments, the error could be significant. Not only could the material parameters found from, say, an extension test and torsion test, which neglect the inhomogeneity of the body, be quite different from one that incorporates the inhomogeneity, but also the values for the material parameter in the homogenized approximation gleaned from these different experiments could be different. In the process of elucidating our thesis, we investigate an important class of deformations, which in view of the paucity of boundary value problems that have been solved for non-linear inhomogeneous solids is worth documenting in its own right.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/10812865030084002",""

Knowledge of the mechanisms of action of the NTD AFs has lagged, compared with that concerning other important domains of the NHRs. In part, this is because the NTD AFs appear to be unfolded when expressed as recombinant proteins. Recent studies have begun to shed light on the structure and function of the NTD AFs. Recombinant NTD AFs can be made to fold by application of certain osmolytes or when expressed in conjunction with a DNA-binding domain by binding that DNA-binding domain to a DNA response element. The sequence of the DNA binding site may affect the functional state of the AFs domain. If properly folded, NTD AFs can bind certain cofactors and primary transcription factors. Through these, and/or by direct interactions, the NTD AFs may interact with the AF2 domain in the ligand binding, carboxy-terminal portion of the NHRs. We propose models for the folding of the NTD AFs and their protein-protein interactions.","http://academic.oup.com/mend/article-pdf/17/1/1/8962568/mend0001.pdf",""

MTC PMS was evaluated to determine the extent to which the software can support the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) 34 reporting requirements, established in 1999. A local agency PMS can take information from a pavement network database to produce useful reports, which can be utilized jointly with the information from other assets managed by an agency to support the requirements for a comprehensive asset management system and other reporting requirements. The objective of this study was to elaborate GASB 34 requirements for reporting infrastructure assets, examine the capabilities of MTC PMS in supporting those standard requirements, and recommend any modifications of MTC PMS needed to better support GASB 34. It is evident from the study that MTC PMS has the capability, to some extent, of supporting GASB 34 for reporting on a pavement network according to both the GASB 34 reporting methods: the depreciation method and the modified approach. It partially supports the prerequisites for using the modified approach, which require that the managing agency have an asset management system with certain designated characteristics. Some modifications of MTC PMS software were proposed to make this management system more effective as a tool supporting an asset management system and overall GASB 34 requirements.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/1819a-04",""

In this paper, we try to determine in what sense these models are viable to describe protein evolution. An important first step toward this goal is to establish whether there are any limitations on the lattice model, such as on heterogeneity of the interactions and the size and topology of the native folds, that are necessary before cooperative (2-statelike) folding behavior typical of small proteins evolves robustly from the sequence selection process. The model we construct to test this feature selects sequences that fold reliably to a fixed topology on relevant timescales near their folding transition temperatures. The cross-chain (nonbonded) interactions are defined by empirical amino acid contact potentials, and the sequences evolve by random drift subject to the selection criteria. We investigate the folding profiles of these evolutionarily selected sequences in terms of the free energy, F(Q), and the participation of native contacts, Qj(Q), along a folding reaction coordinate Q (the percentage of native contacts formed). Both size and topology effects are evident in the results, and weakly heterogeneous, 2-statelike folding behavior emerges most consistently from larger folds that are specially selected to suppress the effect of heterogeneity in native interactions.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/118/7/3342/19321862/3342_1_online.pdf",""

There has been rapid deployment of intelligent transportation system (ITS) technologies in most urban areas of North America in the last 10 years. While ITSs are developed primarily for real-time traffic operations, the data are typically archived and available for traffic microsimulation calibration. A methodology, based on the sequential simplex algorithm, that uses ITS data to calibrate microsimulation models is presented. The test bed is a 23-km section of Interstate 10 in Houston, Texas. Two microsimulation models, CORSIM and TRANSIMS, were calibrated for two different demand matrices and three periods (morning peak, evening peak, and off-peak). It was found for the morning peak that the simplex algorithm had better results then either the default values or a simple, manual calibration. As the level of congestion decreased, the effectiveness of the simplex approach also decreased, as compared with standard techniques.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/1855-10",""
