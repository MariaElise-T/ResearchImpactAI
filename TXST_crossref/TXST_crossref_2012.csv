The methods of design, optimization, and analysis were carried out with COMSOL Multiphysics 4.2a under the assumption of no damping with free vibrations.

Since its introduction, RIFA has been shown to negatively affect a wide range of native vertebrate and invertebrate species. The purposes of this study were to delineate the annual RIFA activity pattern, investigate the association between overstory canopy cover and RIFA captures, and evaluate the effects of low-intensity prescribed fire around pond edges on RIFA in the Lost Pines ecoregion of Texas, a region that provides habitat for most of the remaining endangered Houston toads Bufo houstonensis. We found that annual RIFA activity followed a quadratic curve, with above-average activity between May and October. We found an inverse relationship between mean percentage of canopy cover near pond edges and mean number of RIFA captured. We found that low-intensity prescribed burning had no significant influence on RIFA captures during our study period. However, strong spatial and temporal capture variability was apparent, and thus a strong impact would have been necessary to detect an effect. Although this study provides evidence that should decrease concerns that wildlife managers, conservation biologists, and landowners in the Lost Pines ecoregion may have about exacerbating RIFA abundance when using fire as an ecosystem management tool, we recommend additional work be conducted using a greater sample size, greater sampling effort, and longer study duration. We found that RIFA activity was highest during the time frame in which juvenile Houston toads emerge from ponds. Thus, RIFA control may be a useful Houston toad recovery tool where breeding ponds are not within dense canopy habitats.","http://meridian.allenpress.com/jfwm/article-pdf/3/1/142/2750765/012012-jfwm-010.pdf",""

The existing approaches for knowledge capture and organization in engineering are typically ad hoc in nature, which inhibit efficient knowledge sharing and deployment. The objective of this paper is to introduce a systematic methodology for knowledge capture, organization, and modeling in the manufacturing domain. The proposed methodology focuses on the conceptualization phase and utilizes Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) early in the process for creating a controlled vocabulary, or thesaurus, in the domain of interest. The resulting SKOS-based thesaurus is a lightweight ontology that helps identify the core concepts that will be translated into formal classes in an axiomatic ontology such as MSDL. The proposed methodology is discussed with the aid of examples from metal casting domain. Also, use of Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) for representation of constraint knowledge is discussed in this paper.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/DETC2012-71189/4256873/947_1.pdf",""

The focus on morning surveys is based on the reasonable assumption that detection is more likely when birds are most active. However, population surveys could become more time- and cost-efficient if both morning and evening sampling were equally effective, particularly for game birds, such as white-winged dove Zenaida asiatica. Texas Parks and Wildlife Department has recently implemented distance sampling to estimate population sizes and monitor an ongoing range expansion of this species. We compared morning vs. evening density estimates for white-winged doves sampled in Mason, Texas, on six separate occasions during summer 2006. Program DISTANCE (version 5.0) calculated similar detection probabilities and density estimates between paired morning and evening sampling periods. Probability of detection ranged from 0.27 to 0.46 for both morning and evening samples. Densities, in individuals/ha, ranged from 2.54 to 4.02 for morning sampling and 2.48 to 4.31 for evening sampling. In addition, variables (number of observations, cluster size, distance to cluster) used by DISTANCE did not vary substantially between morning and evening surveys. Our results suggest evening surveys are as effective as the conventional protocol of surveying white-winged doves only in the morning.

Towards this end, interest has been increasingly focusing on the use of sheet magnesium in the manufacture of panels and structural components by utilizing recent advances in twin-roll casting technology of magnesium. However, challenges in the areas of manufacturing, material processing and modeling need to be resolved in order to fully utilize magnesium alloys. Despite the limited formability of magnesium alloys at room temperature due to its hexagonal close-packed crystalline structure, studies have shown that the formability of magnesium alloys can be significantly improved by processing the material at elevated temperatures and by modifying the microstructure to increase ductility. Such improvements can potentially be achieved by processes such as superplastic forming and warm forming along with sheet manufacturing techniques such as Twin Roll Casting (TRC). In this work we investigate the superplastic behavior of twin-roll cast AZ31B through mechanical testing, microstructure characterization and modeling. The experimental results show that the as-received AZ31B sheet consists of relatively large gains, and while it is brittle at low temperature it is ductile at high temperature with activation energies of the deformation close to that of lattice diffusion. The material analyzed possesses medium strain-rate sensitivity of 0.27 with a relatively modest ductility of about 74%. Based on the experimental results, we use a physically-based constitutive model for deformation. The model integrates the main microstructural features, grain shape and grain orientations, within a self-consistent viscoplasticity theory with internal variables. Simulation of the deformation process at room temperature shows activity of the basal and prismatic systems at the early stages of deformation and increasing activity of pyramidal systems due to twinning. The predicted texture from the model is consistent with the experimental results. With the use of the appropriate model parameters, the stress strain relationship can be described accurately over the range of low strain rates.","",""

To address this issue, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) was performed to examine live cell interactions of Plin2 with lipids involved in maintaining lipid droplet structure and function. FRET efficiencies ( E) between CFP-labeled Plin2 and fluorescently labeled phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, stearic acid, and cholesterol were quantitated on a pixel-by-pixel basis to generate FRET image maps that specified areas with high E (>60%) in lipid droplets. The mean E and the distance R between the probes indicated a high yield of energy transfer and demonstrated molecular distances on the order of 44–57 Å, in keeping with direct molecular contact. In contrast, FRET between CFP-Plin2 and Nile red was not detected, indicating that the CFP-Plin2/Nile red interaction was beyond FRET proximity (>100 Å). An examination of the effect of Plin2 on cellular metabolism revealed that triacylglycerol, fatty acid, and cholesteryl ester content increased while diacylglycerol remained constant in CFP-Plin2-overexpressing cells. Total phospholipids also increased, reflecting increased phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin. Consistent with these results, expression levels of enzymes involved in triacylglycerol, cholesteryl ester, and phospholipid synthesis were significantly upregulated in CFP-Plin2-expressing cells while those associated with lipolysis either decreased or were unaffected. Taken together, these data show for the first time that Plin2 interacts directly with lipids on the surface of lipid droplets and influences levels of key enzymes and lipids involved in maintaining lipid droplet structure and function.","https://journals.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpcell.00448.2011",""

Results supported a causal pathway whereby stronger perceiver sexism predicted stronger negative affective evaluations of, and weaker empathic reactions toward, the JFP. Stronger negative affective evaluations and weaker empathic reactions, in turn, predicted stronger culpability attributions toward the JFP. Also, participants who were provided information about the JFP's extensive victimisation history and coercion into the trade, relative to participants who were not provided this information, attributed lesser culpability to the JFP. Finally, stronger culpability attributions toward the JFP related to weaker recommendations of restorative justice (i.e. counselling/mental health services for the JFP) and stronger recommendations of retributive justice (i.e. incarceration for the JFP).

The procedure used in the study also employs a “donut-shaped” perturbation zone, rather than the traditional “pancake-shaped” zone, when displacing a case.

The authors conclude that SARP geomasking using the distribution of actual street addresses protects privacy more effectively than geomasking based on population size; the different SARP techniques do not significantly change the clustering patterns on a global level, but the geomasked data tend to be more clustered than the real case distribution.","https://utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/carto.47.3.1112",""

Interspecific scaling relationships between body mass and gut capacity have consistently estimated a slope of 1.0; however, intraspecific scaling relationships between body mass and gut capacity have been highly variable. We examined the influence of demands of growth and production on scaling relationships of body mass and rumen–reticulum characteristics in white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus (Zimmermann, 1780)) because little is known about how juvenile and subadult ruminants accommodate increased digesta masses. We sampled 108 animals over a 2-year period and assessed the influence of body mass, time of kill, crude protein (%), and acid detergent fiber (%) in the rumen, lactation, sex, and back fat on rumen–reticulum organ mass, rumen–reticulum capacity, wet mass of the digesta, and the dry mass of the digesta. Juvenile and subadult white-tailed deer had rumen–reticulum organ masses, capacity, and digesta masses that were similar to adults because body mass and rumen–reticulum scaling relationships all had scalars similar to 1.0. Thus, under the confines of our study, ontogeny plays only a minor role in the physiological characteristics of the rumen–reticulum and the scaling relationships of body mass and rumen–reticulum capacity.","http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/full-xml/10.1139/cjz-2012-0122",""

The authors explore the feasibility of utilizing block group level census data to estimate the residential carbon footprint of an American city. A census-based emission model was adapted from the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s Individual Emission Calculator. Block group census data were used as surrogates for household energy consumption and transportation related carbon emissions. Although lacking some of the finer nuances of individual behavior assessments, this approach enables analysis of a continuous urban landscape with a relatively high degree of data resolution using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and standard desktop-software. The model output, paired with choropleth and dasymetric visualizations, illustrate that census data can be successfully adapted to estimate the residential carbon footprint for Austin, Texas, and by extension, any other American city with equivalent census data coverage.</p>","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=70661",""

The vertical shear variability over the main development region for Atlantic hurricanes is affected by local factors as well as by the remote influence of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, as indicated by observational and climate modeling analyses. Climate model simulations of the ENSO–shear relationship are compared with observations. It is shown that there is a strong influence of background mean flow on the ENSO–shear relationship, because of the inherently nonlinear nature of vertical wind shear. In particular, the simulation of zonal flow over the tropical Atlantic is shown to play a critical role in how the remote influence of ENSO modulates the shear. Even with realistic simulations of the ENSO-induced westerly anomaly in the upper troposphere, overestimated easterly background flow in the model simulations can alter the relationship between ENSO and vertical wind shear, resulting in decreased vertical wind shear during warm ENSO events. This nonlinear superposition has important implications for the assessment of trends in large-scale environmental factors affecting tropical cyclogenesis in climate change simulations.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jcli/article-pdf/25/3/858/3986609/jcli-d-11-00213_1.pdf",""

A careful placement of variables in memory is utilized to decrease the number of address arithmetic instructions and thus to generate compact and efficient code. The simple offset assignment (SOA) problem concerns the layout of variables for machines with one address register and the general offset assignment (GOA) deals with multiple address registers. Both these problems assume that each variable needs to be allocated for the entire duration of a program. Both SOA and GOA are NP-complete. In this article, we present effective heuristics for the simple and the general offset assignment problems with variable coalescing where two or more non-interfering variables can be mapped into the same memory location.

Recently, the overexpression of a β-galactoside binding protein, galectin-3 (LGALS3), has been correlated with metastatic melanoma in patients. We have previously shown that silencing galectin-3 in metastatic melanoma cells reduces tumor growth and metastasis. Gene expression profiling identified the protumorigenic gene autotaxin (ENPP2) to be downregulated after silencing galectin-3. Here we report that galectin-3 regulates autotaxin expression at the transcriptional level by modulating the expression of the transcription factor NFAT1 (NFATC2). Silencing galectin-3 reduced NFAT1 protein expression, which resulted in decreased autotaxin expression and activity. Reexpression of autotaxin in galectin-3 silenced melanoma cells rescues angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis in vivo. Silencing NFAT1 expression in metastatic melanoma cells inhibited tumor growth and metastatic capabilities in vivo. Our data elucidate a previously unidentified mechanism by which galectin-3 regulates autotaxin and assign a novel role for NFAT1 during melanoma progression.

Most current chip multiprocessor systems include multilevel TLBs and provide support for superpages both at the hardware and software level. Judicious use of superpages can significantly cut down the number of TLB misses and improve overall system performance. However, indiscriminate superpage allocation results in page fragmentation and increased application footprint, which often outweigh the benefits of reduced TLB misses. Previous research has explored policies for smart allocation of superpages from an operating system perspective. This paper presents a compiler‐based strategy for automatic and profitable memory allocation via superpages. A significant advantage of a compiler‐based approach is the availability of data‐reuse information within an application. Our strategy employs data‐locality analysis to estimate the TLB demands for both single‐threaded and multi‐threaded programs and uses this metric to apply selective superpage allocation. Apart from its obvious utility in improving TLB performance, this strategy can be used to improve the effectiveness of certain data‐layout transformations and can be a useful tool in benchmarking and automatic performance tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy with experiments on three multicore platforms on a workload that contains both sequential and parallel applications.

Second, we used repetitive sampling to study hormone secretion from GnRH-GFP transgenic rats in the homozygous, heterozygous, and wild-type state and between transgenic and Wistar males after ∼4 yr of backcrossing. Parameters of hormone secretion were not different between the three genetic groups or between transgenic males and Wistar controls. Finally, we performed long-term recording in as many GFP-identified GnRH neurons as possible in hypothalamic slices to determine their patterns of discharge. In some cases, we obtained GnRH neuronal recordings from individual males in which blood samples had been collected the previous day. Activity in individual GnRH neurons was expressed as total quiescence, a continuous pattern of firing of either low or relatively high frequencies or an intermittent pattern of firing. In males with both intensive blood sampling (at 6-min intervals) and recordings from their GnRH neurons, we analyzed the activity of GnRH neurons with intermittent activity above 2 Hz using cluster analysis on both data sets.

The Se hyperaccumulator Astragalus bisulcatus was collected in its natural seleniferous habitat, and x-ray fluorescence mapping and x-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy were used to characterize Se distribution and speciation in all organs as well as in encountered microbial symbionts and herbivores. Se was present at high levels (704–4,661 mg kg−1 dry weight) in all organs, mainly as organic C-Se-C compounds (i.e. Se bonded to two carbon atoms, e.g. methylselenocysteine). In nodule, root, and stem, up to 34% of Se was found as elemental Se, which was potentially due to microbial activity. In addition to a nitrogen-fixing symbiont, the plants harbored an endophytic fungus that produced elemental Se. Furthermore, two Se-resistant herbivorous moths were discovered on A. bisulcatus, one of which was parasitized by a wasp. Adult moths, larvae, and wasps all accumulated predominantly C-Se-C compounds. In conclusion, hyperaccumulators live in association with a variety of Se-resistant ecological partners. Among these partners, microbial endosymbionts may affect Se speciation in hyperaccumulators. Hyperaccumulators have been shown earlier to negatively affect Se-sensitive ecological partners while apparently offering a niche for Se-resistant partners. Through their positive and negative effects on different ecological partners, hyperaccumulators may influence species composition and Se cycling in seleniferous ecosystems.","http://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-pdf/159/4/1834/37158211/plphys_v159_4_1834.pdf",""

Formation of an aqueous phase in contact with hydrocarbon phases is inevitable in almost all recovery processes, because of the permanent presence of water in the reservoirs either as injection fluid or as initial formation water. Successful modeling of CO2 flooding requires accounting for the presence of four phases. However, as the number of phases increase, flash calculations become more difficult and time-consuming. A possible approach to reduce the computational time of the phase equilibrium calculations is to use reduced methods. This paper presents a general strategy to model the behavior of CO2/hydrocarbon/water systems where four equilibrium phases occur using a reduced flash approach. The speedup obtained by a reduced flash algorithm compared to the conventional flash approach is demonstrated for a different number of components and phases. The results show a significant speedup in the Jacobian matrix construction and in Newton-Raphson iterations using the reduced method when four phases are present. The computational advantage of the reduced method increases rapidly with the number of phases and components. The developed four-phase reduced flash algorithm is used to investigate the effect of introducing water on the phase behavior of two West Texas oil/CO2 mixtures. The results show significant changes in the phase splits and saturation pressures by adding water to these CO2/hydrocarbon systems.","http://onepetro.org/SPEIOR/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/154218-MS/1639072/spe-154218-ms.pdf",""

The growth of TiO2 was achieved using titanium isopropoxide and water as the coreactants at a substrate temperature of 250 °C. In situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis revealed that the ALD process did not induce Si–O bonding at the STO–Si interface. Slight improvement in crystallinity of the TiO2 film was achieved through in situ annealing under vacuum (10−9 Torr) at 450–600 °C. However, the amount of Si–O bonding increased following annealing at temperatures greater than 250 °C. X-ray diffraction revealed that TiO2 films annealed at a temperature of 250 °C in vacuum (10−9 Torr) for 1 h were the anatase phase and well crystallized. The results indicate that careful consideration of growth temperature and annealing conditions may allow epitaxial oxide films to be grown by ALD on STO-buffered Si(001) substrates without formation of an amorphous SiOx layer.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-pdf/doi/10.1116/1.4734311/16079301/04e111_1_online.pdf",""

Four unit cells of STO grown by MBE serve as the surface template for ALD growth. The STO films grown by ALD are crystalline as-deposited with minimal, if any, amorphous SiOx layer at the STO-Si interface. The growth of STO was achieved using bis(triisopropylcyclopentadienyl)-strontium, titanium tetraisopropoxide, and water as the coreactants at a substrate temperature of 250 °C. In situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis revealed that the ALD process did not induce additional Si–O bonding at the STO-Si interface. Postdeposition XPS analysis also revealed sporadic carbon incorporation in the as-deposited films. However, annealing at a temperature of 250 °C for 30 min in moderate to high vacuum (10−6–10−9 Torr) removed the carbon species. Higher annealing temperatures (&gt;275 °C) gave rise to a small increase in Si–O bonding, as indicated by XPS, but no reduced Ti species were observed. X-ray diffraction revealed that the as-deposited STO films were c-axis oriented and fully crystalline. A rocking curve around the STO(002) reflection gave a full width at half maximum of 0.30° ± 0.06° for film thicknesses ranging from 5 to 25 nm. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy revealed that the STO films were continuous with conformal growth to the substrate and smooth interfaces between the ALD- and MBE-grown STO. Overall, the results indicate that thick, crystalline STO can be grown on Si(001) substrates by ALD with minimal formation of an amorphous SiOx layer using a four-unit-cell STO buffer layer grown by MBE to serve as the surface template.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jva/article-pdf/doi/10.1116/1.4770291/16121392/01a136_1_online.pdf",""

The interruptions that we consider are not generated from within the group, but have their source outside the group. Emphasizing the theories of structural ritualization, relational cohesion, and productive exchange, we predict that interruptions that have positive, negative, or neutral effects on the group all cause problems with the resolution of routine. Methods: We design and conduct a four‐condition experiment to test our predictions. Results: There was more stability in group procedures when there was no interruption than when there was any kind of interruption. There were no differences in efficiency or activities between positive and negative interruptions. However, there were more agreements in positive interruption groups than in negative interruption groups. Additionally, group members’ perceptions varied by the type of interruption: those in positively interrupted groups reported higher levels of competence and feelings of success. Conclusions: We find that interruption, in and of itself, creates problems with resumption of group processes. Whether the interruption is positive or negative, however, does create interaction differences and differences in group members’ perceptions and affect related to the group and each other.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fj.1540-6237.2012.00879.x",""

Culturally knowledgeable and responsive teachers are important in early education and care settings that serve children from immigrant families. However, there is little research on immigrant teachers’ cultural and professional knowledge or on their political access to curricular/pedagogical decision-making. Focus of Study: This study is part of the larger Children Crossing Borders (CCB) study: a comparative study of what practitioners and parents who are recent immigrants in multiple countries think should happen in early education settings. Here, we present an analysis of the teacher interviews that our team conducted in the United States and compare the perspectives of immigrant teachers with those of their nonimmigrant counterparts, specifically centering on the cultural expertise of immigrant teachers who work within their own immigrant community. Research Design: The research method used in the CCB project is a variation of the multi-vocal ethnographic research method used in the two Preschool in Three Cultures studies. We made videotapes of typical days in classrooms for 4-year-olds in early childhood education and care (ECEC) settings in five countries (England, France, Germany, Italy, and the United States) and then used these videos as cues for focus group interviews with parents and teachers. Using a coding framework designed by the national CCB team, we coded 30 focus group interviews. The coding framework was designed to facilitate comparisons across countries, cities, and categories of participants (teachers and parents, immigrant and nonimmigrant). Findings/Results: Teachers who are themselves immigrants from the same communities of the children and families they serve seem perfectly positioned to bridge the cultural and linguistic worlds of home and school. However, our study of teachers in five U.S. cities at a number of early childhood settings suggests that teachers who are themselves immigrants often experience a dilemma that prevents them from applying their full expertise to the education and care of children of recent immigrants. Rather than feeling empowered by their bicultural, bilingual knowledge and their connection to multiple communities, many immigrant teachers instead report that they often feel stuck between their pedagogical training and their cultural knowledge. Conclusions/Recommendations: Bicultural, bilingual staff, and especially staff members who are themselves immigrants from the community served by the school, can play an invaluable role in parent–staff dialogues, but only if their knowledge is valued, enacted, and encouraged as an extension of their professional role as early childhood educators. For the teachers, classrooms, and structures in our study, this would require nonimmigrant practitioners to have a willingness to consider other cultural versions of early childhood pedagogy as having merit and to enter into dialogue with immigrant teachers and immigrant communities.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/016146811211401203",""

A regional hub infrastructure was established with specific cores: administration, training, bioinformatics, biospecimen/biobanking, community translation, emerging technologies, and ethical-legal-policy issues. Two survey tools were employed to identify regional resources, including biospecimen collection and sharing practices: the NCI-developed Readiness Assessment Tool (RAT) and a regional-specific online Comprehensive Needs Assessment (CNA). These tools demonstrated the absence of central institutional biospecimen records at our partner institutions. This observation prompted a qualitativepilot study to assess the attitudes and barriers of researchers in the region to sharing biospecimens and participating in a virtual national biorepository. Methods: An online survey tool was developed to assess general receptiveness toward biobanks, presumed usefulness of biobanks, and perceived attitudes and barriers in recruiting patients for biobanks. We identified investigators working directly and indirectly, or planning to work with human biospecimens at Region 4 institutions (AZ, CO, NM, OK, TX). Participants’ email addresses were obtained from a publically available NIH-funded database (NIH RePorter), and an email inviting them to participate was sent along with the secure link to access the survey online. Participants were followed up with reminder emails at 2 and 4 weeks to complete the survey. Results: The RAT and the CNA identified several challenges regarding biospecimen collections: few of the Region 4 participants utilize biospecimens routinely in their research; there are no central institutional biospecimen records, so resource listings are all ad hoc; lack of desire and trust by some ethnic groups to contribute to biospecimen research; biospecimens collection between institutions may have problems due to lack of trust between target populations; and certain collaborating institutions and some repositories fail to cooperate due to competition, territorial issues, and lack of communication. Results from the pilot study will help generate recommendations and hypotheses regarding biospecmien sharing and participation in a virtual national biorepository among the 485 Region 4 researchers. Identifying the barriers to sharing biospecimens and participating in a national virtual biorepository will in turn result in strengthening collaborative opportunities among researchers in the region through the sharing of biospecimen data collections.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/72/8_Supplement/5520/582605/Abstract-5520-How-widely-shared-are-institutional",""

To investigate this relationship over a longer period, the SLP fields were reconstructed back to 1470 based on a mathematical model and the historical precipitation indices of eastern China. A cross-validation test of independent samples suggests that the reconstructed SLPs are statistically acceptable. According to the first three predominant SVD modes of the SLP field, three SLP index series (SLPI1–SLPI3) were developed to quantify the thermodynamic differences among the critical SLP centers of East Asia. Both SLPI1 and SLPI2 are highly correlated with the East Asian summer monsoon index, whereas SLPI3 is related to the index of Eurasian meridional atmospheric circulation. The temporal scales of SLP indices were examined during 1470–2008 using the wavelet power spectra. Results indicate that there is significant variance at a 2–5-yr band in the power spectra of the three SLP indices, suggesting SLPI1–SLPI3 have evident interannual variability. Moreover, the wavelet power spectra of SLPI1 and SLPI2 show significantly higher power at the 8–12-yr scale from 1470 to 1750 and at the 60–90-yr scale after 1750. For SLPI3, besides the interannual variability, it has additional periodical variability of 6–11 and 23–33 yr.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jcli/article-pdf/25/16/5600/3984732/jcli-d-11-00298_1.pdf",""

Virtual constraints concept is employed and a target oriented trajectory planning procedure is proposed, which can generate periodic dynamic compatible and desired point crossing trajectory. A Lyapunov based tracking controller is proposed to avoid the strict conditions for using a traditional LQR based method.

If any kinematic or dynamic constraints are imposed on the arm, the CNS adapts to the changes by incorporating learning mechanism into the motion planning. This paper seeks to identify the modified motion planning strategies of the CNS when the elbow joint is constrained to move. We present an experimental protocol, where subjects perform point–to–point reaching tasks with a lightweight elbow brace to restrict the joint kinematics with a minimal effect on the arm dynamics. From the experimental observations, the human strategies on each aspect of motion planning (i.e. hand path geometry, speed of the motion, and the arm posture selection) are hypothesized. The hypothesized strategies are developed as models and compared with the experimental data. As a result, we found that the hand path follows the rhumb line on the constraint workspace while the speed profile preserves a bell–shape, which can be roughly approximated by the minimum jerk model. In addition, by comparing the joint contributions data with and without the elbow constraint, it is hypothesized that the CNS resolves the redundancy of the inverse kinematics problem by reducing the kinetic energy of the limbs.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2012-87763/4229988/483_1.pdf",""

In this research, we develop a newsvendor‐based decision model for this problem based on our experience in industry and a focal case study environment.

Our analytical results show that the software release policy with postrelease testing has several important advantages over the policy without postrelease testing. First, the total expected cost is lower. Second, even though the optimal time to release the software is shortened, the reliability of the software is improved throughout its lifecycle. Third, although the expected number of undetected bugs is higher at the time of release, the expected number of software failures in the field is reduced. We also analyze the impact of market uncertainty on the release policy and find that all our prior findings remain valid. Finally, we examine a comprehensive scenario where in addition to uncertain market opportunity cost, testing resources allocated to the focal project can change before the end of testing.

Several studies have shown higher postoperative CHD adjusted mortality in black and Hispanic children. Others noted that non–English-speaking language at home was associated with appointment noncompliance, which the parents attributed to misunderstanding and living too far from a health center. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of home distance to a cardiac center, or having a Latin American–born parent, on first-year mortality in infants with severe CHD. METHODS:: Infants with severe CHD, having an estimated first-year mortality &gt;25%, born 1996–2003, were identified from the Texas Birth Defects Registry and linked to state and national vital records. We examined the effects of defect type; birth weight; gestational age; extracardiac anomalies; infant gender; maternal race/ethnicity, marital status, and education; residence in a Texas county bordering Mexico; home distance to cardiac center; and parental birth country on first-year survival. RESULTS:: Overall first-year survival was 59.9%, and no race/ethnic differences were noted; however, survival was significantly (P &lt; .05) lower for Hispanic infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Neither home distance to a cardiac center nor parental birth country was related to first-year survival; however, survival was noted to be lower in Texas counties bordering Mexico, counties that have high rates of poverty. CONCLUSIONS:: Further studies are needed to determine if these disparities in survival of infants with severe CHD are attributable to delays in referral to a cardiac center.","https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-pdf/129/6/1118/1090482/peds_2011-3114.pdf",""

Many DSPs use irregular addressing modes where base-plus-offset mode is not supported. However, they often have Address Generation Units (AGUs) that can perform auto-increment/decrement address arithmetic instructions in parallel with Load/Store instructions. This feature can be utilized to reduce the number of explicit address arithmetic instructions and thus reduce the embedded application code size. This code size reduction is essential for this family of DSP as the code usually resides in the ROM and hence the code size directly translates into silicon area. An effective technique for optimized code generation is offset assignment. This is a well-used technique in the literature to decrease the code size by finding an offset assignment that can effectively utilize auto-increment/decrement. This problem is known as simple offset assignment when there is only one address register and as General Offset Assignment (GOA) for multiple available address registers. In this article, we present an optimal Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solution to the offset assignment problem with variable coalescing where more than one variable can share the same memory location. Variable permutation is also formulated to find the best access sequence to achieve the best offset assignment that decreases the code size the most. Experimental results on several benchmarks show the effectiveness of our variable permutation technique as well as the large improvement from the ILP-based solutions compared to heuristics.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2209291.2209301",""

Each cosmic layer possessed its own deities, and they were linked by an axis-mundi that could take the form of a world tree or mountain, or a temple or sacred fire.

Because the term “technical writing” or “technical writer” did not exist during the Middle Ages, accrediting female medieval scientific and medical writers as technical writers requires the application of modern thought and definition. Primarily known as a mystic and writer of poetry and music, Hildegard's technological and medical texts have slowly gained interest within the medical community. Her texts Physica and Causae Curae, written in the style of modern-day patient history and physicals, outline patient symptoms, causes and effects, preceded by a treatment plan. This article examines Hildegard von Bingen's medical works, identifying her as a scientific or medical technical writer within the same context from which scholars assign Chaucer the same title, and from which all medical and scientific writers of medical texts can be professionally accredited as technical communicator or writer.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2190/TW.42.4.d",""

The authors wanted to compare treatment with isoniazid and treatment with isoniazid and rifampin in the typical public health setting in a large diverse state and recover as much information as possible from a state database. Methods: Patients who received latent tuberculosis infection treatment were identified in the Texas Department of State Health Services database for the years 1995-2002. Treatment completion, adverse reactions, and disease development were recorded. Results were analyzed using logistic regression to predict disease development. Results: In sum, 50 578 patients received isoniazid, and 280 received isoniazid/rifampin. Sixty-one percent of the isoniazid group and 54% of the isoniazid/rifampin group completed treatment. Eighteen percent of the isoniazid/rifampin group possibly had adverse reactions and discontinued treatment; 3% of the isoniazid group discontinued therapy because of side effects. More than 70% of patients with adverse reactions in the isoniazid/rifampin group took the treatment for more than 4 months. Overall, 168 patients in the isoniazid group with a normal chest X-ray and a positive skin test developed tuberculosis during follow-up to 2008; no patients in the isoniazid/rifampin group who had a normal X-ray and completed chemoprophylaxis developed tuberculosis during follow-up. Conclusions: The isoniazid/rifampin regimen appears to be as effective as the isoniazid regimen. However, completion rates on combination therapy were slightly lower. This regimen needs more formal clinical study since it has the potential to decrease administrative costs and improve completion rates. In addition, state departments of health need to develop networks using community-based resources to reach patients and increase completion rates.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2150131912437936",""

Our study showed that glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) exhibited low mitochondrial respiration and high glycolytic activity. These GSCs were highly resistant to standard drugs such as carmustine and temozolomide (TMZ), but showed high sensitivity to a glycolytic inhibitor 3-bromo-2-oxopropionate-1-propyl ester (3-BrOP), especially under hypoxic conditions. We further showed that combination of 3-BrOP with carmustine but not with TMZ achieved a striking synergistic effect and effectively killed GSCs through a rapid depletion of cellular ATP and inhibition of carmustine-induced DNA repair. This drug combination significantly impaired the sphere-forming ability of GSCs in vitro and tumor formation in vivo, leading to increase in the overall survival of mice bearing orthotopic inoculation of GSCs. Further mechanistic study showed that 3-BrOP and carmustine inhibited glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and caused a severe energy crisis in GSCs. Our study suggests that GSCs are highly glycolytic and that certain drug combination strategies can be used to effectively overcome their drug resistance based on their metabolic properties.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/stem.1273",""

Governance structure is a well-understood knowledge protection strategy designed to reduce knowledge leakage concerns and thereby encourage desired knowledge transfers in two-party R&D alliances. Whether governance structure can be an important balancing mechanism for R&D alliances with multiple partner firms, or multilateral R&D alliances, however, requires further study. Because increasing the number of alliance partners introduces additional complexities to managing an alliance, the appropriate governance mechanism for a multilateral R&D alliance is likely to differ from that for a bilateral alliance. Drawing insights from social exchange theory, we explore governance decisions in multilateral R&D alliances. First, we examine the potential for variance between multilateral and bilateral R&D alliances in governance decisions as a means of knowledge sharing and knowledge protection. Results based on our analysis of 2,423 R&D alliances, 1,690 bilateral and 733 multilateral, are consistent with predictions drawn from social exchange theory. We next focus on three-partner R&D alliances, or trilateral R&D alliances, and compare governance mechanisms between two types of trilateral R&D alliances: chain and net. We find that equity governance structures are more likely to be used in net-based than in chain-based trilateral R&D alliances; we also find that alliance scope moderates the relationship between the type of alliance and governance structure. Finally, we find that multilateral R&D alliances with predicted (aligned) governance structures perform better, in terms of alliance longevity, than those with misaligned structures.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/orsc.1110.0671",""

Several studies indicate that mTOR signaling is activated by UVB and may play an important role in skin tumorigenesis. mTOR exists in two functionally and compositionally distinct protein complexes: the rapamycin-sensitive mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and the rapamycin-resistant mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). The purpose of these studies was to investigate the roles of the two mTOR complexes in UVB-mediated proliferation and apoptosis in the skin. We used rapamycin, a pharmacologic inhibitor of mTORC1, and an inducible mTOR-deficient (K5-CreERT2;mTORfl/fl) mouse model that allows epidermal-specific disruption of mTOR following topical treatment with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT). Rapamycin blocked UVB-induced phosphorylation of S6K, the downstream target of mTORC1, and significantly reduced UVB-stimulated epidermal proliferation and cell-cycle progression, but had no effect on cell death. In contrast, mTOR deletion, which attenuated UVB-induced phosphorylation of both S6K and the mTORC2 target AKTSer473, significantly increased apoptosis both in vivo and in keratinocyte cultures, in addition to reducing hyperproliferation following UVB irradiation. The role of mTORC2 in UVB-induced prosurvival signaling was verified in Rictor−/− mouse embryo fibroblasts, which lack functional mTORC2 and were more sensitive to UVB-induced apoptosis than controls. These studies show that mTORC1 and mTORC2 play unique but complementary roles in controlling proliferation and apoptosis in the skin. Our findings underscore the importance of both mTOR complexes in mediating UVB-induced signaling in keratinocytes and provide new insight into the pathogenesis of skin cancer.

This “satisfaction paradox” has been attributed to psychological accommodation to poor financial circumstances and lower expectations.

Missing is an understanding of whether feeling economically secure is associated with physical, mental, and/or psychological well-being and whether it varies by institutionalization status. This study examined data from 152 centenarians who participated in the first wave of the Iowa Centenarian Study. Analyses examined six perceived economic status variables (sufficiency of financial resources, ability to meet expenses, finances compared to others, meeting needs, ability to purchase extras, and having enough money for the future) and measures derived from activities of daily living, the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (Pfeiffer, 1975) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (Yesavage, Brink, Rose, Lum, Huang, Adey, et al., 1983). Findings indicated that most centenarians do not feel able to handle their finances, yet believe that they are doing relatively well financially. Perceived economic status was positively associated with ability to complete daily living activities, cognitive ability, and psychological well-being with results differing by institutional status.

Defects in telomerase result in abnormally short telomeres in somatic cells, leading to early cell senescence, chemosensitivity, and susceptibility to genomic instability. Germline telomerase mutations are associated with a spectrum of disorders including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, familial liver disease, aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and dyskeratosis congenita, which confers a 90% lifetime risk for bone marrow failure, a 200-fold risk for AML, and a 2500-fold risk for MDS. These disorders have a variable clinical phenotype, but pronounced telomere shortening is a universal finding. Of note, enrichment of specific telomerase variants is observed in adults with hematologic malignancies. Our goal is to investigate the role of germline telomerase variants in pediatric AML development and treatment-related toxicities. We hypothesize that deleterious germline telomerase variants occur in children with AML and are associated with a telomere biology disorder phenotype. Exposure to chemotherapy and/or transplant may accelerate telomere shortening and manifestation of disease phenotype in affected individuals. Methods:: This exploratory analysis will determine (1) the frequency of germline telomerase variants in our local pediatric AML population (2) the implication of these variants on telomerase function, and (3) whether variants are associated with a telomere biology disorder phenotype. We are sequencing the exons and flanking intronic regions of four telomerase-related genes, TERT, DKC1, TERC, and TINF2, in germline pediatric AML samples (n=100), and functionally characterizing all novel variants. We are reviewing all cases blinded to telomerase variant status for clinical evidence characteristic of a telomere biology disorder. Results:: To date, out of the first 88 subjects sequenced, 12 constitutional heterozygous variants resulting in missense changes or deletions were found in 19 subjects (21.6%). Of the variants found, 7 are novel, and several represent rare variants observed in adult populations with hematologic malignancies. Among the 62 subjects that have undergone blinded chart review, clinical characteristics of telomere biology disorders were noted in subjects both with and without variants. In subjects with variants, the most predictive characteristics were (1) nail dysplasia, skin hyperpigmentation, and oral leukoplakia, (2) persistent liver or pulmonary disease of unknown etiology, and (3) delays in chemotherapy of more than 2 months due to cytopenias. Conclusion:: Presence of deleterious telomerase variants may be susceptibility loci in pediatric AML. Our results suggest that further investigation of the disease phenotypes associated with these variants is warranted.

We used radio-telemetry to monitor annual and seasonal survival of 34 female elk Cervus elaphus at Fort Riley, Kansas in a 3.5-y field study (November 2003 to February 2007). We modeled the relationship between individual and environmental covariates and survival rates of female elk. We observed eight mortalities, and harvest was the primary cause of mortality in our study population. Annual survival rates of female elk in Kansas (0.76) were similar to other harvested populations of elk. Among the candidate model set, models that included age as a covariate were most supported. Parameter estimates from top models provided support for a slight negative relationship between age and survival. Monthly survival estimates during hunting season declined with age from 0.98 for 1.5-y-old females to 0.80 for 16.5-y-old females.","http://meridian.allenpress.com/jfwm/article-pdf/3/2/199/2751087/082011-jfwm-050.pdf",""

Ovarian progesterone induces and PG and IFNT stimulates endometrial HSD11B1 expression and keto-reductase activity as well as many epithelial genes that govern trophectoderm proliferation, migration, and attachment during elongation. The primary aim of these studies was to test the hypothesis that HSD11B1-derived cortisol has a biological role in endometrial function and conceptus development during early pregnancy in sheep. In study 1, cyclic ewes received vehicle, cortisol, PF 915275 (PF; a selective inhibitor of HSD11B1), cortisol and PF, meloxicam (a selective inhibitor of PTGS2), cortisol and meloxicam, recombinant ovine IFNT, or IFNT and PF into the uterus from day 10 to day14 after estrus. Cortisol and IFNT stimulated endometrial HSD11B1 expression and activity, increased endometrial PTGS2 activity and the amount of PG in the uterine lumen, and up-regulated many conceptus elongation-related genes in the endometrium. Some effects of cortisol and IFNT were mediated by PTGS2-derived PG. In study 2, bred ewes received PF 915275 or recombinant ovine IFNT and into the uterus from day 10 to day 14 after mating. Inhibition of HSD11B1 activity in utero prevented conceptus elongation, whereas IFNT rescued conceptus elongation in PF-infused ewes. These results suggest that HSD11B1-derived cortisol mediates, in part, actions of ovarian progesterone and the conceptus on endometrial function and support the hypothesis that IFNT, PG, and cortisol coordinately regulate endometrial functions important for conceptus elongation and implantation during early pregnancy in sheep.","http://academic.oup.com/endo/article-pdf/154/2/931/8983437/endo0931.pdf",""

We illustrate some of the ways these limitations show up in theoretical psychology critiques and suggest that philosophical hermeneutics and the ideas of Mikhail Bakhtin present a fuller and more balanced picture of human agency without diluting the crucial insights conveyed by Levinas’s insistence on “ethics as first philosophy.”","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0959354310389647",""

Method: The sample consisted of 9665 students (73% women; mean age 20.31) from 30 colleges and universities from around the United States. Cross‐sectional data were gathered through a confidential online survey. Results: Across groups, PD and ethnic identity levels varied, while identity confusion levels were mostly similar. Neither identity confusion nor ethnic identity moderated the PD‐DS relationship for any groups. However, identity confusion was a partial mediator for immigrant and nonimmigrant Hispanic/Latino(a) and White/European American participants. Identity confusion also suppressed the PD‐DS relationship for Black/African American participants. Conclusions: Results highlight the need for additional research on identity confusion's role in the PD‐distress link and the importance of addressing ethnicity and generation status when examining the effects of PD on college students’ mental health.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fjclp.21936",""

Under some natural assumptions on the subgroup G and on the flags, one can pass from the filtered objects to the corresponding graded objects and describe the construction of canonical bundles of moving frames for these curves in the language of pure linear algebra. The scope of applicability of the theory includes geometry of natural classes of curves of flags with respect to reductive linear groups or their parabolic subgroups. As simplest examples, this includes the projective and affine geometry of curves.

All three groups of immigrants experienced significant changes in their health-seeking behaviors, but in different ways. Koreans experienced a dramatic decrease in seeking both primary and preventive health care after immigration, whereas Filipinos and Marshallese increased their health-seeking behaviors. Coupled with the previous health care experiences in their home country and individual characteristics, the social context of the host country, to a great degree, influenced the formation of health-seeking behaviors after immigration.

The proposed dependent decision tree model allows multiple dependent uncertainties with arbitrary marginal distributions to be represented in a decision tree with a sequence of conditional probability distributions. This general framework could be naturally applied in decision analysis and real options valuations, as well as in more general applications of dependent probability trees. While this approach to modeling dependencies can be based on several popular copula families as we illustrate, we focus on the use of the normal copula and present an efficient computational method for multivariate decision and risk analysis that can be standardized for convenient application.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/opre.1110.1004",""

A battery of standardized tests is being developed for these design skills. This paper focuses only on the divergent thinking test. This particular test has been given to over 500 engineering students and a smaller number of practicing engineers. It is designed to evaluate four direct measures (fluency, flexibility, originality, and quality) and four indirect measures (abstractability, afixability, detailability, and decomplexability). The eight questions on the test overlap in some measures and the responses can be used to evaluate several measures independently (e.g., fluency and originality can be evaluated separately from the same idea set). The data on the twenty-three measured variables were factor analyzed using both exploratory and confirmatory procedures. A four-factor solution with correlated (oblique) factors was deemed the best available solution after examining solutions with more factors. The indirect measures did not appear to correlate strongly either among themselves or with the other direct measures. The four-factor structure was then taken into a confirmatory factor analytic procedure that adjusted for the missing data. It was found to provide a reasonable fit. Estimated correlations among the four factors (F) ranged from a high of 0.32 for F1 and F2 to a low of 0.06 for F3 and F4.

They play an important role in terrestrial-sediment fluxes, landscape evolution, and the dynamics of riverine ecosystems. Meandering rivers have been of fundamental interest to researchers across a wide range of disciplines, from fluvial geomorphology to fluid mechanics, from river engineering to landscape ecology, owing to the intriguing complexity of meander morphodynamics. This interest also comes from the socio-economic concerns due to the river hazards caused by bank erosion, channel change, and flooding, as well as the adverse responses of meandering rivers to human- and climate-induced changes in the environmental conditions. An in-depth, process-based understanding of the dynamics of meandering river–floodplain systems is critical in order to investigate the responses of these systems to the changes in environmental conditions. Over the last few decades, there have been significant advances in river meandering research, with contributions from both theoretical modeling and experimental and field-based research. This paper presents a detailed overview of river meandering research, particularly focusing on the advances in the process-based understanding of meander morphodynamics. It also discusses the standing challenges in addressing the dynamics of real meandering rivers and their floodplain patterns and processes, and potential future directions in river meandering research. The paper advocates the crucial need for bridging theoretical modeling with field- and laboratory-based research in order to inform accurate assessments of river-hazard risks and facilitate ecologically sound river-management and restoration practices with the aim of supporting healthy ecosystems.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0309133312451989",""

However, phase transformation of such materials can be achieved only at extreme pressure–temperature conditions, which is irrelevant to industrial applications. Here, the phase transition from disordered nanocrystalline hexagonal (h)BN to superhard wurtzitic (w)BN was found at room temperature under a pressure of 6.7 GPa after applying large plastic shear in a rotational diamond anvil cell (RDAC) monitored by in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. However, under hydrostatic compression to 52.8 GPa, the same hBN sample did not transform to wBN but probably underwent a reversible transformation to a high-pressure disordered phase with closed-packed buckled layers. The current phase-transition pressure is the lowest among all reported direct-phase transitions from hBN to wBN at room temperature. Usually, large plastic straining leads to disordering and amorphization; here, in contrast, highly disordered hBN transformed to crystalline wBN. The mechanisms of strain-induced phase transformation and the reasons for such a low transformation pressure are discussed. Our results demonstrate a potential of low pressure–room temperature synthesis of superhard materials under plastic shear from disordered or amorphous precursors.

Many studies focus on animal models of hypertension; however, this does not necessarily extrapolate to humans. Current technology and cost limitations are prohibitive in fully evaluating hypertension within humans. Thus, we have designed a single-array platform that allows direct comparison of genes relevant to hypertension in animal models and non-human primates/human hypertension. The custom array is targeted to 328 genes known to be potentially related to blood pressure control. Studies compared gene expression in the kidney from normotensive rats and baboons. We found 74 genes expressed in both the rat and baboon kidney, 41 genes expressed in the rat kidney that were not detected in the baboon kidney and 34 genes expressed in the baboon kidney that were not detected in the rat kidney. To begin the evaluation of the array in a pathological condition, kidney gene expression was compared between the salt-sensitive deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) rat model of hypertension and sham animals. Gene expression in the renal cortex and medulla from hypertensive DOCA compared with sham rats revealed three genes differentially expressed in the renal cortex: annexin A1 (up-regulated; relative intensity: 1.316 ± 0.321 versus 2.312 ± 0.283), glutamate-cysteine ligase (down-regulated; relative intensity: 3.738 ± 0.174 versus 2.645 ± 0.364) and glutathione- S transferase (down-regulated; relative intensity: 5.572 ± 0.246 versus 4.215 ± 0.411) and 21 genes differentially expressed in the renal medulla.

Using MARY-X, a human breast cancer xenograft that exhibits florid lymphovascular emboli in mice and spheroids in vitro, we established a model where the in vitro transition stages from minced tumoral aggregates to well-formed spheroids served as a surrogate for in vivo emboli formation. MARY-X well-formed spheroids and emboli exhibited strong similarity of expression. The aggregate-to-spheroid transition stages were characterized by increased ExoC5, decreased Hgs and Rab7, increased calpains, increased full-length E-cadherin (E-cad/FL), and the transient appearance of E-cad/NTF2, a 95 kDa E-cadherin fragment and increased Notch3icd (N3icd), the latter two fragments produced by increased γ-secretase. Both transient and permanent knockdowns of Rab7 in MCF-7 cells increased protein but not transcription of E-cad/FL and resulted in the de novo appearance of E-cad/NTF2, the presence of nuclear E-cad/CTF2, and increased Notch1icd (N1icd). Overexpression of Rab7 conversely decreased E-cad/FL, γ-secretase (PS1/NTF), and E-cad/NTF2. Overexpression of calpains did not alter PS1/NTF but decreased E-cad/FL and E-cad/NTF2 and increased N1icd. Well-formed spheroids showed increased Rab7, absent E-cad/NTF2, decreased PS1/NTF, increased E-cad/NTF1, and increased N3icd, the latter two fragments being the direct and indirect consequences, respectively, of increased calpains (calpain 1 and calpain 2). Inhibition of calpains decreased E-cad/NTF1 but increased E-cad/NTF2 showing that calpains compete with γ-secretase (PS1) for closely located cleavage/binding sites on E-cadherin and that increased calpains can shuttle even decreased levels of γ-secretase to Notch 3, resulting in increased Notch 3 signaling in the well-formed spheroids.

Review of the literature reveals a lack of instruments that measure adolescents' perceptions of supportive nursing behaviours when initiating breastfeeding. Method: An instrument development and psychometric evaluation study was conducted. In phase 1, scale items were developed from the literature using social support theory. Eight lactation consultants evaluated the scale's content validity in phase 2. During phase 3, the psychometric properties of the scale were tested using item analysis, scale reliability, and exploratory factor analysis. A convenience sample of 101 adolescents, aged 15–20 years old, was recruited during their postpartum stay at three hospitals in the USA between July 2009–July 2010. Results: Content validity index was 0·82. Alpha estimate of internal consistency was 0·83. Principal components analysis resulted in a 3 factor scale that explained 48% of the total variance: Practical support, Informational support and Miscellaneous. Conclusion: The findings suggest evidence of the scale's adequate internal consistency. The factor analysis suggests two clear underlying dimensions of support: instrumental/emotional/appraisal and informational/emotional/appraisal, and a third miscellaneous dimension related to immediate skin‐to‐skin care and mothers' support persons. Further exploration of the possible global implications of the scale's dimensions is needed.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fj.1365-2648.2012.06119.x",""

A key aspect of a counterfactual's functionality is that insight about past mistakes is converted into plans for future action, thereby improving self‐regulatory success. If counterfactual thinking is a self‐regulatory tool, then it should be similarly impacted by psychological mechanisms that influence peoples' ability to improve future outcomes. The current research tested one such mechanism, psychological distance. Using a sequential priming paradigm, Experiment 1 showed that functional counterfactual thinking is sensitive to changes in temporal distance. Negative events in the recent versus distant past facilitated relevant behavioral intention judgments. Additionally, functional counterfactual thinking was sensitive to changes in the relevant behavioral intention's temporal distance, such that counterfactual judgments facilitated behavioral intentions set to occur in the near but not distant future (Experiment 2). Together, this research creates new connections between functional counterfactual thinking and psychological distance.

Rather than using a dichotomous dependent variable of “use” or “not use,” we use an index of four strategic planning activities to represent the extent of strategic planning use. We test our multivariate model using ordered logit and data collected from a 2005 survey of Florida city managers, mayors and chief administrative officers. We find support for all four of the major theoretical factors in our model. More strategic cities are more likely to be council manager cities, heterogeneous in population, depend less on sales tax revenue, have risk-taking leadership, use more contracting out, and have staff who participate in professional networks.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0275074012445308",""

Male C57BL6/J mice were fed normal (11 kcal% fat) or high-fat (58 kcal% fat) diets for 16 wk. Renal changes were evaluated by histochemistry and immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis, ELISA, enzymatic assays, and chemiluminometry. High-fat diet consumption led to increased body and kidney weights, impaired glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinemia, polyuria, a 2.7-fold increase in 24-h urinary albumin excretion, 20% increase in renal glomerular volume, 18% increase in renal collagen deposition, and 8% drop of glomerular podocytes. It also resulted in a 5.3-fold increase in urinary 8-isoprostane excretion and a 38% increase in renal cortex 4-hydroxynonenal adduct accumulation. 4-hydroxynonenal adduct level and immunoreactivity or Sirtuin 1 expression in renal medulla were not affected. Studies of potential mechanisms of the high-fat diet induced renal cortex oxidative injury revealed that whereas nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduced form oxidase activity only tended to increase, 12/15-lipoxygenase was significantly up-regulated, with approximately 12% increase in the enzyme protein expression and approximately 2-fold accumulation of 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, a marker of 12/15-lipoxygenase activity. Accumulation of periodic acid-Schiff -positive material, concentrations of TGF-β, sorbitol pathway intermediates, and expression of nephrin, CAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein, phosphoeukaryotic initiation factor-α, and total eukaryotic initiation factor-α in the renal cortex were indistinguishable between experimental groups. Vascular endothelial growth factor concentrations were reduced in high-fat diet fed mice. In conclusion, systemic and renal cortex oxidative stress associated with 12/15-lipoxygenase overexpression and activation is an early phenomenon caused by high-calorie/high-fat diet consumption and a likely contributor to kidney disease associated with prediabetes and alimentary obesity.","http://academic.oup.com/endo/article-pdf/153/3/1152/10387605/endo1152.pdf",""

When games are collaborative – that is, a game requires that players work in joint pursuit of a shared goal -- the computational thinking is easily observed as distributed across several participants. This raises the possibility that a focus on such board games are profitable for those who wish to understand computational thinking and learning in situ. This paper introduces a coding scheme, applies it to the recorded discourse of three groups of game players, and provides qualitative examples of computational thinking that are observed and documented in Pandemic. The primary contributions of this work are the description of and evidence that complex computational thinking can develop spontaneously during board game play.","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=70203",""

Results indicated that education about public policy issues influenced students’ attitudes toward the death penalty, prison reform, and the insanity defense.

Findings based on original data collected from a sample of mother–offspring dyads show that differences in parenting styles play an important moderating role in the variable transmission of parental political values.

This trend calls into question conventional wisdom and prior research that suggest a causal, positive relationship between foreclosures and crime. The objective of this article is to consider an alternative argument, that foreclosures and crime are part‐and‐parcel of the same community‐level dynamics, and thus are not causally related. Methods: We use random effects models to analyze community crime and foreclosure data from Chicago between 2004 and 2009. Results: Findings reveal that crime and foreclosures are spuriously related; controlling for confounding factors such as concentrated disadvantage and the political hierarchy of communities renders the foreclosure‐crime association nonsignificant. Conclusion: Foreclosures and crime are each explained by antecedent community characteristics. To understand why social problems are unevenly distributed across geographic space, it is necessary to investigate why power and political influence are unevenly distributed.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fj.1540-6237.2012.00891.x",""

We used a systems biology approach to investigate in male rats the interaction of the ancestral modifications carried transgenerationally in the germ line and the proximate modifications involving chronic restraint stress during adolescence. We find that a single exposure to a common-use fungicide (vinclozolin) three generations removed alters the physiology, behavior, metabolic activity, and transcriptome in discrete brain nuclei in descendant males, causing them to respond differently to chronic restraint stress. This alteration of baseline brain development promotes a change in neural genomic activity that correlates with changes in physiology and behavior, revealing the interaction of genetics, environment, and epigenetic transgenerational inheritance in the shaping of the adult phenotype. This is an important demonstration in an animal that ancestral exposure to an environmental compound modifies how descendants of these progenitor individuals perceive and respond to a stress challenge experienced during their own life history.","https://pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.1118514109",""

With the essential objective of quantifying the additional investments necessary for efficient year-round transportation of oil while providing travelers with acceptable roadway service, the study focused on roads owned or maintained by local governments, e.g., counties and townships. Impacts and funding needs were analyzed for three types of roads: paved, gravel, and graded and drained. The analysis was based on three main data sources: oil production forecasts, traffic data, and county road surveys. The forecast output of wells was routed over the road network to pipelines, with a detailed geographic information system model in which oil movements were represented as equivalent tractor–semitrailer trips that follow least-cost paths. The projected inputs of sand and water and the outbound movements of salt water to disposal sites were similarly routed. These predicted inbound and outbound movements were accumulated for each impacted segment. Movements of specialized equipment were included in the analysis.

The UB3LYP/6-31G* method was found to give representative energies for the reactive system and was used as a model for the simulations. UB3LYP/6-31G* direct dynamics trajectories were initiated at the TS connecting the ·O–O–CH2–CH2· biradical and dioxetane by sampling the TS's vibrational energy levels, and rotational and reaction coordinate energies, with Boltzmann distributions at 300, 1000, and 1500 K. This corresponds to the transition state theory model for trajectories that pass the TS. The trajectories were directed randomly towards both the biradical and dioxetane. A small fraction of the trajectories directed towards the biradical recrossed the TS and formed dioxetane. The remainder formed 1O2 + C2H4 and of these ∼ 40% went directly from the TS to 1O2 + C2H4 without getting trapped and forming an intermediate in the ·O–O–CH2–CH2· biradical potential energy minimum, a non-statistical result. The dioxetane molecules which are formed dissociate to two formaldehyde molecules with a rate constant two orders of magnitude smaller than that predicted by Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus theory.

The Kalman filter theory is introduced where the linear Kalman filter and the unscnted Kalman filter algorithms are explained. An example of estimating the dynamics of a simply supported beam, modeled using the finite element method, is first discussed for the purpose of establishing the effectiveness of the Kalman filtering approach in dynamic structural systems. A more complicated system consisting of a flexible appendage attached at one end to a rotating hub is then introduced. The system dynamics are modeled using the finite element method, which is incorporated in a computer simulation where the Kalman filter is applied to estimate not only the appendage dynamics, but its parameters as well; specifically its natural frequency. The purpose of the work is to establish a practical method of acquiring the natural frequency for a flexible structure to accommodate a structural health monitoring system. Results show that the Kalman filter is a viable option for estimating the natural frequency of flexible structure.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2012-88720/4261966/461_1.pdf",""

Practicing designers recognize the existence of risk and commonly are aware of events that raise risk levels. However, a disconnect exists between past project performance and current project execution that limits decision-making. This disconnect is primarily due to a lack of quantitative models that can be used for rational decision-making. Methods and tools used to make decisions in risk-informed design generally use an expected value approach. Research in the psychology domain has shown that decision-makers and stakeholders have domain-specific risk attitudes that often have variations between individuals and between companies. Risk methods used in engineering such as Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA), Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), and others are often ill-equipped to help stakeholders make decisions based upon risk-tolerant or risk-averse decision-making conditions. This paper focuses on the specific issue of helping stakeholders make decisions under risk-tolerant or risk-averse decision-making conditions and presents a novel method of translating engineering risk data from the domain of expected value into a domain corrected for risk attitude. This is done by using risk utility functions derived from the Engineering-Domain-Specific Risk-Taking (E-DOSPERT) test. This method allows decisions to be made based upon data that is risk attitude corrected. Further, the method uses an aspirational measure of risk attitude as opposed to existing lottery methods of generating utility functions that are based upon past performance. An illustrative test case using a simplified space mission designed in a collaborative design center environment is included. The method is shown to change risk-informed decisions in certain situations where a risk-tolerant or risk-averse decision-maker would likely choose differently than the dictates of the expected value approach.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/DETC2012-70399/4253156/693_1.pdf",""

The existing methods either collect risk information following the completion of a conceptual design thus treating risk as an afterthought during trade studies, make risk-informed decisions prior to the conduction of trade studies thus artificially constraining the design space, or do not consider risk at all. This paper proposes a risk-informed decision making framework that offers a new, meaningful way of accounting for risk during trade studies, informs design decisions during trade studies with pertinent risk information, and takes into account risk attitude of the design engineer or customer when risk-informed decisions are made. Risk is elevated to the same level of importance as other system level variables in trade studies and risk-based decisions are made by individual subsystem engineers through the lens of risk appetite. Several previously developed methods of risk trading, assessing engineering risk attitude, and making risk-informed decisions based upon engineering risk attitude using utility theory are synthesized into the risk-informed decision-making framework. Implementation methods for trade studies being performed by groups of people and automatically by computers are presented. Sensitivity of the framework to input variable variation is examined. A spacecraft example is employed to demonstrate the usefulness of the framework. This paper provides a novel framework for risk-informed design decisions made within trade studies that are based upon engineering risk attitudes in early phase conceptual design.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2012-89639/4512013/1777_1.pdf",""

Forty‐six families reported on the number of infant night wakings at 7, 12, and 14 months of age. Attachment was measured at 12 (infant–mother) and 14 (infant–father) months. Findings suggest that infants with a secure (including the dependent‐secure, B4) pattern of attachment with mothers decreased in the number of night wakings over time, whereas infants with an insecure‐resistant pattern of attachment with mothers continued to wake at night into the second year. Attachment dependency did not account for differences in night waking. These findings are important to understanding the mechanism(s) underlying the relation between attachment and sleep–wake regulation.

The purpose of the synthesis is (1) to provide information on how and how well auditors perform the task, which serves as feedback to the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board on implementation issues and problems related to auditors' application of the professional standards on ICOFR; and (2) to identify gaps in the current literature and fruitful areas of future research. Consistent with Auditing Standard No. 5, we delineate five phases of the ICOFR audit: (1) planning; (2) scoping; (3) testing; (4) evaluation; and (5) reporting. We structure our synthesis using a framework that classifies the determinants of performance in each phase into five broad areas: (a) the auditor's attributes, (b) the client's attributes, (c) the interaction between the auditor and the client, (d) task attributes, and (e) environmental attributes. Key contributions include providing an ICOFR tasks taxonomy, proposing a model of the determinants of performance for each task, evaluating auditors' performance of the tasks in our taxonomy, highlighting findings and gaps of importance to regulators, and providing a road map for future research.","https://publications.aaahq.org/ajpt/article-pdf/32/Supplement%201/131/48262/ajpt-50345.pdf",""

Two cases in which a predecessor rain event (PRE) occurred ahead of the recurving TC—Erin (2007) and Ike (2008)—are analyzed, with ensemble members correctly predicting TC recurvature contrasted from those predicting the TC to weaken or turn southward. This analysis demonstrates that TC-related moisture transport can increase the total water vapor in the atmosphere over North America by 20 mm or more, and that the moisture transport takes place both in the boundary layer and aloft. The increased moisture does not always correspond to increased rainfall in the ensemble forecasts, however, as the location and strength of baroclinic zones and their attendant secondary circulations that can lift this moist air are also crucial to the development of heavy rains.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/mwr/article-pdf/140/6/1810/4273029/mwr-d-11-00307_1.pdf",""

Method: Participants were 44 school-age children who were divided evenly into four groups, depending on their age (older, younger) and fluency status (CWS, CWNS). Children conversed with an examiner about a series of pictures and then told a story about the same pictures. Results: School-age CWS produced more instances of atypical (stuttering-like) disfluencies in the narrative context than in the conversational context. Younger school-age children produced more instances of typical (nonstuttering-like) disfluencies in the conversational sample than did older school-age children. Age did not affect the frequency of children’s stuttering-like disfluencies in either the conversational or the narrative contexts. Clinical Implications: These findings suggest that narration may offer a relatively efficient way of eliciting stuttering-like disfluencies during the assessment of stuttering. Thus, when assessing children to determine if they do or do not stutter, this type of sample should be considered in addition to the standard conversational sample.","http://pubs.asha.org/doi/pdf/10.1044/0161-1461%282011/10-0068%29",""

The structural equation modeling approach was mainly used based on the model comparison between the full research model and the controlled model. The results indicate that an organization’s procedural justice positively affects both variables of transformational leadership and employees’ citizenship behaviors whereas the transformational leadership also positively affects employees’ citizenship behaviors. The model comparison based on chi-square differences indicates that transformational leadership plays the role of a partial mediating variable to explain the relationship between the organization’s procedural justice and employees’ citizenship behaviors.

The occurrence of sulfate or gypsum deposits in these soils is unpredictable and often localized in small areas. Current testing procedures, in which samples are collected at specified intervals for sulfate measurements, often miss these localized concentrations. A method that provides rapid and continuous mapping of sulfate content in subgrades to a depth of at least 1 m is needed. Researchers in precision agriculture have used several devices that rapidly and continuously measure the bulk electrical conductivity of the soil at high spatial resolutions (<10 ft) and depths (≥2 ft). For the research described in this paper, the Veris 3150 was used to measure spatial variability in bulk electrical conductivity across three sulfate-bearing subgrades in Texas. The data were used to construct high-resolution maps of the subgrade conductivity and were compared with soil properties to identify potentially high-risk areas for sulfate heaving. The bulk electrical conductivity, the sulfate content, and the soil plasticity varied in tandem throughout the subgrades. This research identified areas with an electrical conductivity of >100 mS/m as having the greatest potential for sulfate problems of the subgrades tested. It also identified a technique that could be used to rapidly and effectively screen large projects for potential sulfate problems and to map the distribution of high- and low-clay subgrade soils.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/2310-10",""

Research shows that only a relatively few change efforts achieve great success—most just get by while the majority fail to reach predefined performance goals and objectives. That the success of planned change is relatively rare led to the following questions: (a) What facilitates or inhibits the change process? (b) How do these facilitators and inhibitors evolve within an organization? and (c) What are the implications of understanding this evolutionary process relative to achieving a more sustainable level of performance? This article addresses these questions and presents a holistic model for creating an open, fully transparent environment in which the many differences of potential relevance to a change are put in the open for analysis. The approach, the Full Dimensional Systems Model, assumes there are multiple, interrelated domains of influence that affect change and that these must each be appreciated and addressed simultaneously to achieve sustainable performance improvement.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2158244012461922",""

This paper describes floodplain beaver ponds on low‐gradient deltas in glacial finger lakes in Glacier National Park, Montana. These ponds are distinctly larger, probably fed by hyporheic flow, and stable and long‐lived. Ponds examined were, with one exception, 44 years old. Glacial discharge is present in each valley where beaver ponds occupy low‐gradient deltas, and this discharge likely sustains pond water level over the course of the summer. As glaciers recede and disappear, deltaic beaver ponds dependent on hyporheic flow may be negatively affected.

However, the structure and modulation of the neural activation maps underlying these patterns and their propagation remain elusive. We investigated effects of β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) stimulation on the spatiotemporal characteristics of emergent activity in rat hippocampal circuits. Synchronized epileptiform-like activity, such as interictal bursts (IBs) and ictal-like events (ILEs), were evoked by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), and their dynamics were studied using a combination of electrophysiology and fast voltage-sensitive dye imaging. Dynamic characterization of the spontaneous IBs showed that they originated in dentate gyrus/CA3 border and propagated toward CA1. To determine how β-AR modulates spatiotemporal characteristics of the emergent IBs, we used the β-AR agonist isoproterenol (ISO). ISO significantly reduced the spatiotemporal extent and propagation velocity of the IBs and significantly altered network activity in the 1- to 20-Hz range. Dual whole cell recordings of the IBs in CA3/CA1 pyramidal cells and optical analysis of those regions showed that ISO application reduced interpyramidal and interregional synchrony during the IBs. In addition, ISO significantly reduced duration not only of the shorter duration IBs but also the prolonged ILEs in 4-AP.

However, the interconnection among these proteins is unknown and, with the exception of L2, the connection of these proteins with membranes is also unknown. In this study, prompted by the findings that A6 coprecipitated A11 and that the cellular distribution of A11 was dramatically altered by repression of A6 expression, we studied the localization of A11 in cells by using immunofluorescence and cell fractionation analysis. A11 was found to associate with membranes and colocalize with virion membrane proteins in viral replication factories during normal VACV replication. A11 partitioned almost equally between the detergent and aqueous phases upon Triton X-114 phase separation, demonstrating an intrinsic affinity with lipids. However, in the absence of infection or VACV late protein synthesis, A11 did not associate with cellular membranes. Furthermore, when A6 expression was repressed, A11 did not colocalize with any viral membrane proteins or associate with membranes. In contrast, when virion envelope formation was blocked at a later step by repression of A14 expression or by rifampin treatment, A11 colocalized with virion membrane proteins in the factories. Altogether, our data showed that A11 associates with viral membranes during VACV replication, and this association requires A6 expression. This study provides a physical connection between A11 and viral membranes and suggests that A6 regulates A11 membrane association.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.01502-12",""

It seeks to address how selected elements of the marketing mix impact destination branding and how such marketing activity leads to residents eventually becoming committed to the destination’s branding efforts. Once committed and loyal to the brand, it proposes that residents may feel such a strong connection to the branding efforts of the destination, that the brand becomes aligned with their self-concept, and that they begin to serve as “evangelists” for the brand, actively promoting the destination via word of mouth. As a result, a civic consciousness is created that helps to strengthen the destination’s brand management system, especially as it is introduced to external constituents, such as potential tourists.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1356766712443469",""

Unlike political movements of the recent past, the Tea Party stands starkly to the right. This study examines nightly cable news coverage of this movement by using key frames associated with the “protest paradigm”—the tendency for media to marginalize movements by drawing attention away from core concerns raised by such movements. We ask whether the protest paradigm can be applied to a right-wing movement and whether such application varies by the ideological leaning of a given source. That is, do cable news channels use frames in ways consistent with their respective ideological hues? We draw on a representative sample of stories regarding the national movement from the most viewed nightly news programs on Fox News, MSNBC, and CNN, with the Associated Press as a reference point. Results show significant differences across sources in issue and marginalization frame use. Although utilization of marginalization frames is popular among ideological channels, traditional news sources are not immune from using these devices.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1940161212462872",""

All constructs previously have been identified as related concepts in certain ways; however, no specific and empirically verified structural complex model exists. In this research, first, the influential and causal relations among the variables were examined, and second, a model comparison was conducted between the initially proposed and alternatively proposed structural models. Structural equation modeling and canonical correlation analysis were used for the analyses. The results suggest that the input-related concept of learning culture is not directly related to outcome-related organizational financial improvement but rather has mediating effects through the process-related concept of knowledge creation.

For each sample, a panel of 14 analytes was measured. Three levels of outlier analyses were applied (analytical, intra‐individual, and inter‐individual), followed by nested Results: Specimens from 11 dogs were analyzed. Individuality indices ranged from 0.9 for glucose and total triglyceride concentrations to 3.4 for Conclusions: Many frequently measured analytes included in routine serum biochemical panels have high individuality. Thus, use of standard reference intervals to monitor changes over time in an individual is likely to miss meaningful biological change.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fj.1939-165x.2012.00473.x",""

We apply this framework and consider whether it provides a useful template for understanding the post-conflict dynamics of police–community relations in our study area. Contrary to much received wisdom our analysis suggests that instrumental concerns about crime and illegal activity are a more influential predictor of attitudes to the police than expressive concerns with disorder and anti-social behaviour. Consequently our discussion points to the variance in local and national survey data and questions the degree to which the latter can usefully inform our understanding of trends and developments in discrete micro-spaces.

This algorithm uses a genetic algorithm based on rank selection and elitist reinsertion and a modified constraint handling method. Because genetic algorithms are appropriate for high-dimensional stochastic problems with many nonlinearities or discontinuities, they are suited for solving reliability design problems. The developed algorithm mainly differs from other multiple objective evolutionary algorithms in the crossover operation performed and in the fitness assignment. In the crossover step, several offspring are created through multi-parent recombination. Thus, the mating pool contains a great amount of diverse solutions. The disruptive nature of the proposed type of crossover, called subsystem rotation crossover, encourages the exploration of the search space. The paper presents a multiple objective formulation of the redundancy allocation problem. The three objective functions that are simultaneously optimized are the maximization of system reliability, the minimization of system cost, and the minimization of system weight. The proposed algorithm was thoroughly tested and a performance comparison of the proposed algorithm against one well-known multiple objective evolutionary algorithms that currently exists shows that the algorithm has a better performance when solving multiple objective redundant allocation problems.</p>","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=66865",""

Methods: As such, the present study assessed ratings of satisfaction, perception of ability, and use of the S‐P training model within 653 clinical psychology graduate students enrolled in programs that are members of the Council of University Directors of Clinical Psychology. Results: Findings suggest that students are consistently trained in the integration of science and practice and have confidence in their abilities to apply the S‐P integration to research and clinical work. However, despite understanding the ways in which science can influence practice, over one third of students reported that they rarely use science‐based decisions when informing clients of the clinical services they will be providing. Conclusions: The implications of these results support the need for a more detailed evaluation of clinical psychology graduate students as well as the use of research‐informed practice and the process of providing clients with information they need to make informed choices about treatment.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fjclp.21883",""

The decrease of activation energy with increasing pressure reveals that the vibration damping of Nb-O dipoles is weakened in the orthorhombic and the tetragonal phases.

The transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4) is an ion channel that controls Ca2+ signals in excitable and nonexcitable cells. However, its role in stem cells remains unknown. The aim of this study was to characterize TRPM4 in rat dental follicle stem cells (DFSCs) and to determine its impact on Ca2+ signaling and the differentiation process. We identified TRPM4 gene expression in DFSCs, but not TRPM5, a closely related channel with similar function. Perfusion of cells with increasing buffered Ca2+ resulted in a concentration-dependent activation of currents typical for TRPM4, which were also voltage-dependent and had Na+ conductivity. Molecular suppression with shRNA decreased channel activity and cell proliferation during osteogenesis but not adipogenesis. As a result, enhanced mineralization and phosphatase enzyme activity were observed during osteoblast formation, although DFSCs failed to differentiate into adipocytes. Furthermore, the normal agonist-induced first and secondary phases of Ca2+ signals were transformed into a gradual and sustained increase which confirmed the channels' ability to control Ca2+ signaling. Using whole genome microarray analysis, we identified several genes impacted by TRPM4 during DFSC differentiation. These findings suggest an inhibitory role for TRPM4 on osteogenesis while it appears to be required for adipogenesis. The data also provide a potential link between the Ca2+ signaling pattern and gene expression during stem cell differentiation.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/stem.1264",""

This price maximizes an insurer’s expected profit and the insured’s expected utility, while taking into account the effects of risk control (self-protection) and risk financing (self-insurance). In addition, within this equilibrium framework, we derive the boundary level for the amount of foreign investment, the amount of political risk insurance coverage, and the minimum required rate of return of foreign investment.

Expression levels of STAT3 target genes were decreased in head and neck cancers following injection with the STAT3 decoy compared with tumors receiving saline control. Decoys have not been amenable to systemic administration due to instability. To overcome this barrier, we linked the oligonucleotide strands using hexaethylene glycol spacers. This cyclic STAT3 decoy bound with high affinity to STAT3 protein, reduced cellular viability, and suppressed STAT3 target gene expression in cancer cells. Intravenous injection of the cyclic STAT3 decoy inhibited xenograft growth and downregulated STAT3 target genes in the tumors. These results provide the first demonstration of a successful strategy to inhibit tumor STAT3 signaling via systemic administration of a selective STAT3 inhibitor, thereby paving the way for broad clinical development.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerdiscovery/article-pdf/2/8/694/1818469/694.pdf",""

Data Collection: Two instructors in a leadership-preparation program incorporated reflection assignments into their respective social-justice-related courses. One course was offered at the beginning of the program; the other offered at the end. Aspiring principals from two different cohorts of students participated in the study. The students’ reflections were coded to identify themes and patterns that were found in their reflections and to see if any of their reflections changed over time. Findings: The authors found that students had varied experiences with people who identified as LGBTQ. Second, we found that discussion of sexual orientation was complicated by students’ Christian beliefs. Third, we found that there was some change in the way in which students responded to sexual orientation, from a more passionate to a more analytical stance. We discuss these findings in light of the need for better assessment of future leaders’ attitudes and actions and of our own heteronormativity and heterosexism. We discuss implications for our own teaching as well as for other teachers in preparation programs.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0013161X12463231",""

We then undertook a study to determine if BRB might regress rectal polyps in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients. Fourteen FAP patients who had undergone a colectomy were treated with BRB daily for a period of nine months. Seven patients received BRB powder (20g/3x/day) orally in water plus two suppositories (each composed of 700 mg BRB) that patients inserted into the rectum one hour before bedtime. The other seven patients were randomized to receive an oral placebo plus the two rectal suppositories. Rectal polyp counts were taken at time zero and after nine months of BRB treatment. The number of rectal polyps was reduced by a median of 43% at nine months overall including a median reduction of 59% in patients treated by both routes and 36% in patients treated with the suppositories only. Polyps and aberrant crypt foci, both were histopathologically identified as tubular adenomas, and adjacent normal tissues were collected both before and after berry treatment. Promoter methylation of CDKN2A, also known as p16, in collected specimens was measured using MassARRAY. Global methylation LINE-1 was determined by Pyrosequencing. MBDCap-seq genome-wide methylation analysis was used to discover other genes demethylated by berries. Further, the specimens were evaluated for p16, Ki-67, TUNEL, DNMT1 and DNMT3B expression by semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry. Our results showed that treatment with BRB powder, both orally and in the form of a BRB suppository, significantly reduced cell proliferation in the tubular adenomas. The suppository alone was sufficient to decrease promoter methylation of p16 leading to an increase in p16 protein expression in adjacent normal rectum and in tubular adenomas. This was associated with decreased protein expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3B. Based on MBDCap-seq data, BRBs significantly demethylated promoter CpGs of 44 genes in tubular adenomas. These genes are involved in the regulation of important cellular functions; e.g., cell proliferation, Wnt signaling and Notch pathway, etc. Lastly, berry treatment did not induce changes in global methylation LINE-1. In conclusion, our data provide evidence that one of the mechanisms for BRB-induced rectal polyp regression in FAP patients is through the demethylation and reactivation of tumor suppressor genes.(Supported by NCI grants CA148818 and CA103180, and USDA grant 38903-03560).","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/72/8_Supplement/1009/577643/Abstract-1009-Regression-of-rectal-polyps-in",""

However, standards are silent about how these amounts should be determined and methods being used in practice vary widely, lack theoretical support, and may either fail to meet the audit objective or do so at excessive cost. We develop a Bayesian group audit model that generalizes and extends the single-component audit risk model to aggregate assurance across multiple components. The model formally incorporates group auditor knowledge of group-level structure, controls, and context as well as component-level constraints imposed by statutory audit or other requirements. Application of the model yields component materiality amounts that achieve the group auditor's overall assurance objective by finding the optimal solution on an efficient materiality frontier. Numerical results suggest group-level controls and structured subgroups of components are central to efficient group audits.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article-pdf/88/2/707/23987/accr-50314.pdf",""

Although this can seemingly misalign the interests of a manager, we show that the use of such measures can help supply chain partners to overcome hold‐up issues with respect to capacity and promotion investments. We develop a game theoretic model in which two supply chain partners engage in repeated interactions in which the supplier invests in capacity and the buyer invests in demand promotion. Following the realization of demand in each period, the two firms negotiate over the output quantity and wholesale price. The novelty of our model is that we allow the owners of each firm to delegate decision‐making power and negotiating responsibility to a free‐agent manager. We characterize the conditions under which the owners of both firms employ RF‐MPMs in equilibrium and benefit from doing so. For a special case of our model, we show that for the owners of the buyer, an RF‐MPM is equivalent to a price only relational contract, and that it complements a price and quantity relational contract as a mechanism for mitigating hold‐up issues.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2012.01322.x",""

Estrogen-dependent endometrioid carcinoma is the most common type of endometrial cancer. In previous studies, we have identified mitogen-inducible gene 6 (Mig-6) as a downstream target of Progesterone Receptor (Pgr) action in the uterus. Ablation of Mig-6 in the murine uterus leads to the development of endometrial hyperplasia and estrogen-induced endometrial cancer. These results suggest that Mig-6 act as a tumor suppressor in endometrial cancer. To assess the effects of the overexpression Mig-6 and the PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling pathways on uterine tumorigenesis, mice with Pten floxed (Ptenf/f) and LoxP-STOP-LoxP Mig-6 (R26Mig-6LSL) were bred to the PRCre mouse model to generate ablation of Pten and overexpression of Mig-6 in the uterus (PRcre+ R26Mig-6LSL Ptenf/f). PRcre+ R26Mig-6LSL Ptenf/f showed significantly increased survival time compared to PRcre/+ Ptenf/f mice. Double mutant mice showed significantly decreased uterine weight compared to PRcre/+Ptenf/f at 3 months of age. Gross morphology at 3 months of age showed that double mutant mice dramatically retarded the development of endometrial cancer compared to ablation of Pten alone. Histological analysis showed that endometrial adenocarcinoma with invasion into the myometrium was observed in the PRcre/+Ptenf/f mice at 3 months of age. However, double mutant mice did not develop endometrial cancer. Immunohistochemstry analysis showed significantly increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation at epithelial cells in PRcre+ R26Mig-6LSL Ptenf/f mice compared to PRcre/+ Ptenf/f mice at 3 months of age. The expression of pERK1/2 was significantly decreased in PRcre+ R26Mig-6LSL Ptenf/f mice compared to PRcre/+ Ptenf/f mice at 2 and 3 months of age. The expression of Pgr and its tartget genes was significantly increased in PRcre+ R26Mig-6LSL Ptenf/f mice compare to PRcre/+ Ptenf/f mice. However, the expression of Estrogen Receptor ≤ (Esr1) and its target genes was significantly decreased. The ability of Mig-6 to repress cancer development indicates that it exerts a tumor suppressor function in endometrial cancer. These results will contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanism of tumorigenesis and to the development of therapeutic approaches for endometrial cancer.(Supported by NIH, R01 HD057873)","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/72/8_Supplement/4182/581414/Abstract-4182-Overexpression-of-Mig-6-suppresses",""

Original respondents were compared with their adolescent offspring using identical models based on a partial general strain approach. Direct and indirect effects of strains on delinquency were generally consistent across generations. The discussion of the findings centers on general theoretical and methodological issues associated with a relatively unexplored avenue for understanding crime and delinquency.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0011128712446051",""

In addition, he argues that constraints and motivations are influenced by variables in five life domains. Capitalizing on longitudinal data of Paternoster’s Youths and Deterrence: Columbia, South Carolina, 1979-1981, a structural equation model is developed to test Agnew’s theory. Data limitations preclude a full test of the theory, but the results support the core proposition of the theory: Life domains increase delinquency by reducing constraints against delinquency and by increasing motivations for delinquency.

Using grounded theory, we explored the characteristics of positive psychological changes that occurred as the result of stressful intergroup contacts and acculturation from the perspective of Korean immigrant adolescents. We captured three main themes related to stress-related growth: (a) psychological thriving, (b) cultural and ethnic understandings, and (c) culturally attuned relationships.

Drawing from social network and life-course frameworks, the authors extend Hagan’s concept of criminal embeddedness to embeddedness within gangs. This study explores the relationship between embeddedness in a gang, a type of deviant network, and desistance from gang membership. Method. Data were gathered over a five-year period from 226 adjudicated youth reporting gang membership at the baseline interview. An item response theory model is used to construct gang embeddedness. The authors estimate a logistic hierarchical linear model to identify whether baseline levels of gang embeddedness alter the longitudinal contours of gang membership. Results. Gang embeddedness is associated with slowing the rate of desistance from gang membership over the full five-year study period. Gang members with low levels of embeddedness leave the gang quickly, crossing a 50 percent threshold in six months after the baseline interview, whereas high levels of embeddedness delays similar reductions until about two years. Males, Hispanics, and Blacks were associated with greater continuity in gang membership as well as those with low self-control. Conclusions. The concept of gang embeddedness broadens understanding of heterogeneity in deviant network immersion and is applicable to a wide range of criminal and delinquent networks. Gang embeddedness has implications for studying the parameters of gang careers and for a range of criminological outcomes.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0022427811434830",""

The new ccCA-CC(2,3) method predicts thermodynamic properties with an accuracy that is similar to that of the original ccCA-S4 method. At the same time, the inclusion of the single-reference CR-CC(2,3) approach provides a ccCA scheme that can correctly treat reaction pathways that contain certain classes of multi-reference species such as diradicals, which would normally need to be treated by more computationally demanding multi-reference methods. The new ccCA-CC(2,3) method produces a mean absolute deviation of 1.7 kcal/mol for predicted heats of formation at 298 K, based on calibration with the G2/97 set of 148 molecules, which is comparable to that of 1.0 kcal/mol obtained using the ccCA-S4 method, while significantly improving the performance of the ccCA-S4 approach in calculations involving more demanding radical and diradical species. Both the ccCA-CC(2,3) and ccCA-S4 composite methods are used to characterize the conrotatory and disrotatory isomerization pathways of bicyclo[1.1.0]butane to trans-1,3-butadiene, for which conventional coupled cluster methods, such as the CCSD(T) approach used in the ccCA-S4 model and, in consequence, the ccCA-S4 method itself might fail by incorrectly placing the disrotatory pathway below the conrotatory one. The ccCA-CC(2,3) scheme provides correct pathway ordering while providing an accurate description of the activation and reaction energies characterizing the lowest-energy conrotatory pathway. The ccCA-CC(2,3) method is thus a viable method for the analyses of reaction mechanisms that have significant multi-reference character, and presents a generally less computationally intensive alternative to true multi-reference methods, with computer costs and ease of use that are similar to those that characterize the more established, CCSD(T)-based, ccCA-S4 methodology.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.3700801/15449173/144109_1_online.pdf",""

Most modern DSP provide multiple address registers and dedicated address generation units that provide address generation in parallel to instruction execution. There is no address computation overhead if the next address is within the auto-modify range of the address register. Many DSP algorithms have an iterative pattern of references to array elements within loops. Thus, a careful assignment of array references to address registers (called the address register allocation or ARA problem) reduces the number of explicit address arithmetic instructions as well as the execution cycles. In this paper, we present an optimal integer linear programming formulation for the address register allocation problem which incorporates code restructuring techniques. In addition, we have developed a Genetic Algorithm solution for the ARA problem that allows us to get near-optimal solutions in a reasonable amount of time for large embedded applications. Results on several benchmarks show the effectiveness of our techniques compared to other techniques in the literature.","https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S0218126612500156",""

Heifer total leukocyte counts decreased 1 h after CRH administration, while bull leukocyte counts and percent neutrophils decreased 2 h after CRH administration.

In this paper, we show that our simple approach not only yields similar conclusions in the analysis of the performance of items on the FCI to the more sophisticated and complex IRT analyses but also permits additional insights by characterizing both the correct and incorrect answer choices. Our IRC approach can be applied to a variety of multiple-choice assessments but, as applied to a carefully designed instrument such as the FCI, allows us to probe student understanding as a function of ability level through an examination of each answer choice. We imagine that physics teachers could use IRC analysis to identify prominent misconceptions and tailor their instruction to combat those misconceptions, fulfilling the FCI authors’ original intentions for its use. Furthermore, the IRC analysis can assist test designers to improve their assessments by identifying nonfunctioning distractors that can be replaced with distractors attractive to students at various ability levels.","https://pubs.aip.org/aapt/ajp/article-pdf/80/9/825/13062349/825_1_online.pdf",""

To better understand 1) why patients have a negative perception of the use of computerized clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) and 2) what contributes to the documented heterogeneity in the evaluations of physicians who use a CDSS. Methods. Three vignette-based studies examined whether negative perceptions stemmed directly from the use of a computerized decision aid or the need to seek external advice more broadly (experiment 1) and investigated the contributing role of 2 individual difference measures, attitudes toward statistics (ATS; experiment 2) and the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale (MHLC; experiment 3), to these findings. Results. A physician described as making an unaided diagnosis was rated significantly more positively on a number of attributes than a physician using a computerized decision aid but not a physician who sought the advice of an expert colleague (experiment 1). ATS were unrelated to perceptions of decision aid use (experiment 2); however, greater internal locus of control was associated with more positive feelings about unaided care and more negative feelings about care when a decision aid was used (experiment 3). Conclusion. Negative perceptions of computerized decision aid use may not be a product of the need to seek external advice more generally but may instead be specific to the use of a nonhuman tool and may be associated with individual differences in locus of control. Together, these 3 studies may be used to guide education efforts for patients.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0272989X12453501",""

In this article, we describe the development and evaluation of currently available transdermal alcohol sensors, present the strengths and limitations of the technology, and give examples of recent research using the sensors.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fj.1530-0277.2012.01869.x",""

The Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes (BARI 2D) trial provided an opportunity to examine the long-term clinical impact of completeness of revascularization in patients with diabetes. Methods and Results—: This is a post hoc, nonrandomized analysis of the completeness of revascularization in 751 patients who were randomly assigned to early revascularization, of whom 264 underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery and 487 underwent percutaneous coronary intervention. The completeness of revascularization was determined by the residual postprocedure myocardial jeopardy index (RMJI). RMJI is a ratio of the number of myocardial territories supplied by a significantly diseased epicardial coronary artery or branch that was not successfully revascularized, divided by the total number of myocardial territories. Mean follow-up for mortality was 5.3 years. Complete revascularization (RMJI=0) was achieved in 37.9% of patients, mildly incomplete revascularization (RMJI >0≤33) in 46.6%, and moderately to severely incomplete revascularization (RMJI >33) in 15.4%.

Pending the availability of the more appropriate phase 5 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP-5) simulations, the method is demonstrated using CMIP-3 model simulations. Although the CMIP-3 experimental design will almost certainly prevent these model runs from reproducing features of historical IMD climate variability, these simulations allow for the demonstration of the method and illustrate how the models and observations disagree. This method samples a time series’s data rankings over moving time windows, converts those ranking sets to a Mann–Whitney U statistic, and then normalizes the U statistic into a Z statistic. By detecting optimally significant IMD ranking regimes of arbitrary onset and varying duration, this process generates time series of Z values that are an adaptively low-passed and normalized transformation of the original time series. Principal component (PC) analysis of the Z series derived from observed annual temperatures at 92 U.S. grid locations during 1919–2008 shows two dominant modes: a PC1 mode with cool temperatures before the late 1960s and warm temperatures after the mid-1980s, and a PC2 mode indicating a multidecadal temperature cycle over the Southeast. Using a graphic analysis of a Z error metric that compares modeled and observed Z series, the three CMIP-3 model simulations tested here are shown to reproduce the PC1 mode but not the PC2 mode. By providing a way to compare grid-level IMD climate response patterns in observed and modeled data, this method can play a useful diagnostic role in future model development and decadal climate forecasting.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00211.1",""

However, its interpretation remains controversial because EP observations are not globally available and observations of one of its key controls, surface incident solar radiation Rs, are even less available. Using global-distributed Rs from both direct measurements (available through the Global Energy Balance Archive) and derived from sunshine duration, the authors calculated the potential evaporation from 1982 to 2008 from approximately 1300 stations. The findings herein show that the contribution of water vapor pressure deficit (VPD) to monthly variability of EP is much larger than that of other controlling factors, of Rs, wind speed (WS), and air temperature Ta. The trend of the aerodynamic component of EP, which includes contributions of VPD, WS, and Ta, accounted for 86% of the long-term trend of EP. The aerodynamic component was then calculated from 4250 globally distributed stations and showed a negligible averaged trend from 1973 to 2008 because the reduction in WS canceled out the impact of the elevated VPD. The long-term trend of WS dominates the long-term trend of the aerodynamic component of EP at the 4250 stations. Atmospheric evaporative demand increased in most arid and semiarid areas, indicating a decrease in water availability in those areas.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jcli/article-pdf/25/23/8353/3994508/jcli-d-11-00492_1.pdf",""

Given a time and financial budget for DNA sequencing, the question arises as to how to allocate the finite number of sequence reads among three dimensions: (i) sequencing individual nucleotide positions repeatedly and achieving high confidence in the true genotype of individuals, (ii) sampling larger numbers of individuals from a population, and (iii) sampling a larger fraction of the genome. Leaving aside the question of what fraction of the genome to sample, we analyze the trade‐off between repeatedly sequencing the same nucleotide position (coverage depth) and the number of individuals in the sample. We review simple Bayesian models for allele frequencies and utilize these in the analysis of how to obtain maximal information about population genetic parameters. The models indicate that sampling larger numbers of individuals, at the expense of coverage depth per nucleotide position, provides more information about population parameters. Dividing the sequencing effort maximally among individuals and obtaining approximately one read per locus and individual (1 × coverage) yields the most information about a population. Some analyses require genetic parameters for individuals, in which case Bayesian population models also support inference from lower coverage sequence data than are required for simple likelihood models. Low coverage sequencing is not only sufficient to support inference, but it is optimal to design studies to utilize low coverage because they will yield highly accurate and precise parameter estimates based on more individuals or sites in the genome.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fmec.12105",""

The cohort included 723 adolescents (mean age = 14.7 years at baseline) from Minnesota. Total sleep duration was assessed via self-report. BMI and PBF were objectively assessed. Covariates used in the multivariate analyses included energy intake as assessed through 24-hour recalls, activity levels as assessed by accelerometers, screen time/sedentary behavior, depression, and sociodemographic characteristics. For both males and females, average BMI and PBF increased slightly over the 2 years and average sleep duration decreased by about 30 minutes. The authors saw no statistically significant longitudinal relationships between change in total sleep and change in BMI or PBF over time in either girls or boys. The only longitudinal relationship that approached statistical significance was a positive association between sleep and PBF in females ( p = .068). This research contributes to the literature as the only study to date to examine how change in sleep duration during adolescence may be related to a concomitant change in BMI and body fat.

This study attempted to develop a link between driver safety and the nighttime visual environment. This research required creating and integrating new technology, observing and collecting data, and developing a model framework called the Dynamic Driver Visual Model (DDVM). Conceptually, a DDVM is a system of rules, statistics, and expectations that can be used to define how a driver collects visual information from the environment. Several information sources were investigated, and several dependent variables were identified. Data were collected on how information from signage, objects, lighting, pavement markings, and other vehicles moderates a driver's visual search of the roadway environment. Several logistic regression analyses were performed on the collected data to identify common characteristics to be implemented in the DDVM. These variables included age, lighting, vehicle headlamps, several different objects, glance time, target luminance, and contrast information. The results suggest that a number of target and visibility elements have nonlinear effects on a driver's detection performance at a variety of detection distances. This paper discusses the implications of these findings and the initial framework of the DDVM.

We have found that mutation of an active site alanine (A328) to valine produces an enzyme with greatly improved substrate binding, spin‐state conversion, and turnover rate. Mutation of the same residue to serine, however, results in greatly impaired spin‐state conversion and impaired substrate binding. Even more intriguing, the effect of the A328S mutant on V","",""

The issue has been further complicated by the emergence and understanding of inflammatory proteins. Previously we reported acrolein‐induced vascular toxicity requires SRF dependent activation/expression of NFkB. We confirmed that SRF inhibition attenuates NFkB. In this study we explored expression of genes involved in inflammatory process and involvement of SRF or NFkB. VSMCs were treated with acrolein (0.5 μg/ml; 24 hrs) with or without pre‐incubation with Helenalin (NFkB inhibitor; 2 μM) or CCG (SRF inhibitor; 300 nM) for 30 min. RNA was isolated, gene expression was measured using PCR array examining 84 genes. Acrolein causes over‐expression of 6 genes (4–16 fold) and under‐expression of 8 genes (7–48 fold). Casp1 (Caspase 1; 12 fold) and Cx3cl1 (Chemokine Ligand 1; 12 fold), involved in cell death and exaggerated immune response, were over‐expressed. IL11 and Spp1 were reduced 36 and 24 fold respectively. SRF inhibitor enhanced expression of Abc1, a gene responsible for ATP binding and mRNA transcription by 15 fold. SRF and NFkB inhibition reduced Cx3cl1 expression (7 fold and 4 fold respectively) that was over‐expressed in acrolein treated cells. These observations suggests that acrolein induced activation of inflammatory signaling involves expression of Cx3Cl1 gene and is SRF and NFkB dependent.","",""

Amphibian species richness or abundance at created and restored wetlands was either similar to or greater than reference wetlands in 89% of studies. Use of created and restored wetlands by individual species was driven by aquatic and terrestrial habitat preferences, as well as ability to disperse from source wetlands.

The primary steps included a crash analysis, an observational field study, and a driver behavioral study. This research reached several key conclusions, as follows. Vehicle merging speeds tend to be closer to freeway speeds at tapered acceleration lanes than at parallel acceleration lanes. The recommended minimum lengths for acceleration lanes presented in the 2004 edition of AASHTO's A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets (Green Book) are conservative and, under certain conditions, could be reduced by 15%. In a situation in which a significant volume of trucks uses an entrance ramp, an acceleration lane length that will better accommodate trucks can be derived by using speed–distance curves developed for a range of weight-to-power ratios. The recommended minimum lengths for deceleration lanes presented in the 2004 Green Book are conservative and do not account for deceleration in the freeway. Providing deceleration lanes longer than the minimum values given in the Green Book may promote casual deceleration by exiting drivers. Several potential changes for consideration in the next edition of the Green Book are recommended on the basis of the findings and conclusions of this research.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/2309-06",""

The Holocene delta plain was constructed by cyclical growth of deltaic headlands, followed by avulsion and relocation of the fluvial sediment source. Abandoned headlands were then submerged and reworked while a new headland was created at the site of active fluvial sediment input. Historic-period levees have decoupled the delta plain from its fluvial sediment source at the same time global sea-level rise was accelerating, which has accelerated delta-plain submergence. Diversions of Mississippi River water and sediment are necessary to achieve delta plain sustainability, but upstream dams trap ∼50% of the total sediment load, and there is not enough supply to keep pace with subsidence and accelerated sea-level rise.

We find that audit fees and resignations are positively associated with the risk of upward earnings management. We document a pecking order of auditor responses and find that auditors are more likely to respond in the order of charging higher abnormal audit fees if the trade-off between upward earnings management risk and return is within an acceptable level, and then resign if the risk is more severe and exceeds the auditors' tolerance level. Our results are robust to alternative accruals measures, controlling for clients' internal control quality and corporate governance characteristics.","https://publications.aaahq.org/ajpt/article-pdf/32/2/147/46983/ajpt-50372.pdf",""

METHODS: Eligible Latinas had an abnormality of BIRADS 3, 4, or 5 detected on a mammogram, clinical breast exam, magnetic resonance imaging, or ultrasound between July 2008 and December 2010 in six U.S. cities (San Antonio, Miami, Houston, San Diego, New York, and San Francisco). Data were pooled for this analysis. Navigated patients received assistance by locally trained navigators using a patient-centered model suggested by Harold Freeman and endorsed by the Institute of Medicine. Non-navigated patient data was obtained via retrospective medical chart review. We used Log-Rank Chi-squared tests to evaluate bivariate associations with dependent variables and Kaplan-Meier and Cox Proportional Hazards analyses to compare time-to-diagnosis and timely diagnosis estimates between Navigated and Control group Latinas. RESULTS: Among 480 women with initial BIRADS 3, 4, or 5 results, follow-up data was available for 425 (88.5%). Radiologic classification of initial abnormality (BIRADS), rather than any other sociodemographic or clinical characteristic was the only significant predictor of overall and timely diagnosis. Data for women with an initial BIRADS 3 result were adjusted to control clinician-imposed diagnostic delays. Of all women, &gt; 95% achieved definitive diagnosis within 180 days. Median time to definitive diagnosis was significantly reduced among navigated compared to non-navigated Latinas (20 days versus 27 days, hazard ratio [HR] 1.32, p = .007). This translates to a 132% increase in rates of diagnosis among navigated women. This effect was primarily observed in women with an initial BIRADS 3 result, especially when adjusted for clinically directed waiting periods between initial and follow-up screening examinations. Among navigated patients, only between-BIRADS variation rather than sociodemographic characteristics, number of barriers to care, insurance status or type or site-specific variables were associated with timely or time-to-diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Patient-centered navigation to assist Latina women with breast screening abnormalities reduces median time-to-diagnosis by approximately 25% when types of screening abnormality and barriers to care are addressed at patient level. Community-based interventions may be the most effective means to reduce cancer health disparities when addressing the needs of underserved populations.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/72/8_Supplement/4450/581521/Abstract-4450-Navigating-Latinas-with-breast",""

However, it is not always possible to provide personally relevant content. Under such circumstances, the best that a system can do is provide contextually relevant peripheral content (e.g., ads) based on the topic of the main content (e.g., search-engine output). This raises an important question: Does context relevance have the same positive effects on user perceptions of websites as personal relevance? If context relevance can indeed make up for the lack of personalization, then boosting it via ad content on the site should serve to enhance appeal even when the main content is not personalized.

However, its signaling pathway is not well elucidated. This study was to explore the functional roles and signaling pathway of TCF4 in maintaining adult stem cell properties using human corneal epithelial stem cells as a model. With immunofluorescent staining and real-time polymerase chain reaction, we observed that TCF4 was exclusively expressed in the basal layer of human limbal epithelium where corneal epithelial stem cells reside. TCF4 was found to be well colocalized with ABCG2 and p63, two recognized epithelial stem/progenitor cell markers. Using in vitro culture models of primary human corneal epithelial cells, we revealed that TCF4 mRNA and protein were upregulated by cells in exponential growth stage, and RNA interference by small interfering RNA-TCF4 (10-50 nM) transfection blocked TCF4 signaling and suppressed cell proliferation as measured by WST-1 assay. TCF4 silence was found to be accompanied by downregulated proliferation-associated factors p63 and survivin, as well as upregulated cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C (p57). By creating a wound healing model in vitro, we identified upregulation and activation of β-catenin/TCF4 with their protein translocation from cytoplasm to nuclei, as evaluated by reverse transcription-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunostaining, and Western blotting. Upregulated p63/survivin and downregulated p57 were further identified to be TCF4 downstream molecules that promote cell migration and proliferation in wound healing process. These findings demonstrate that transcription factor TCF4 plays an important role in determining or maintaining the phenotype and functional properties of human corneal epithelial stem cells.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/stem.1032",""

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has increased in the U.S. from 1975-2006 while overall cancer has declined. Moreover, HCC among South Texas Latinos is higher than other U.S. Latinos. In recent years a number of risk factors have been associated with HCC including hepatitis-C virus infection, heavy alcohol use, obesity, diabetes and others. Of these, only diabetes exhibits characteristics which make it a candidate for why HCC is increasing in the U.S. Latino population and increasingly higher among South Texas Latinos. This study compares incidence rates of HCC and prevalence rates of diabetes among U.S. Latinos and South Texas Latinos. We hypothesize that these data implicate diabetes in HCC and suggest a clear path to informed HCC prevention. Methods. Data from the U.S. SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) Program, Texas Cancer Registry, and the Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS) were obtained. Age-adjusted HCC incidence rates were calculated using SEER*Stat and SPSS software and aggregated over 3-year periods. Likewise, annual prevalence of diabetes was calculated and aggregated over the same periods. For each measure values for the mutually exclusive U.S. and South Texas populations were compared. Trend slopes for both HCC and diabetes were calculated and displayed graphically. Group differences were assessed at p &lt; .05 if confidence intervals did not overlap. Results. U.S. (SEER) Latino HCC incidence averaged 6.1/100,000 during 1995-1997 and increased to 8.0 during 2004-2006 (slope m = 0.455). South Texas Latino rates averaged 9.2 and 11.7 during the same periods (slope m = 0.625) (incidence rate difference, p &lt; .05). Simultaneously, the prevalence rate of diabetes was 5.9% and 7.7% among U.S. SEER Latinos (slope m = 0.450) and 7.6% and 9.6% among South Texas Latinos (slope m = 0.500) (prevalence rate difference, p &lt; .05). Although slope differences could not be calculated, they indicate a greater rate of increase among South Texas Latinos than U.S. SEER Latinos. Conclusion. Our findings support observations that HCC and diabetes are increasing in the United States. We have described an important relationship between increasing rates of HCC and diabetes in the U.S. SEER and South Texas Latino populations. We suggest this relationship may explain higher rates of HCC among Latinos. There is a need to focus HCC etiological research to account for this relationship while simultaneously on other attributable risks for the disease as well as genetic, cultural and socioeconomic predisposing features. We note that diabetes is preventable or treatable. The potential contribution of this research can firmly establish associations and inform HCC prevention. Acknowledgements.

When lacking (vs. possessing) control, Westerners are relatively more likely to rely on horoscopes that help them understand themselves, whereas East Asians are relatively more likely to rely on horoscopes that help them understand others.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of inequality and poverty in addition to spatial dependence between neighboring regions on HIV mortality rate, which can lead to improved health resource allocation decisions. In modeling county‐specific HIV counts, we propose Bayesian zero‐inflated Poisson models whose rates are functions of both covariate and spatial/random effects. To show how the proposed models work, we used three different publicly available data sets: TIGER Shapefiles, Census 2000, and mortality index files.

Ibrutinib (PCI-32765), an oral inhibitor to BTK, promotes apoptosis and inhibits proliferation, migration and adhesion in CLL cells. Chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) treatment approaches such as fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab have markedly improved outcomes of younger, fit patients (pts) as initial or second-line therapy. While effective, fludarabine-based therapy is less well tolerated in the elderly and carries significant risk of cellular immune suppression and myelosupression that limit protracted use. Additionally, virtually all pts eventually relapse after fludarabine-based CIT and effective salvage regimens that induce durable remissions are lacking. Herein, we present mature data from a large (n=116 pts) multi-cohort Phase Ib/II trial of ibrutinib in treatment-naive (TN) or relapsed/refractory (RR) CLL/SLL. Pts experienced a high frequency of disease control extending beyond 22 months in both TN and RR CLL/SLL including those with high risk genomic features. Methods:: Pts who were TN (all age >=65 years), RR (>= 2 prior therapies including a purine analog), or high-risk (HR) (relapse within 2 years following combination CIT or del 17p) were enrolled into 5 cohorts evaluating oral ibrutinib at fixed doses of 420mg or 840mg daily until disease progression (PD). Results:: The majority of AEs have been Gr ≤ 2 in severity, most commonly diarrhea (54%), fatigue (29%), upper respiratory tract infection (29%), rash (28%), nausea (26%) and arthralgias (25%). Hematologic toxicity ≥ Gr 3 was relatively infrequent. There was no evidence of cumulative toxicity or long-term safety concerns with a median follow-up of 16 months for the 116 treated pts. Treatment discontinuation for AE occurred in 7/116 pts across cohorts. Serial evaluation of serum immunoglobulins revealed a significant increase in IgA at 3, 6, and 12 months (P < 0.005 at each time point) with no decline in IgG or IgM. Conclusions:: Ibrutinib monotherapy is highly active, well tolerated, and induces durable remissions in pts with RR CLL including those with high-risk disease and in older TN pts warranting phase III evaluation in these populations.

A comparison group of 49 children from Grade 2, 54 children from Grade 3, and 55 children from Grade 4, whose home language and instruction was English, were also administered tests of decoding, listening, and reading comprehension. Multiple regression analysis showed that approximately 60% of the variance in reading comprehension of Spanish participants and 50% of the variance in reading comprehension of English participants were explained by decoding and listening comprehension. Furthermore, the performance of third grade Spanish participants resembled that of fourth grade English-speaking participants. In the second study, 102 Chinese students from Grade 2 and 106 students from Grade 4 were administered tasks of Chinese character recognition, reading fluency, listening, and reading comprehension.

The current paper seeks to inform rural community–university partnership practice through consideration of first‐person accounts from five stakeholders in the Rural Embedded Assistants for Community Health (REACH) Network. The REACH Network is a unique community–university partnership aimed at improving rural health services by identifying, implementing, and evaluating innovative health interventions delivered by local caregivers. The first‐person accounts provide an insider's perspective on the nature of collaboration. The unique perspectives identify three critical challenges facing the REACH Network: trust, coordination, and sustainability. Through consideration of the challenges, we identified several strategies for success. We hope readers can learn their own lessons when considering the details of our partnership's efforts to improve the delivery infrastructure for rural healthcare.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1007%2Fs10464-012-9515-9",""

We carried out a pilot clinical study in Shanxi province, China, to evaluate a low-cost, high-resolution microendoscope (HRME) imaging system which enables evaluation of epithelial cell morphology in vivo. HRME images were obtained at discrete sites on the cervix in 174 women, in addition to visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and colposcopic examination. Of 69 sites appearing abnormal on colposcopy, only 12 showed high-grade disease (CIN2+) on pathology. Quantification of the nuclear-to-cytoplasm ratio by HRME enabled an ad hoc threshold to be defined, which correctly classified all 12 sites as abnormal, whilst classifying 38 of the remaining 57 pathology normal sites as normal. All patients with biopsy confirmed high-grade disease also tested positive for high-risk human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA and were classified as abnormal by HRME. Among the remaining patients who tested positive for HPV but were either normal by colposcopy or showed &lt;CIN2 on pathology, only 6 of 32 (18.8%) were classified as abnormal by HRME.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerpreventionresearch/article-pdf/5/11/1273/1711514/1273.pdf",""

There is scant quantitative experimental data on the alterations of the MV fiber network reorganization as a function of load, which is critical for implementation of computational strategies that attempt to link this meso-micro scale phenomenon. The observed large scale deformations experienced by VICs could be implicated in mechanotransduction [2], i.e., translation of mechanical stimuli into biochemical signals.

Second, the average number of offenders per criminal incident is also highest in youth and decreases as offenders age. These regularities, and co-offending in general, are often explained with reference to a developmental approach: youth spend more time in groups than adults for their activities and crime is simply one of those activities. We investigate these empirical regularities by single years of age, 12–29, with a detailed crime classification in a large sample from British Columbia. These empirical regularities prove to be far from monolithic, being less notable as offenders age for several violent crime classifications.","https://utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/cjccj.2010.E.49",""

In this study, we aimed to comprehensively assess single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the caspase-8 (CASP8) and caspase-10 (CASP10) genes in relation to toxicity outcomes with first-line platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We genotyped 13 tag SNPs of CASP8 and CASP10 in 663 patients with advanced NSCLC treated with platinum-based chemotherapy regimens. Associations between SNPs and chemotherapy toxicity outcomes were identified in a discovery set of 279 patients and then validated in an independent set of 384 patients. In both the discovery and validation sets, variant homozygotes of CASP8 rs12990906 and heterozygotes of CASP8 rs3769827 and CASP10 rs11674246 and rs3731714 had a significantly lower risk for severe toxicity overall. However, only the association with the rs12990906 variant was replicated in the validation set for hematological toxicity risk. In a stratified analysis, we found that some other SNPs, including rs3769821, rs3769825, rs7608692, and rs12613347, were significantly associated with severe toxicity risk in some subgroups, such as in nonsmoking patients, patients with adenocarcinoma, and patients treated with cisplatin combinations. Consistent results were also found in haplotype analyses. Our results provide novel evidence that polymorphisms in CASP8 and CASP10 may modulate toxicity outcomes in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. If validated, the findings will facilitate the genotype-based selection of platinum-based chemotherapy regimens.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1634/theoncologist.2011-0419",""

The Federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has developed Federal Standards to assist with the uniform documentation and reporting of race and ethnicity. A minimum of five defined categories currently exist for race (American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander and White). Ethnicity is separated into either Hispanic origin or Non-Hispanic origin. Current death certificates allow for the selection of one or more races; however, only one ethnicity may be chosen. Race of unknown decedents is either based subjectively on the observer's opinion or, in severely decomposed or skeletal remains, by anthropological analysis utilizing sound statistical methodology. If the data and statistical analysis suggest a good classification, the race determination will be correct more often than not. Information obtained from the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) indicates that absence of race determination does not hinder the identification potential. Mortality rates, life expectancy, disease risk and causes of death are often disaggregated by race and/or ethnicity. Differences in the presentation, etiology and outcomes of many diseases have been based on race and ethnicity data. Uniform collection of this data is the key to its importance.

In Study 2, behavior specialists’ use of the DPR to make student treatment decisions in the CCE program was partially validated. The utility of placing students with low DPR percentages into interventions based on functional behavior assessment (FBA) was validated. In Study 3, the treatment duration of 4 weeks above the 75th percentile on the DPR proved to be an efficacious treatment outcome predictor versus 8 weeks duration, which was originally recommended in the CCE protocol.

Data was collected at two field locations during the first seven months of two field seasons. Based on multi-regression analysis, we demonstrated that precipitation was positively associated with ranked plant weight, daily minimum relative humidity and maximum temperature were negatively associated with plant weight, and that there may be specific optimal growth conditions regarding cumulative solar radiation and wind speed. The outlined multi-regression approach may be considered appropriate for ecological studies of canola establishment and pest communities elsewhere and therefore enable identification of suitable regions for successful canola production. We also demonstrated that aphids were about 35% more abundant on non-treated seeds than on treated seeds, but the sensitivity to seed treatment was only within four months after plant emergence. On the other hand, seed treatment had negligible effect on presence of thrips.","http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/ija/2012/838903.pdf",""

The computer program included an assessment of the participant’s smoking behavior and personalized feedback. Methods: Self-identified smoking parents of children presenting to a general pediatric outpatient clinic completed measures of motivation and readiness to cease smoking. Participants were then randomly assigned to complete the computer program or receive treatment as usual. One month after completing the intervention, participants were contacted either in person or by phone to complete measures of motivational readiness to engage in smoking cessation. Results: Compared to treatment-as-usual parents, intervention parents reported increased readiness to change their smoking at follow-up. This effect appeared to strengthen, favoring the intervention condition, when analyses included only those participants who identified at baseline that they were contemplating quitting smoking in the next 6 months. Conclusions: Results of this small study supported the integration of a brief computerized tobacco intervention in the pediatric primary care setting and provided some evidence for efficacy. Brief, self-administered, and computer-based interventions such as this can be disseminated and deployed at relatively little cost or burden to existing practices, which makes small effects more meaningful and justifiable. Future investigations should investigate this intervention with larger samples and with expanded measures of parent smoking behavior.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2150131912442898",""

Nocturnal vertebrates typically have large corneas relative to eye size as an adaptation for increased visual sensitivity. Conversely, diurnal vertebrates generally demonstrate smaller corneas relative to eye size as an adaptation for increased visual acuity. By contrast, several studies have concluded that many mammals exhibit typical nocturnal eye shapes, regardless of activity pattern. However, a recent study has argued that new statistical methods allow eye shape to accurately predict activity patterns of mammals, including cathemeral species (animals that are equally likely to be awake and active at any time of day or night). Here, we conduct a detailed analysis of eye shape and activity pattern in mammals, using a broad comparative sample of 266 species. We find that the eye shapes of cathemeral mammals completely overlap with nocturnal and diurnal species. Additionally, most diurnal and cathemeral mammals have eye shapes that are most similar to those of nocturnal birds and lizards. The only mammalian clade that diverges from this pattern is anthropoids, which have convergently evolved eye shapes similar to those of diurnal birds and lizards. Our results provide additional evidence for a nocturnal ‘bottleneck’ in the early evolution of crown mammals.","https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rspb.2012.2258",""

The potential role of different cytochrome p450 metabolizing enzymes in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in an area of active interest. In this study, we demonstrate aberrant CYP2E1 mRNA over-expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in 11 cases of de novo AML with inv(16); CBFβ-MYH11. CYP2E1 mRNA levels correlated with CBFβ-MYH11 transcript levels and with bone marrow blast counts in all cases. CYP2E1 over-expression correlated positively with NQO1 mRNA levels (R2 = 0.934, n = 7). By immunohistochemistry, CYP2E1 protein was more frequently expressed in AML with inv(16) compared with other types of AML (p < 0.001). We obtained serial bone marrow samples from two patients with AML with inv(16) before and after treatment. CYP2E1 mRNA expression levels decreased in parallel with CBFβ-MYH11 transcript levels and blast counts following chemotherapy. In contrast, CYP1A2 transcript levels did not change in either patient. This is the first study to demonstrate concurrent over-expression of CYP2E1 and NQO1 mRNA in AML with inv(16). These findings also suggest that a balance between CYP2E1 and NQO1 may be important in the pathogenesis of AML with inv(16).","https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/9/8/2788/pdf",""

The results from a model using 7499 consumers’ online ratings of 114 hotels support the hypotheses. Other consumers’ online ratings weaken the effects of positive and regular negative features of product experience but can either exacerbate or overturn the negative effect of product failure, depending on the quality of product recovery. For marketing theory, the findings indicate that consumers who influence others are themselves influenced by other consumers and that this influence is contingent on their product experience. For managerial practice, the authors offer a method to estimate the effects of product experience characteristics on online product ratings and show that social influence effects make high online product ratings a double-edged sword, exacerbating the negative effect of product failure and strengthening the benefit of product recovery.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1509/jm.10.0377",""

Traditional field‐based levelling survey methods are very time consuming and subject to human‐induced arbitrariness and error. This article presents an approach to modelling detention basins measured from light detection and ranging remote sensing data. A case study is illustrated by using the White Oak Bayou watershed of Harris County, Texas. The storage–stage curve obtained from the volumetric analysis is used in a modified detention basins routing model, which was developed by adding the weir structure control to the traditional hydrologic reservoir routing equations. The model simulation showed that the peak flow of the synthetic 100‐year reoccurrence event was effectively reduced and delayed by the detention basins. The comparison with the simulation results from the traditional reservoir routing model suggested that previous studies using the reservoir routing model were likely to underestimate the flood reduction effect of detention basins. The sensitivity analysis of the parameters showed that the detention basin design and evaluation should pay more attention on the weir height and river channel's roughness.

Controversy still exists regarding the origin of the cell source for cellular cementum (epithelial or mesenchymal). This disagreement may be partially due to a lack of understanding of the events leading to the initiation and development of the tooth roots and supportive tissues, such as the cementum. Osterix (OSX) is a transcriptional factor essential for osteogenesis, but its role in cementogenesis has not been addressed. In the present study, we first documented a close relationship between the temporal- and spatial-expression pattern of Osx and the formation of cellular cementum. We then generated 3.6-kilobase (kb) collagen type I (3.6-kb Col 1)-Osx transgenic mice, which displayed accelerated cementum formation versus wild-type (WT) controls. Importantly, the conditional deletion of Osx in the mesenchymal cells with two different Cre systems (the 2.3-kb Col 1 and an inducible CAG–Cre estrogen receptor [CreER]) led to a sharp reduction in cellular cementum formation (including the cementum mass and mineral deposition rate) and gene expression of dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) by cementocytes. However, the deletion of the Osx gene after cellular cementum formed did not alter the properties of the mature cementum as evaluated by backscattered scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and resin-casted SEM. Transient transfection of Osx in the cementoblasts in vitro significantly inhibited cell proliferation and increased cell differentiation and mineralization. Taken together, these data support: (1) the mesenchymal origin of cellular cementum (from periodontal ligament [PDL] progenitor cells); (2) the vital role of OSX in controlling the formation of cellular cementum; and (3) the limited remodeling of cellular cementum in adult mice. © 2012 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.","https://academic.oup.com/jbmr/article-pdf/27/5/1080/56561969/1552_ftp.pdf",""

According to a goal-validation perspective, primes should cause changes in one’s motivational state to the extent people have confidence in the prime-related mental content. Across three experiments, we provided the first direct empirical evidence for this goal-validation account. Using a variety of goal priming manipulations (cooperation vs. competition, achievement, and self-improvement vs. saving money) and validity inductions (power, ease, and writing about confidence), we demonstrated that the impact of goal primes on behavior occurs to a greater extent when conditions foster confidence (vs. doubt) in mental contents. Indeed, when conditions foster doubt, goal priming effects are eliminated or counter to the implications of the prime. The implications of these findings for research on goal priming and validation processes are discussed.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0146167212458328",""

The results suggest that antecedents to adult behaviours might be a common feature of developing organisms.

Existing XPO1-targeting agents lack selectivity and have been associated with significant toxicity. Small molecule selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINEs) were designed that specifically inhibit XPO1. Genetic experiments and X-ray structures demonstrate that SINE covalently bind to a cysteine residue in the cargo-binding groove of XPO1, thereby inhibiting nuclear export of cargo proteins. The clinical relevance of SINEs was explored in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a disease associated with recurrent XPO1 mutations. Evidence is presented that SINEs can restore normal regulation to the majority of the dysregulated pathways in CLL both in vitro and in vivo and induce apoptosis of CLL cells with a favorable therapeutic index, with enhanced killing of genomically high-risk CLL cells that are typically unresponsive to traditional therapies. More importantly, SINE slows disease progression, and improves overall survival in the Eμ-TCL1-SCID mouse model of CLL with minimal weight loss or other toxicities. Together, these findings demonstrate that XPO1 is a valid target in CLL with minimal effects on normal cells and provide a basis for the development of SINEs in CLL and related hematologic malignancies.","http://ashpublications.org/blood/article-pdf/120/23/4621/1361381/zh804912004621.pdf",""

Although most patients respond to platinum-based chemotherapy, relapses are common, leading to platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, which is uniformly fatal. Similar to other malignancies, ovarian cancer progression is associated with transcriptional deregulation and such changes contribute to ovarian cancer progression and development of resistance to chemotherapy. In an effort to better understand the causes of acquired platinum resistance in ovarian cancer, we performed whole transcriptome analysis of platinum sensitive and resistant ovarian cancer cell lines. We used RNA-sequencing to identify candidate genes and pathways that contribute to platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. We detected altered mRNA expression of transcription factors (DMRT3, DMRT1, GATA1, EMX2, LHX1, SRY, SOX9, FOXL2, LHX9) and signaling pathway genes (RXFP2, AR, WT1, FGF9, RSPO1, TUSC3, NROB1, WNT4). Additionally, significant up regulation (&gt;20 fold increase) of the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) HOTAIR and HOTTIP, which direct polycomb group and trithorax complexes to HOX promoters, was detected. We observed elevated HoxA gene expression (&gt; 100 fold in some cases) associated with increased HOTTIP lncRNA expression in the platinum resistant cells. Altered expression of genes associated with DNA methylation (DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, DNMT3L MECP2, MBD3L1, MBD6, MBD2, MBD3L2, MBD5, MBD1, MBD3, MBD4) was also observed. Furthermore, the splicing patterns of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in platinum resistant cells were altered, resulting in splice variants lacking functional coding regions. Altered BRCA1 and BRCA2 splicing patterns were correlated with reduced expression levels for numerous splicing factors (A2BP1, PTBP1, RBM9, SFRS3, ARID3A, ARID3B, SF1). DNA methylation analysis indicated epigenetic derepression consistent with increased expression for gonad developmental genes (HOTAIR, HOTTIP, HOXA genes). Our data suggest that genes associated ovarian development and differentiation contribute to the development of platinum resistant ovarian cancer. We are currently conducting integrated data and bioinformatics analyses to further investigate changes found in platinum resistance.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/72/8_Supplement/4188/581122/Abstract-4188-Whole-transcriptome-analyses-of",""

We also tested gender differences in these relationships. Results indicated that for women, the relationship between gender discrimination (e.g., unequal access to resources) and job satisfaction was mediated by scholarly alienation and a negative workplace climate; gender derogation (e.g., disparaging comments) was related to organizational sexism toward women (OSTW), which was associated with perceptions of scholarly alienation and a negative workplace climate; these perceptions in turn predicted lower job satisfaction. For men, gender derogation was indirectly related to job satisfaction via scholarly alienation, and OSTW was indirectly related to job satisfaction via both climate variables. Analyses indicated that most of these indirect effects were stronger for women than men. We discuss these results for both sexes and suggest reasons why men’s climate perceptions may be “chilled” by exposure to sexism toward women.

Methods: With data retrieved from the first three waves (2001–05) of the National Longitudinal Transition Study–2, the correlational study focused on secondary school students with a primary disability of visual impairment who were capable of taking standardized tests. The unweighted sample sizes ranged from 210 to 280. The relationships between using a computer for homework and for the Internet and students’ performance on standardized tests on synonyms and antonyms, comprehension of passages, calculation, applied problems, science, and social studies were investigated using multiple regression analyses, with other variables held constant, including gender, severity of vision loss, household income, multiple disability status, and race or ethnicity. Results: When gender, the severity of vision loss, household income, multiple disability status, and race or ethnicity were held constant, using a computer for the Internet had a significant positive relationship with students’ performances on the passage comprehension test (p = .034), calculation test (p = .027), and science test (p = .000). However, using a computer for homework had no significant relationship with students’ performances in any of the six tests that were examined. Discussion: Students who used a computer for the Internet scored significantly higher than did those who did not on the passage comprehension, calculation, and science tests. But students who used a computer for homework performed at the same level as those who did not on all six tests that were examined. Implications for practitioners: Internet use by secondary school students with visual impairments may be beneficial to the students’ performance on passage comprehension, calculation, and science tests and therefore should be encouraged. Special assistance for students from low-income families, whose rate of Internet use was significantly lower than those from high-income families, should be considered.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0145482X1210601005",""

The current study aims to investigate this unexplored avenue of research and to identify the influences on parental attitudes toward children walking and bicycling to school as part of a larger nationwide effort to make children more physically active and combat rising trends of childhood obesity in the United States. Through the use of a multivariate ordered response model (a model structure that allows different attitudes to be correlated), the current study analyzes five parental attitudes toward children walking and bicycling to school on the basis of data drawn from the California add-on sample of the 2009 National Household Travel Survey. In particular, the subsample from the Los Angeles–Riverside–Orange County area is used in this study to take advantage of a rich set of microaccessibility measures that are available for this region. It is found that school accessibility, work patterns, current mode use in the household, and sociodemographic characteristics shape parental attitudes toward children walking and bicycling to school. The study findings provide insights on policies, strategies, and campaigns that may help shift parental attitudes to be more favorable toward children walking and bicycling to school.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/2323-06",""

We examined charge-defined VLDL subfractions in metabolic syndrome (MetS) to determine whether their increased electronegativity is associated with increased cytotoxicity and whether high concentrations of highly electronegative subfractions render VLDL harmful to the vascular endothelium. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma VLDL of normal individuals (control subjects) (n = 13) and of those with MetS (n = 13) was resolved into subfractions with increasing negative charge (V1–V5) by anion-exchange chromatography. Human aortic endothelial cells were treated with V1–V5 or unfractionated VLDL. RESULTS: Compared with the control subjects, individuals with MetS had a significantly higher percentage of V5 VLDL (V5/VLDL%) (34 ± 20 vs. 39 ± 11%, respectively; P &lt; 0.05) and plasma V5 concentration ([V5]) (5.5 ± 4.4 vs. 15.2 ± 8.5 mg/dL, respectively; P &lt; 0.001). Apolipoprotein (apo)B100 levels decreased and apoC levels increased from V1 to V5, indicating that V5 is apoC-rich VLDL. Regression analyses of all 26 individuals showed that [V5] was positively correlated with total cholesterol (P = 0.016), triglyceride (P &lt; 0.000001), and V5/VLDL% (P = 0.002). Fasting plasma glucose, but not waist circumference, exhibited a positive trend (P = 0.058); plasma HDL cholesterol exhibited a weak inverse trend (P = 0.138). V5 (10 μg/mL) induced apoptosis in ~50% of endothelial cells in 24 h. V5 was the most rapidly (&lt;15 min) internalized subfraction and induced the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in endothelial cells after 20 min. Unfractionated MetS VLDL, but not control VLDL, also induced ROS production and endothelial cell apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: In populations with increased risk of diabetes, the vascular endothelium is constantly exposed to VLDL that contains a high proportion of V5. The potential impact of V5-rich VLDL warrants further investigation.","https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/35/3/648/610824/648.pdf",""

We show that nanofeatures with lateral dimensions smaller than λ/20 can be observed in the surface emission (SE) images of plasmonic crystals with a period of 300 nm. Moreover, as a proof‐of‐concept, we demonstrate that SPP tomography permits to resolve two single objects with a center‐to‐center separation of 200 nm and edge‐to‐edge separation as small as λ/7. We present a comprehensive discussion about the nanoimaging capabilities of the SPP tomography technique. In contrast to other optical subwavelength resolution techniques, in our approach for imaging nanosize features, enhanced evanescent waves are coupled to the far‐field via leakage radiation associated with SPPs excited by near‐field fluorescence; therefore wide‐field images, which are not out‐of‐plane diffraction‐limited, are formed directly in the microscope's camera. We also discuss additional imaging processing capabilities associated with the fact that SPP tomography SE images are formed by the microscope lenses through an analog tomography process.

The present study was undertaken to determine the effects of BRB ACs on human colon cancer cells in vitro. Three days of AC treatment at 5 and 25 μg/ml medium significantly decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in HCT116, Caco2, and SW480 human colon cancer cell lines. The ACs also reduced the activities and protein expression levels of DNA methyltransferases 1 and 3 (DNMT1, DNMT3) in all three cell lines. Promoter methylation of p16 (CDKN2A) and the Wnt pathway inhibitors, Sfrp2, Sfrp5 and Wif1, was decreased by AC treatment resulting in increased mRNA expression levels of all three Wnt inhibitors. ACs did not alter global methylation LINE-1. DNMT1 and DNMT3B knockout (KO) HCT116 cells were generated using siRNA to determine the role of these methyltransferases in AC-induced demethylation. In DNMT1 KO cells, the promoter methylation of Sfrp5 was reduced when compared with wild type HCT116 cells. AC treatment further reduced promoter methylation of Sfrp5 in DNMT1 KO cells suggesting that the ACs targeted protein(s) other than DNMT1 to regulate methylation. Promoter methylation of Sfrp5 was decreased to almost zero by treatment of DNMT3B KO cells with ACs. Interestingly, promoter methylation of p16 was reduced in both DNMT1 and DNMT3B KO cells, and AC treatment further reduced p16 methylation in both lines. In conclusion, these results suggest that ACs demethylated and reactivated tumor suppressor genes through regulation of DNMT1 and DNMT3B.

In order to infer limb bone growth patterns in non‐avian dinosaurs, this correlation needs to be documented in crocodilians. We tested the LGR‐CCC correlation in femora of juvenile alligators raised for two years under laboratory conditions, and injected with fluorochrome dyes (alizarin, calcein). Some alligators were constrained to in‐series circulation by left aortic ablation (n=24), whereas sham‐operated controls retained in‐parallel circulation (n=36). Animals either remained sedentary or were subjected to rigorous walking or swimming exercise (n=20). We found CCC correlated with LGR and was significantly augmented (+36%) in alligators with in‐series circulation compared to those with in‐parallel circulation. Exhaustive exercise reduced thickness (−15%) of the distal, but not proximal, growth plate, suggesting local effect of biomechanic loading. We propose loss of the pulmonary bypass shunt results in higher systemic arterial oxygen tension, which allows for greater oxygen diffusion distance through the growth plate. Among archosaur ancestors, thicker growth plates may have appeared concurrently with the origin of in‐series circulation, and thus set the stage for later acquisition of fast growth and endothermic metabolism.

We performed a retrospective study (January 1, 2008–December 31, 2009) of all patients with TBI and coagulopathy (international normalized ratio (INR) > 1.5) transferred to our Level I trauma center. Twenty-three patients with coagulopathy and TBI were transferred to our trauma center, 100 per cent sustained a fall, and 100 per cent were taking warfarin at the time of injury. Ten patients received VIIa to correct coagulopathy before transfer, whereas 13 did not. The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes in patients who received VIIa with those who did not. When comparing the VIIa group with the no-VIIa group there was no difference in age, gender, Glasgow Coma Scale score, injury severity score, transfer time, or INR at outlying facility. Both groups received one unit of plasma before arrival at our trauma center; patients in the VIIa group received a single 1.2 mg dose of VIIa at the outlying facility. Upon arrival to our trauma center the VIIa group had a lower INR (1.0 vs 3.0, P = 0.02) and lower mortality (0% vs 39%, P = 0.03). In coagulopathic patients with TBI presenting to outlying institutions with limited resources to quickly provide plasma, VIIa efficiently corrects coagulopathy before transfer to definitive care at the regional trauma center.

Three days of AC treatment at 5 and 25 μg/ml medium significantly decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in HCT116, Caco2, and SW480 human colon cancer cell lines. The ACs also reduced the activities and protein expression levels of DNA methyltransferases 1 and 3 (DNMT1, DNMT3) in all three cell lines. Promoter methylation of p16 (CDKN2A) and the Wnt pathway inhibitors, Sfrp2, Sfrp5 and Wif1, was decreased by AC treatment resulting in increased mRNA expression levels of all three Wnt inhibitors. ACs did not alter global methylation LINE-1. DNMT1 and DNMT3B knockout (KO) HCT116 cells were generated using siRNA to determine the role of these methyltransferases in AC-induced demethylation.

Little research has addressed this area; therefore, the purpose of the study presented here was to identify the teachers’ self-reported possession of knowledge of and skills in assistive technology. Method: The participants completed an online survey rating their level of expertise in assistive technology. The researchers used descriptive statistics and Pearson r correlation coefficients. Results: In total, 840 teachers of students with visual impairments in the United States, Palau, and the Virgin Islands completed an online survey to identify their perceived level of mastery of assistive technology competencies. Regarding the participants’ confidence in teaching and supporting the use of assistive technology for students with visual impairments, 40.7% of the participants were confident or very confident, whereas 59.3% reported no to some confidence. In addition, the younger teachers were relatively more confident in teaching assistive technology than were the older teachers. Specifically, the participants felt the least confident with the foundations domain of assistive technology and the most confident with collaboration. Discussion: The results describe teachers’ self-perceptions and pinpoint areas for further intervention and dialogue. Personnel preparation programs and in-service training programs can concentrate on these specific areas of assistive technology to improve teachers’ levels of confidence with assistive technology domains. Collaborating to create systemic, national interventions is crucial for improving educational and vocational outcomes for all individuals with visual impairments. Implications for practitioners: First, given the findings of the study, it is recommended that all university programs develop a course on assistive technology, as well as embed assistive technology competencies in their training curricula. Second, research is needed to explore further what universities are currently doing to address assistive technology in their curricula. Finally, professional organizations should provide ongoing in-service training in assistive technology for practicing teachers of students with visual impairments.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0145482X1210601010",""

Since PtdIns(4,5)P2 resides in raft domains and DHA can alter the size of rafts, we hypothesized that PtdIns(4,5)P2 and downstream actin remodelling are perturbed by the incorporation of n−3 PUFA into membranes, resulting in suppressed T-cell activation. CD4+ T-cells isolated from Fat-1 transgenic mice (membranes enriched in n−3 PUFA) exhibited a 50% decrease in PtdIns(4,5)P2. Upon activation by plate-bound anti-CD3/anti-CD28 or PMA/ionomycin, Fat-1 CD4+ T-cells failed to metabolize PtdIns(4,5)P2. Furthermore, actin remodelling failed to initiate in Fat-1 CD4+ T-cells upon stimulation; however, the defect was reversed by incubation with exogenous PtdIns(4,5)P2. When Fat-1 CD4+ T-cells were stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28-coated beads, WASP (Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein) failed to translocate to the immunological synapse. The suppressive phenotype, consisting of defects in PtdIns(4,5)P2 metabolism and actin remodelling, were recapitulated in CD4+ T-cells isolated from mice fed on a 4% DHA triacylglycerol-enriched diet. Collectively, these data demonstrate that n−3 PUFA, such as DHA, alter PtdIns(4,5)P2 in CD4+ T-cells, thereby suppressing the recruitment of WASP to the immunological synapse, and impairing actin remodelling in CD4+ T-cells.","https://portlandpress.com/biochemj/article-pdf/443/1/27/666109/bj4430027.pdf",""

The authors present an angle-resolved near-edge x-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy investigation of single-layered graphene transferred to 300 nm SiO2/Si with subsequent deposition of ultrathin high-κ dielectric layers to form graphene/dielectric interfaces. The authors’ NEXAFS studies indicate the appearance of a distinct pre-edge absorption for graphene/HfO2 heterostructures (but not for comparable TiO2 and ZrO2 constructs). The hole doping of graphene with substantial redistribution of electron density to the interfacial region is proposed as the origin of the pre-edge feature as electron depletion renders part of the initially occupied density of states accessible for observation via NEXAFS spectroscopy. The spectral assignment is validated by calculating the NEXAFS spectra of electron- and hole-doped graphene using density functional theory. In contrast, a similarly sputtered metallic TiN layer shows substantial covalent interfacial hybridization with graphene.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-pdf/doi/10.1116/1.4726508/16077086/041205_1_online.pdf",""

A well-known popular solution to fulfill this requirement was to allocate additional bandwidth, which unfortunately is not anymore viable due to radio-frequency (RF) spectrum scarcity. Nonetheless, spectrum measurements around the globe have revealed the fact that the available spectrum is under-utilized. One of the most remarkable solutions to cope with the under-utilization of spectrum is the concept of cognitive radio (CR). In CR systems, the main implementation issues are spectrum sensing because of the uncertainties in propagation channel, hidden primary user (PU) problem, sensing duration and security issues. Hence, the accuracy and reliability of the spectrum sensing information can be suspicious and questionable inherently. There has been no study to date that investigates the impacts of absence of spectrum sensing information in CR networks. In this work, due to the imprecise and unreliable spectrum sensing information, we investigate the performance of an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based (4G and beyond) CR spectrum sharing communication system that assumes random allocation and absence of the PU's channel occupation information, i.e., no spectrum sensing is employed to acquire information about the availability of unused subcarriers or the PU's activity. The results show that due to the lack of information of the PUs' activities, the SU randomly allocates the subcarriers of the primary network and collides with the PUs' subcarriers with a certain probability. The number of subcarrier collisions is found to be following hypergeometric distribution. The SU's capacity with subcarrier collisions is employed as a performance measure to investigate the proposed random allocation scheme for both general and Rayleigh channel fading models. To avoid the subcarrier collisions at the SUs due to the random allocation and to obtain the maximum sum rate for SUs based on the available subcarriers, an efficient centralized sequential algorithm is proposed and analyzed. The performance of such a communication set-up can provide various insights into the studies in the CR literature, and it these be utilized as a valid candidates for performance comparison benchmarks in CR spectrum sharing systems with the availability of spectrum sensing information.","",""

Of the positional candidate genes, we selected IRS1 and resequenced its 2-kb promoter region and exons for sequence variants in 32 subjects. A total of 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified. To comprehensively cover the 59-kb-long intron-1, eight additional tagging SNPs were selected from the HapMap. All the 19 SNPs were genotyped by TaqMan Assay in the entire data set (N = 670; 39 families). Association analyses between the SNPs and GFR and type 2 diabetes–related traits were performed using the measured genotype approach. Of the SNPs examined for association, only the Gly(972)Arg variant of IRS1 exhibited a significant association with GFR (P = 0.0006) and serum triglycerides levels (P = 0.003), after accounting for trait-specific covariate effects. Carriers of Arg972 had significantly decreased GFR values. Gly(972)Arg contributed to 26% of the linkage signal on 2q. Expression of IRS1 mutant Arg972 in human mesangial cells significantly reduced the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS1 and Akt kinase. Taken together, the data provide the first evidence that genetic variation in IRS1 may influence variation in GFR probably through impaired insulin receptor signaling.","https://journals.org/diabetes/diabetes/article-pdf/61/9/2385/560654/2385.pdf",""

New hybrid nuclear/computed tomography (CT) imaging techniques elucidate a combination of wound infection parameters not previously evaluated as outcome prognosticators. Our aim is to determine if a novel standardized hybrid image–based scoring system, Composite Severity Index (CSI), has prognostic value in DFI. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Masked retrospective 99mTc-white blood cell (WBC) single photon emission CT (SPECT)/CT image interpretation and independent chart review of 77 patients (101 feet) suspected of DFI-associated osteomyelitis at a large municipal hospital between January 2007 and July 2009. CSI scores were correlated with probability of favorable outcome (no subsequent amputation/readmission after therapeutic intervention) during median 342-day follow-up. RESULTS: CSI ranged from 0–13. Receiver operating characteristic accuracy for predicting favorable outcome was 0.79 (optimal cutoff CSI, ≤2; odds ratio of therapeutic failure for CSI &gt;2, 15.1 [95% CI 4.4–51.5]). CSI of 0 had a 92% chance of favorable outcome, which fell progressively to 25% as indices rose to ≥7. Image-based osteomyelitis versus no osteomyelitis assessment was less accurate than CSI at predicting outcome (P = 0.016). In patients with intermediate severity (CSI 3–6), treatment failure decreased from 68 to 36% when antibiotic duration was extended to ≥42 days (P = 0.026).

The central objective is to reduce shoulder-bed effects on the measurements. This approach is possible because of a recently developed technique to accurately and efficiently simulate borehole density measurements. The inversion-based interpretation method consists of first detecting bed boundaries from short-spacing detector or bottom-quadrant compensated density by calculating their variance, representative of the measurement inflection point, within a sliding window. Subsequently, a correlation algorithm calculates dip and azimuth from the density image. Depth shifts that vary azimuthally and depend on relative dip angle, together with the effective penetration length of each sensor, refine previously selected bed boundaries. Next, the inversion method combines sector-based density measurements acquired at all measurement points along the well trajectory to estimate layer-by-layer densities. In the presence of standoff, the method excludes upper sectors most affected by standoff to reduce inaccuracies due to borehole mud. To verify the reliability and applicability of the inversion method, we first use forward simulations to generate synthetic density images for a model constructed from field data. Results indicate that inversion improves the interpretation of azimuthal density data as it consistently reduces shoulder-bed effects. Inversion results obtained from field measurements are appraised by quantifying the corresponding integrated porosity-meter yielded by inversion methods in comparison to standard techniques that use simple cutoffs on field-processed compensated density. Integrated porosity-meter of inverted synthetic density measurements increases by 4.6% with respect to noninverted field measurements. Also, integrated porosity-meter obtained from inversion results that include only bottom sectors improved by 65.4% with respect to that calculated with field-compensated, bottom-quadrant density measurements.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/geo2012-0002.1",""

Studies indicate that the spectrum is being under-utilized. As a promising solution, cognitive radio (CR) is an encouraging candidate to achieve more efficient RF spectrum utilization. The previous studies motivate us to utilize the dynamic channel fading model (hyper-fading) to perform a unified analysis for CR multiple-access channel (CR-MAC) networks. Since the nature of the CR networks is multiuser communication, deliberating CR-MAC is more pertinent than point-to-point communication systems. The objective is to maximize the capacity of CR-MAC network over hyper-fading channels under both secondary user's (SU's) transmit power (TP) and interference temperature (IT) constraints. Multiple SUs transmit to the secondary base station under the TP and IT constraints. In order to perform a general analysis, a theoretical dynamic fading model termed hyper-fading model, which is suitable to the dynamic nature of cognitive radio channel, is considered. The optimal power allocation method (water-filling) is employed to maximize the capacity of CR-MAC for hyper-fading channel with TP and IT constraints. Throughout the results, the capacity of the hyper-fading channels are compared with that of other channel fading models such as Rayleigh, Nakagami-2, and with an AWGN channel. Furthermore, the impact of the number of SUs on capacity is investigated. Numerical results along with relevant discussions for capacity measure under AWGN, and Rayleigh, Nakagami-2 and hyper-fading channel models are provided to compare the behavior of CR-MAC in these environments. The results reveal that in the case of very strict IT constraint the water-filling method gives good capacity improvements. This benefit is lost when the IT constraint is relaxed. Through comparison of hyper-fading with other fading environments, it is found that the hyper-fading channel fills the gap in the capacity profiles obtained from the other channel fading types. Further, a study of such a CR-MAC system that undergoes a hyper-fading model can provide unified and comprehensive insights on performance analysis of the CR networks.","",""

As a result, MP-12 encoded 4, 9, and 10 mutations in the S, M, and L segments, respectively. Among them, mutations in the M and L segments were responsible for attenuation, while the MP-12 S segment still encoded a virulent phenotype. We performed high-throughput sequencing of MP-12 vaccine, ZH548, and recombinant MP-12 (rMP-12) viruses. We found that rMP-12 contains very low numbers of viral subpopulations, while MP-12 and ZH548 contain 2 to 4 times more viral genetic subpopulations than rMP-12. MP-12 genetic subpopulations did not encode the ZH548 sequence at the 23 MP-12 consensus mutations. On the other hand, 4 and 2 mutations in M and L segments of MP-12 were found in ZH548 subpopulations. Thus, those 6 mutations were no longer MP-12-specific mutations. ZH548 encoded several unique mutations compared to other Egyptian strains, i.e., strains ZH501, ZH1776, and ZS6365. ZH548 subpopulations shared nucleotides at the mutation site common with those in the Egyptian strains, while MP-12 subpopulations did not share those nucleotides. Thus, MP-12 retains unique genetic subpopulations and has no evidence of reversion to the ZH548 sequence in the subpopulations. This study provides the first information regarding the genetic subpopulations of RVFV and shows the genetic stability of the MP-12 vaccine manufactured in MRC-5 cells.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.02081-12",""

Real-time confocal microscopy of cultured primary hepatocytes from gene-ablated (L-FABP, SCP-2/SCP-x, and L-FABP/SCP-2/SCP-x null) mice showed that the loss of L-FABP reduced cellular uptake of 12- N-methyl-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazo)-aminostearic acid (a fluorescent-saturated LCFA analog) by ∼50%. Importantly, nuclear targeting of the LCFA was enhanced when L-FABP was upregulated (SCP-2/SCP-x null) but was significantly reduced when L-FABP was ablated (L-FABP null), thus impacting LCFA nuclear targeting. These effects were not associated with a net decrease in expression of key membrane proteins involved in LCFA or glucose transport. Since hepatic LCFA uptake and metabolism are closely linked to glucose uptake, the effect of glucose on L-FABP-mediated LCFA uptake and nuclear targeting was examined. Increasing concentrations of glucose decreased cellular LCFA uptake and even more extensively decreased LCFA nuclear targeting. Loss of L-FABP exacerbated the decrease in LCFA nuclear targeting, while loss of SCP-2 reduced the glucose effect, resulting in enhanced LCFA nuclear targeting compared with control. Simply, ablation of L-FABP decreases LCFA uptake and even more extensively decreases its nuclear targeting.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpgi.00489.2011",""

The interactions between hydrophilic PEO/PU and hydrophobic PDMS, as it cross-links, result into PEO/PU pushed out of the bulk PDMS. As this occurs, PEO/PU particles leave behind their tracks. PEO depicts ease of handling, better inherent alignment, and excellent repeatability. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, optical/confocal laser scanning microscopy, and fluid flow measurements are done to characterize the microfluidic channels. These channels have a circular cross-section and are parallel to each other. PEO generates smaller channels compared to PU. The diameter, arrangement, and height of these channels are seen to depend on temperature; for example, channel length increases linearly with temperature. An interdependent relationship between temperature, pore size, and number of pores is also exhibited. During phase separation of hydrophilic and hydrophobic materials, interface shows concentric circular arrangements of hydrophilic molten polymer. The circular pattern shows almost similar radial change in size. The flow behavior of colored ink solutions shows higher velocity at the entrance of microchannels which decreases to sustained lower velocity as fluid travels farther in the microchannels. The fabrication of membrane does not need lithography or etching, and channels are self-assembled from bottom-up interactions. These microchannel membranes can have applications in drug delivery, cell culture studies, mixing of solutions, separation of mixtures, lab-on-a-chip, etc.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.4729526/13452567/024701_1_online.pdf",""

The approach is particularly well-suited for the calibration of high-resolution reservoir properties (permeability) because the field-scale seismic data are areally dense, whereas the production data are effectively averaged over interwell spacing. The joint calibration procedure is performed using streamline-based sensitivities derived from finite-difference flow simulation. The inverted seismic data (i.e., changes in elastic impedance or fluid saturations) are distributed as a 3D high-resolution grid cell property. The sensitivities of the seismic and production surveillance data to perturbations in absolute permeability at individual grid cells are efficiently computed via semianalytical streamline techniques. We generalize previous formulations of streamline-based seismic inversion to incorporate realistic field situations such as changing boundary conditions due to infill drilling, pattern conversion, etc. A commercial finite-difference flow simulator is used for reservoir simulation and to generate the time-dependent velocity fields through which streamlines are traced and the sensitivity coefficients are computed. The commercial simulator allows us to incorporate detailed physical processes including compressibility and nonconvective forces, e.g., capillary pressure effects, while the streamline trajectories provide a rapid evaluation of the sensitivities. The efficacy of our proposed approach was tested with synthetic and field applications. The synthetic example was the Society of Petroleum Engineers benchmark Brugge field case. The field example involves waterflooding of a North Sea reservoir with multiple seismic surveys. In both cases, the advantages of incorporating the time-lapse variations were clearly demonstrated through improved estimation of the permeability heterogeneity, fluid saturation evolution, and swept and drained volumes. The value of the seismic data integration was in particular proven through the identification of the continuity in reservoir sands and barriers, and by the preservation of geologic realism in the calibrated model.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/geo2011-0346.1",""

Although these tests have been traditionally performed in the reversed Trendelenburg (RT) position, recent mandates from The Intersocietal Commission for the Accreditation of Vascular Laboratories and some insurance providers require that patients be evaluated for reflux in the standing position (SP). The purpose of this study was to determine whether performing venous duplex in the SP versus RT position adds information that affects patient treatment. Methods: Twenty-eight subjects (25 women; mean age of 52 years) with signs and symptoms of venous insufficiency were evaluated prospectively with the use of ultrasound imaging and Doppler in the 5- to 8-MHz ranges. The great saphenous vein (GSV) was evaluated for each limb from below the knee to the saphenofemoral junction. Patients were initially evaluated at 15–25 degrees of RT position. Reflux was defined by reversal of flow for >0.5 seconds via use of the Valsalva and/or manual compression maneuvers. The GSV was measured in A-P diameter at the saphenofemoral junction and at the knee level. The subjects were then elevated to SP and measurements were repeated while the limb was in a nonweight-bearing position. Results: A total of 52 limbs were evaluated for venous reflux in 28 study subjects. The mean lower-extremity CEAP score was 3 SD ± 3. Twenty-six (50%) GSVs were positive for venous reflux in the RT position. Of these GSVs, three were negative for reflux in SP. Twenty-seven (53%) GSVs were positive for venous reflux in SP; however, four of these GSVs were negative for reflux in RT. The median difference in reflux time from RT to SP was 0.15 seconds (interquartile range 0–3.8 seconds and 0–2.7seconds, respectively, p = 0.02). The mean difference in GSV diameter from RT to SP was 0.7 mm (±0.96 mm SD, p < 0.0001). These results changed the clinical course for one subject who did not have reflux in RT but did in SP (3.5%, p = 0.085). Conclusion: The results from evaluating subjects in SP were not independently associated with a change in clinical outcome. However, 15% of GSVs negative for reflux in RT were positive for reflux in the SP. As a result, 3.5% of subjects in our study had a change in clinical course as the result of evaluation of the GSV in SP. This finding suggests that failure to identify GSV reflux in RT in patients with signs and symptoms of venous insufficiency may be an indication to evaluate the GSV in SP.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/154431671203600103",""

Much of the relative motion of particles within a shear band is accompanied by rolling, as opposed to sliding, since the latter requires more dissipative work. However, in a densely packed assembly, rolling cannot be accomplished without some sliding. This dissipative constraint implies a characteristic rotation transmission distance, i.e., the distance to which the information about rotation of a particle propagates. Here, we use the discrete element method to investigate this length and its directional dependence as function of the force chain network. We found that the rotation transmission distance correlates with the shear band width observed in experiments and previous numerical simulations. It is strongly dependent on the particle size distribution and the coefficient of interparticle friction, and weakly dependent on pressure. Moreover, the transmission of rotations is strongly directionally dependent following the pattern of force chains. To describe this dependence, we define a nonlocal tensorial description of force chain directionality.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/appliedmechanics/article-pdf/doi/10.1115/1.4005887/5690144/031011_1.pdf",""

This study focuses on the potential vorticity signals associated with three major dynamical processes occurring in the vicinity of the Pacific–Antarctic Ridge: 1) the strong flow of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), 2) lateral eddy stirring, and 3) heat and stratification changes in bottom waters induced by hydrothermal vents. These processes result in southward and downstream advection of low potential vorticity along rising isopycnal surfaces. Using δ3He released from the hydrothermal vents, the influence of volcanic activity on the SPBW may be traced across the South Pacific along the path of the ACC to Drake Passage. SPBW also flows within the southern limb of the Ross Gyre, reaching the Antarctic Slope in places and contributes via entrainment to the formation of Antarctic Bottom Water. Finally, it is shown that the magnitude and location of the potential vorticity signals associated with SPBW have endured over at least the last two decades, and that they are unique to the South Pacific sector.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jpo/article-pdf/42/12/2153/4518458/jpo-d-12-019_1.pdf",""

Results:: Thirty-six patients were evaluated, with renal abscesses found in all age groups. The median age was 9.3 years, and 64% of patients affected were female. Fever and abdominal pain were the most common clinical symptoms. A premorbid genitourinary condition was present in 31% of patients. Previous urinary tract infection was documented in 31% of the cases. Initial elevation of C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate, when obtained, was observed in &gt;80% of cases. Abnormal urinalysis was recognized in two-thirds of encounters. Escherichia coli, the most common microorganism isolated, was found in half the cases. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 11%. Ultrasound and computed tomography were the most used diagnostic imaging modalities.

Conclusions:: Ten of the 14 patients with an abscess size ≥3 cm had an invasive intervention, but only 1 of these 10 had an initial 48-hour trial of antibiotics alone.

The control of the interfacial chemistry between a high-k dielectric and III-V materials presents a formidable challenge compared to that surmounted by Si-based technologies. The bonding configuration is obviously more complicated for a compound semiconductor, and thus an enhanced propensity to form interfacial defects is anticipated, as well as the need for surface passivation methods to mitigate such defects. In this work, we outline our recent results using in-situ methods to study the ALD high-k/III-V interface. We begin by briefly summarizing our results for III-As compounds, and then further discuss recent work on III-P and III-Sb compounds.

InP is under consideration for quantum well channel MOS structures in order to serve as a better nMOS channel interface.

These data are a rich source of information about the biological systems they represent. For example, time-series metabolic data can be used to construct dynamic genetic regulatory network models, which can be used not only to better understand the interactions among different genes inside a cell, but also to design intervention strategies that can cure or manage major diseases. Also, copy number data can be used to determine the locations and extent of aberrations in chromosome sequences which are associated with many diseases such as cancer. Unfortunately, measured biological data are usually contaminated with errors that mask the important features in the data. Therefore, noisy biological measurements need to be filtered to enhance their usefulness in practice. Conventional linear low-pass filtering techniques are widely used because they are computationally efficient and can be implemented online. However, they are not effective because they operate on a single scale, meaning that they define a specific frequency, above which all features are considered noise. Real biological data possesses multiscale characteristics, i.e., may contain important features having high frequencies (such as sharp changes) or noise occurring at low frequencies (such as correlated or colored noise). Filtering such data requires multiscale filtering techniques that can account for the multiscale nature of the data. In this work, different batch as well as online multiscale filtering techniques are used to denoise biological data. These techniques include standard multiscale (SMS) filtering, online multiscale (OLMS) filtering, translation invariant (TI) filtering, and boundary corrected TI (BCTI) filtering. The performances of these techniques are demonstrated and compared to those of some conventional low-pass filters (such as the mean filter and the exponentially weighted moving average filter) using two case studies. The first case study uses simulated dynamic metabolic data, while the second case study uses real copy number data. Simulation results show that significant improvement can be achieved using multiscale filtering over conventional filtering techniques.","",""

Despite these important issues, the mean IBL structure at the coastline during landfall is poorly understood. Knowledge of the vertical kinematic structure within tropical cyclones over water has improved greatly through aircraft reconnaissance missions and the advent of GPS dropsondes and stepped frequency microwave radiometers. Unfortunately, reconnaissance and research aircraft are limited to overwater missions, resulting in a poor understanding of vertical kinematic structure near the coastal interface, where changes in IBL structure are expected due to changes in surface roughness. Composite single- and dual-Doppler radar observations collected by the Shared Mobile Atmospheric Research and Teaching Radars during the landfall of Hurricane Frances (2004) are presented. Data analyses from the Cape Canaveral, Florida, region reveal a pronounced IBL throughout the data collection period. As a result, significant variability in the analyzed wind speed and direction are found across and near the coastal interface. IBL height is found to be suppressed when compared to an accepted empirical growth model, while multiple abrupt roughness transitions associated with the Cape Canaveral region contribute to a complex mean IBL structure.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/waf/article-pdf/27/6/1349/4653495/waf-d-12-00014_1.pdf",""

Such transitions can be achieved by the use of drugs to act on some genes/metabolites that affect the undesirable behavior. Biological phenomena are complex processes with nonlinear dynamics that cannot be perfectly described by a mathematical model due to several challenges such as the scarcity of biological data. Therefore, the need for model-free nonlinear intervention strategies that are capable of guiding the target variables to their desired values often arises. Addressing such a need is the main focus of this work. In many applications, fuzzy systems have been found to be very useful for parameter estimation, model development and control design of nonlinear processes. In this work, a model-free fuzzy intervention strategy (that does not require a mathematical model of the biological phenomenon) is proposed to guide the target variables of biological systems to their desired values. The proposed fuzzy intervention strategy is applied to two biological models: a glycolytic-glycogenolytic pathway model and a purine metabolism pathway model. The simulation results of the two case studies show that the fuzzy intervention schemes are able to guide the target variables to their desired values. Moreover, sensitivity analyses are conducted to study the robustness of the fuzzy intervention algorithm to variations in model parameters, and contamination due to measurement noise, in the two case studies, respectively.","",""

Previously, we reported that purple potato (PP) chips suppressed the colonic inflammatory markers but did not alter feed intake/weight gain in the high‐fat diet (HFD) consuming pigs. However, no information exists if PP chips alter the systemic inflammatory markers. Elevated ratio of saturated fatty acids (SFA) to poly unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in adipose tissue of obese mice/humans leads to elevated inflammatory markers. We hypothesized that PP chips may alter mesenteric fat fatty acid profile and suppress systemic oxidative stress, and inflammatory markers compared to white potato (WP) chips in pigs consuming HFD. To test this hypothesis, obese pigs were provided with HFD containing 10/20 % PP/WP chips for 5 wks. Only PP diet (10%) suppressed oxidative stress markers (8‐isoprostane and malondialdehyde; ELISA, p < 0.05) compared to control and WP diet. Mesenteric fat free fatty acid analysis (GC) showed that PP and WP diet (10%, PP > WP) suppressed SFA and elevated PUFA compared to control. TNF‐α levels in serum were also suppressed (p < 0.05) by PP (10 and 20%) and WP (10%) diets compared to control. This suggests that PP, even after processing, might suppress oxidative stress/inflammatory markers in vivo via alterations in the fatty acid composition. Thus, consumption of colored potatoes may suppress chronic inflammation during obesity.","",""

Methods This was a cross-case comparative analysis of 3 projects designed to improve health behavior counseling in primary care practices by adding to or changing clinical support staff roles. Qualitative data (site visits notes, grantee reports, interviews with grantees, and online diary entries) were analyzed to examine instances of role change in depth, using role change theory as an organizing framework. Results Practice team members had greater success taking on new roles when patients valued the services provided. Often, it was easier to a hire a new person into a new role rather than have an existing practice member shift responsibilities. This was because new personnel had the structural autonomy, credibility, and organizational support needed to develop new responsibilities and routines. Conclusion: As primary care delivery systems are redesigned in ways that rely on new roles to deliver care, understanding how to effectively add or change staff roles is essential and requires attention to patients’, practice members’, and institutions’ support for new roles.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2150131911428338",""

Extraordinarily, the remission of type 2 diabetes occurs long before any significant weight loss. The physiological and biochemical mechanisms underlying the astonishing impact of bariatric surgery on glucose homeostasis are, however, poorly understood. Our objective is to use mathematical modeling to try to better understand the mechanisms behind type 2 diabetes remission after bariatric surgery. Methods: A general mathematical method is proposed for estimating the biochemical response to pharmaceuticals, surgeries, or other medical interventions. This method is then applied in an extremely simple model of the response to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery and related procedures. Results and Conclusions: There are clearly multiple and quite complex effects of bariatric surgeries. The results of our model confirm that the remission of type 2 diabetes after bariatric surgery can be largely explained by the enhanced post-meal excretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), an incretin that increases insulin secretion and has been shown to increase proliferation and decrease apoptosis of pancreatic beta cells, but it also suggests that other mechanisms are likely to be involved, possibly including an additional insulin-independent pathway for glucose transport into cells.","",""

Recently, a recombinant hMPV lacking the M2-2 protein (rhMPV-ΔM2-2) demonstrated reduced replication in the respiratory tract of animal models, making it a promising live vaccine candidate. However, the exact nature of the interaction between the M2-2 protein and host cells that regulates viral infection/propagation is largely unknown. By taking advantage of the available reverse genetics system and ectopic expression system for viral protein, we found that M2-2 not only promotes viral gene transcription and replication but subverts host innate immunity, therefore identifying M2-2 as a novel virulence factor, in addition to the previously described hMPV G protein. Since we have shown that the RIG-I/MAVS pathway plays an important role in hMPV-induced signaling in airway epithelial cells, we investigated whether M2-2 antagonizes the host cellular responses by targeting this pathway. Reporter gene assays and coimmunoprecipitation studies indicated that M2-2 targets MAVS, an inhibitory mechanism different from what we previously reported for hMPV G, which affects RIG-I- but not MAVS-dependent gene transcription. In addition, we found that the domains of M2-2 responsible for the regulation of viral gene transcription and antiviral signaling are different. Our findings collectively demonstrate that M2-2 contributes to hMPV immune evasion through the inhibition of MAVS-dependent cellular responses.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.01248-12",""

However, the underlying mechanisms and cellular factors involved in the process are largely uncharacterized. The viral receptor for ecotropic MLV (eMLV), a classical model for retrovirus infection mechanisms and pathogenesis, is mouse cationic amino acid transporter 1 (mCAT-1). Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) is an adaptor protein that has been shown to couple cell surface receptors, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and hepatocyte growth factor receptor, to intracellular signaling events. Here we examined if GRB2 could also play a role in controlling infection by retroviruses by affecting receptor function. The GRB2 RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated suppression of endogenous GRB2 resulted in a consistent and significant reduction of virus binding and membrane fusion. The binding between eMLV and cells promoted increased GRB2–mCAT-1 interactions, as detected by immunoprecipitation. Consistently, the increased colocalization of GRB2 and mCAT-1 signals was detected by confocal microscopy. This association was time dependent and paralleled the kinetics of cell-virus membrane fusion. Interestingly, unlike the canonical binding pattern seen for GRB2 and growth factor receptors, GRB2–mCAT-1 binding does not depend on the GRB2-SH2 domain-mediated recognition of tyrosine phosphorylation on the receptor. The inhibition of endogenous GRB2 led to a reduction in surface levels of mCAT-1, which was detected by immunoprecipitation and by a direct binding assay using a recombinant MLV envelope protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Consistent with this observation, the expression of a dominant negative GRB2 mutant (R86K) resulted in the sequestration of mCAT-1 from the cell surface into intracellular vesicles. Taken together, these findings suggest a novel role for GRB2 in ecotropic MLV entry and infection by facilitating mCAT-1 trafficking.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.05993-11",""

Methods: Subjects completed the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory–Head and Neck Module before beginning radiation therapy. Results: In all, 270 patients participated. Symptom severity and interference varied between treatment‐naïve patients and those with prior treatment. Cluster analyses revealed that 33% of patients had high symptom burden. Symptoms most often rated moderate‐to‐severe were fatigue, sleep disturbance, distress, pain, and problems chewing and swallowing. Poorer performance status, higher T classification, and receipt of previous treatment correlated with higher symptom burden. Conclusions: A substantial proportion of patients were experiencing high symptom burden. Because few interventions currently exist for several of the most problematic symptoms, research in symptom reduction that targets the pattern of symptoms described here is greatly needed. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fhed.23181",""

When testes were fixed in BF, TUNEL-stained cells were more prevalent than when fixation occurred in mDF. Independent of fixative, TUNEL-staining was higher when testes were fixed at room temperature relative to 4°C. Significant effects were present for fixative and temperature of fixation, but not their interaction. Relative to BF, mDF also provided for lower TUNEL-staining in liver, but staining was not affected by fixation temperature. Since the TUNEL assay depends on the detection of fragmented DNA strands, harsh fixatives that induce breaks in the DNA can introduce substantial artifacts. Such potential artifacts are especially prevalent in a tissue such as testes with its ongoing division and differentiation activities.

Point contact measurements were used to measure the change in the switching-field of the magnetization with the change in the bias current applied to the point contact. A larger STT effect, as evidenced by a larger change in the switching magnetic field for the unit change in the dc bias current, was observed for the sample with 45∘ tilt in magnetization compared to a sample with 12∘ tilt.

It is associated with respiratory illnesses in children, adults, and immunocompromised patients, ranging from upper respiratory tract infections to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Interferon (IFN) represents a major line of defense against virus infection, and in response, viruses have evolved countermeasures to inhibit IFN production as well as IFN signaling. Although the strategies of IFN evasion are similar, the specific mechanisms by which paramyxoviruses inhibit IFN responses are quite diverse. In this review, we will present an overview of the strategies that hMPV uses to subvert cellular signaling in airway epithelial cells, the major target of infection, as well as in primary immune cells.","https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/4/12/3551/pdf",""

However, little is known regarding miRNA regulation of muscle regeneration. Murine tibialis anterior muscle was evaluated after cardiotoxin-induced injury and used for global miRNA expression analysis. From day 1 through day 21 following injury, 298 miRNAs were significantly changed at least at one time point, including 86 miRNAs that were altered >10-fold compared with uninjured skeletal muscle. Temporal miRNA expression patterns included inflammation-related miRNAs (miR-223 and -147) that increased immediately after injury; this pattern contrasted to that of mature muscle-specific miRNAs (miR-1, -133a, and -499) that abruptly decreased following injury followed by upregulation in later regenerative events. Another cluster of miRNAs were transiently increased in the early days of muscle regeneration including miR-351, a miRNA that was also transiently expressed during myogenic progenitor cell (MPC) differentiation in vitro. Based on computational predictions, further studies demonstrated that E2f3 was a target of miR-351 in myoblasts. Moreover, knockdown of miR-351 expression inhibited MPC proliferation and promoted apoptosis during MPC differentiation, whereas miR-351 overexpression protected MPC from apoptosis during differentiation. Collectively, these observations suggest that miR-351 is involved in both the maintenance of MPC proliferation and the transition into differentiated myotubes. Thus, a novel, time-dependent sequence of molecular events during muscle regeneration has been identified; miR-351 inhibits E2f3 expression, a key regulator of cell cycle progression and proliferation, and promotes MPC proliferation and protects early differentiating MPC from apoptosis, important events in the hostile tissue environment after acute muscle injury.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/physiolgenomics.00052.2012",""

Consistent with the physical governing mechanism of the FAT hypothesis, the peak clear-sky diabatic subsidence and convergence profiles are located at roughly the same level (200 hPa) as the peak in the cloud profile, which is fundamentally determined by the rapid decrease of water vapor concentration above this level. The geographical maxima of cloud fraction agree well with those of water vapor, clear-sky cooling rates, and diabatic convergence at 200 hPa. The use of direct CTT measurements suggests the CTT in specific Pacific basins exhibit different characteristics as the frequency distribution of the tropical SST varies from boreal winter to summer. When averaging over the tropics as a whole, the CTT distributions are approximately unchanged primarily because of cancellation by the variations associated with individual regions. An analysis of the response of the tropical mean CTT anomaly time series to the SST indicates that a possible negative relationship is present, whereas the relationship tends to be positive over the tropical western Pacific and Indian Oceans. In addition, it is suggested to interpret the FAT hypothesis, and the more recent proportionately higher anvil temperature (PHAT) hypothesis, by using the temperature at the maximum cloud detrainment level instead of the CTT.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jas/article-pdf/69/7/2317/3628725/jas-d-11-0158_1.pdf",""

Endotracheal intubation frequently causes laryngeal injury, including edema, ulceration, and vocal cord immobility. These problems can complicate the immediate postextubation course. Methods. The authors measured the cuff leak and made bedside assessment of the voice in 51 patients requiring mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure. Results. The median tidal volume was 450 mL (range = 300-600 mL). The median duration of ventilation was 3 days (range = 0-19 days). The median cuff leak was 180 mL (range = −33 to 460 mL); the median percentage cuff leak was 40.9% (range = −7.75% to 99.2%). Women had significantly smaller cuff leaks (18.6% of tidal volume vs 50.3% in men, P = .01). Patients with hoarseness frequently had smaller cuff leaks (median 24.1% vs. 46.7% in nonhoarse patients). Eleven patients (84.6%, 11/13) with a cuff leak <15% had hoarseness; 14 patients (14/38) with a cuff leak >15% had hoarseness ( P = .01). Four patients had stridor, and all had a cuff leak >15% of the tidal volume. Conclusion. Patients with low cuff leak volumes are more likely to have postextubation hoarseness. This suggests that these patients have some degree of laryngeal injury and/or edema even in the absence of stridor.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1944451611433836",""

It is found that an external poloidal magnetic field, like the ones found anchored to accretion disks, is essential to stabilize the jets against current-driven instabilities. The maximum jet length before instabilities develop is proportional to the field strength and the length threshold agrees well with Kruskal-Shafranov theory. The plasma evolution is modeled qualitatively using MHD theory of current-carrying flux tubes showing that jet acceleration and collimation arise as a result of electromagnetic forces.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pop/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.3671953/15884121/012121_1_online.pdf",""

Following surgical resection and histopathologic analysis, a diagnosis of poorly differentiated small-cell NEC was made. The patient was further treated with postoperative chemotherapy, and he exhibited no evidence of recurrence or metastasis on follow-up.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/014556131209100416",""

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) contributes to the intrinsic inflammatory pathway in Barrett's esophagus. In human tumors, honokiol (a polyphenol in herbal teas) has growth-inhibitory and proapoptotic effects associated with suppressed activation of STAT3. We used human Barrett's epithelial and esophageal adenocarcinoma cell lines to determine effects of honokiol on cell number, necrosis, apoptosis, and anchorage-independent growth and to explore STAT3's role in those effects. We determined Ras activity and expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2, phosphorylated Akt, and phosphorylated STAT3 in the presence or absence of honokiol. Cells were infected with constitutively active Stat3-C to assess effects of honokiol-induced STAT3 inhibition on apoptosis. Honokiol decreased cell number and increased necrosis and apoptosis in transformed Barrett's cells, but not in nontransformed cells. In adenocarcinoma cells, honokiol also increased necrosis and apoptosis and decreased anchorage-independent growth. Within 30 min of honokiol treatment, transformed Barrett's cells decreased expression of phosphorylated STAT3; decreases in Ras activity and phosphorylated ERK1/2 expression were detected at 24 h. Infection with Stat3-C significantly reduced apoptosis after honokiol treatment. Honokiol causes necrosis and apoptosis in transformed Barrett's and esophageal adenocarcinoma cells, but not in nontransformed Barrett's cells, and the proapoptotic effects of honokiol are mediated by its inhibition of STAT3 signaling. These findings suggest a potential role for targeting the intrinsic inflammatory pathways as a therapeutic strategy to prevent Barrett's carcinogenesis.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpgi.00033.2012",""

Commonly used partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamides (HPAM) have been successfully used in the field for decades, but they hydrolyze at high temperature and eventually precipitate in the presence of high concentrations of divalent cations. This paper mainly focuses on rheology and transport behavior of scleroglucan (non-ionic polysaccharide) and N-vinylpyrrolidone (NVP)-polyacrylamide (AM) co-polymer. The rigid, rod-like, triple helical structure of scleroglucan imparts exceptional stability and its non-ionic functionality makes it insensitivity to salinity and hardness. By a different mechanism, NVP in modified HPAM protects the polymer's amide group against thermal hydrolysis, i.e., by sterically hindering the amide group. This allows maintaining high viscosity even in high salinity brines at high temperature. Both scleroglucan and NVP co- or ter-polymers show good filterability and transport properties in sandstone and carbonate cores at high temperature and in brine with high salinity and hardness. Therefore, both polymers are promising candidates for polymer flooding, surfactant-polymer flooding and alkali-surfactant-polymer flooding in hard brine at high temperature, but must be evaluated under specific reservoir conditions.","http://onepetro.org/SPEIOR/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/154294-MS/1638208/spe-154294-ms.pdf",""

Based on the present study, we have identified several advantageous features of hBN DUV photodetectors: (1) low long wavelength response or high DUV to visible rejection ratio; (2) requiring very thin active layers due to high optical absorption; (3) high dielectric strength and chemical inertness and resistance to oxidation and therefore suitable for applications in extreme conditions; (4) high prospects of achieving flexible devices; and (5) possible integration with graphene optoelectronics due to their similar structures and lattice constants.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.4764533/14256574/171112_1_online.pdf",""

In this way, right anterior cingulate (ACC), right posterior cingulate (PCC), and left precuneus (Pcun) were identified as regions uniquely active in PTSD patients relative to healthy controls. To further characterize these regions, their normal interactions, and their typical functional roles, meta‐analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) with behavioral filtering was applied. MACM indicated that the PCC and Pcun regions were frequently co‐active and associated with processing of cognitive information, particularly in explicit memory tasks.

We used an nsp1 mutant, nsp1-CD, lacking the RNA cleavage function, to delineate the mechanism of nsp1-mediated translation inhibition and identify the translation step(s) targeted by nsp1. nsp1 and nsp1-CD had identical inhibitory effects on mRNA templates that are resistant to nsp1-induced RNA cleavage, implying the validity of using nsp1-CD to dissect the translation inhibition function of nsp1. We provide evidence for a novel mode of action of nsp1. nsp1 inhibited the translation initiation step by targeting at least two separate stages: 48S initiation complex formation and the steps involved in the formation of the 80S initiation complex from the 48S complex. nsp1 had a differential, mRNA template-dependent, inhibitory effect on 48S and 80S initiation complex formation. nsp1 inhibited different steps of translation initiation on CrPV and HCV IRES, both of which initiate translation via an IRES-40S binary complex intermediate; nsp1 inhibited binary complex formation on CrPV IRES and 48S complex formation on HCV IRES. Collectively, the data revealed that nsp1 inhibited translation by exerting its effect on multiple stages of translation initiation, depending on the mechanism of initiation operating on the mRNA template.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.01958-12",""

However, DKA can trigger a systemic inflammatory response with the potential for multiple complications. This 30-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes mellitus improved within 48 hours of admission with a standard DKA treatment protocol. However, subsequent chest X-rays revealed bilateral infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema; she then developed fever, hypotension, and acute-on-chronic renal failure. An altered level of consciousness prompted evaluation with neuroimaging, which revealed ischemic infarcts in the right frontal, parieto-occipital, and temporal cortices and cerebellum correlating with a left-sided hemiparesis. This case illustrates the potential complexity in the pathogenesis and management of patients with DKA. This patient likely had a systemic inflammatory response syndrome with multiorgan failure during this episode of DKA. Patients with DKA need risk stratification for comorbid diseases on presentation and attention to vital signs, especially unexplained fever, evolving neurologic symptoms, and respiratory symptoms during the hospital course. This information can help dictate the time course for treatment; standard treatment protocols for patients with DKA may create a false sense of security in complex patients.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1944451612438714",""
