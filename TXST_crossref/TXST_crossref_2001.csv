For the past decade, much has centered on the tensions between school, college, and department of education (SCDE) programs and alternative programs, and the relative merits and drawbacks of two delivery systems—one in which candidates complete initial certification prior to employment and one that provides training to candidates while they are employed as full-time teachers. The authors advocate a third alternative for midcareer teacher candidates, one that encompasses the strengths and minimizes the weaknesses of the two predominant delivery systems currently available. This alternative is the comprehensive, accelerated, customer-oriented teacher preparation program, coupled with an intensive induction support system. The authors describe one such program and discuss the compelling reasons for SCDEs nationwide to consider moving in this direction.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0022487101052004006",""

In addition to shifts of population served, the program has evolved due to private college competition, employers' demands, and changes in the program focus. The program's success has rested on seven principles: 1) understand the organization's structure; 2) think “outside the box” as challenges occur; 3) select and motivate staff and faculty in change models; 4) examine underserved populations; 5) report program successes often; 6) provide alternative student support services, which complement distance learning; and 7) assure quality indicators as courses are designed.

Dating couples were videotaped while the female partner was waiting to engage in an anxiety-provoking task. Raters then evaluated the behavior of each partner on theoretically relevant dimensions. We found that more avoidantly attached individuals behaved more negatively toward their partners. Moreover, people behaved more negatively if their partners were more avoidant. Very few direct effects of dependence emerged. However, attachment orientations, particularly avoidant attachment and level of dependence, interacted to predict the behavior of both partners. In particular, less avoidant and highly dependent people behaved less negatively toward their partners, whereas more avoidant and less dependent people behaved more negatively. These results are discussed in terms of attachment theory, interdependence theory, and the APIM.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0265407501186005",""

Specifically, we determine the v+=(0,1,0)/v+=(0,0,0) intensity ratio by detecting dispersed fluorescence from the electronically excited photoions. The results exhibit large deviations over a very wide energy range, 18&lt;hνexc&lt;190 eV. Production of the v+=(0,1,0) level of the ion from the v0=(0,0,0) ground state is forbidden by symmetry, and while observations of such features are well established in photoelectron spectroscopy, their appearance is normally ascribed to vibronic coupling in the ionic hole state. In this case, we find that such explanations fail to account for the energy dependence of the branching ratio. These deviations indicate that the continuum photoelectron participates in transferring oscillator strength to the nominally forbidden vibrational transition. A theoretical framework is developed for interpreting the experimental data, and Schwinger variational calculations are performed. These calculations demonstrate that the continuum electron is responsible for the observation of the excited bending mode as well as its energy dependence. This is an intrachannel effect that is best described as photoelectron-induced vibronic symmetry breaking. This appears to be a general phenomenon, and it may be useful in illuminating connections between bond angle and photoionization spectroscopies. The magnitude of these deviations display the utility of vibrationally resolved studies, and the extent over which these changes occur underscores the necessity of broad range studies to elucidate slowly varying characteristics in photoionization continua.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/114/10/4496/19015122/4496_1_online.pdf",""

To this end, we posited that the deficiency could be attributed to the notion that Black coaches leave the profession sooner than do White coaches. In taking an institutional theory perspective, the purpose of this study was to examine possible differences between Black and White assistant coaches for affective occupational commitment and intent to leave the coaching profession. Results of multiple hierarchical regression analyses indicate that normative isomorphic pressures are significant predictors of professional socialization, which in turn predicts commitment to the profession. Finally, there is an inverse relationship between affective occupational commitment and intent to leave the profession. Findings from the study supported the theory to explain the paucity of Black coaches in the NCAA by demonstrating that the deficit could be attributed to the fact that more Black coaches intend to leave the profession than do White coaches. This is true regardless of the fact that Black coaches perceived greater professional socialization than Whites and similar feelings of affective commitment. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/101269001036002001",""

The parameters Ω2, Ω4, and Ω6 are larger than those reported for Nd3+ in other laser host crystals. The value of Ω4/Ω6 is approximately 3.0 times larger than that of Nd3+ in yttrium–aluminum–garnet (YAG) and about 1.4 times larger than that of Nd3+ in the β phase of LaSc3(BO3) reported recently. The measured room temperature fluorescence lifetime of the F3/24→I11/24 transition is 150 μs, while the Judd–Ofelt analysis predicts a radiative lifetime for the F3/24 state to be 249 μs, resulting in the fluorescence quantum efficiency of 60%.

Seed of cvs. Hawk, TAM 200, TAM 107, Scout 66, and Siouxland 89 were separated into three size categories of small, mixed, and large and were planted in the first weeks of September and October 1994 and 1995. Disease ratings for incidence and severity of subcrown internode infections were made in March and at harvest. At harvest, grain yields were collected. In both years of the study, there was no interaction between seed size and cultivars for any of the measured variables. Overall, seed size had no effect on disease severity or grain yield for either year. However, when sorted by planting date, plants from small seed yielded less than plants from other seed. October plantings showed lower disease indices than September plantings at the March evaluation. At the harvest disease evaluation, there were no differences in disease severity between planting dates for the first year but, in the second year of the study, plants from the October planting had lower disease than those from the September planting. There was no significant correlation among seed size, final yield, and disease index. The results of this study suggest that the expense of planting higher-quality certified seed cannot be justified for producing hard red winter wheat in dryland conditions in the Texas Panhandle, considering the current price of wheat and the average dryland yield.","https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/pdf/10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.9.973",""

A parametric study as a function of k reveals interesting physics, ranging from oscillatory “plug-like” flow in the quasi-steady state to flows analogous to the oscillating flat plate in unbounded flow domain (Stokes’ second problem). The latter case differs from Stokes’ second solution within the EDL, since the flow is driven with oscillatory electric field, rather than a moving surface. Utilization of the instantaneous Helmholtz Smoluchowski velocity as the slip boundary condition on the wall matches the bulk flow solution accurately, even for high, frequency excitations.

Although there is much empirical evidence about factors underlying EDI adoption and implementation, there is little information from the perspective of the end user. The vast majority of what we know about EDI success (or failure) is based on the EDI manager’s or IT perspective. However, there is evidence that suggests if users are not satisfied with a system, they will not use it. Thus, a study of user satisfaction with EDI can provide firms seeking to better leverage their EDI investment with a different and useful perspective on factors that underlie EDI. Two findings indicate that the greater the perceived benefits of EDI, the greater the user satisfaction; and the more compatible EDI is with existing organizational practices and systems, the more satisfied the users are with the system. Although EDI managers may have suspected this was true, empirical support of heretofore largely anecdotal evidence has several implications for successfully managing EDI adoption and integration. These implications hold not only for the adopting firm, but also for firms that may require, or are considering requiring, trading partners to implement EDI. Finally, implications for future EDI research are discussed.</p>","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=1197",""

While prior research in the auditing literature has recognized the applicability of a Bayesian belief revision framework for many audit tasks, empirical evidence has suggested that auditors' cognitive decision processes often violate probability axioms. We believe that some of the well-documented cognitive limitations of a human auditor can be compensated by an automated system. In particular, we demonstrate that a formal belief revision scheme can be incorporated into an automated system to provide reliable probability estimates for early warning of bank failures. The automated system examines financial ratios as predictors of a bank's performance and assesses the posterior probability of a banks financial health (alternatively, financial distress). We examine two different probabilistic models, one that is simpler and makes more assumptions, while the other that is somewhat more complex but makes fewer assumptions. We find that both models are able to make accurate predictions with the help of historical data to estimate the required probabilities. In particular, the more complex model is found to be very well calibrated in its probability estimates. We posit that such a model can serve as a useful decision aid to an auditor's judgment process.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mnsc.47.11.1457.10253",""

Results from this study indicate that production of antinuclear antibodies, anticell extract antibodies and natural autoantibodies gradually and significantly increases from young age to old age without a corresponding increase in neither serum immunoglobulin concentration nor in levels of selected markers of immune dysregulation (sTNF-RI, sTNF-RII, IL-2 sRα and IFN-γ). Therefore, in the baboon model, autoantibodies may be produced in absence of recognizable pathological conditions of the ageing immune system.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1046%2Fj.1365-2249.2001.01454.x",""

Based on classical intra- and intermolecular potentials and periodic boundary conditions, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation led to two domain structures at 100 K: those with CONO planes oriented nearly parallel and nearly perpendicular to the Ag(111) surface. To simulate photodissociation dynamics of NO, many NO trajectories were determined, each carried out as follows. At some instant of the MD simulation, a CH3ONO molecule was randomly selected from within the group of 61 and its internal CH3O–NO bond was stretched to a defined dissociation transition state. The nascent NO was given momentum along the direction of the bond broken and NO translational and internal energies were chosen to match those determined experimentally in collision-free gas phase photodissociation. The motion of the whole adsorbate–substrate system was then calculated while following the trajectory of NO. Analyzing the ensemble of NO trajectories, we conclude that, while the initial orientation of the dissociating CH3ONO influences the number of subsequent collisions, the exit direction, and the final translational and internal energy of NO, it does not fully account for the properties of ejected NO. Furthermore, for those molecules lying nearly parallel to the surface, a transition state prepared by simply stretching the O–N bond is often located away from the lowest potential energy exit path due to interactions with nearest neighbor species. As a result, coordinates, e.g., internal twisting, other than the internal CH3O–NO stretching mode are intimately involved in the dissociation channel.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/115/16/7657/19312645/7657_1_online.pdf",""

Both of these aspects can be important for photo-induced electron transfer reactions, particularly for those which are in the Marcus inverted regime. In this article, a theoretical formulation is presented which describes the two aspects. The formalism requires an extension of the hybrid model introduced earlier by Barbara et al. [Science 256, 975 (1992)]. We model a general electron transfer as a two-surface reaction where overlap between the vibrational levels of the two surfaces create multiple, broad reaction windows. The strength and the accessibility of each window is determined by many factors. We find that when VER and reverse transfer are present, the time dependence of the survival probability of the reactant differs significantly (from the case when they are assumed to be absent) for a large range of values of the solvent reorganization energy (λX), quantum mode reorganization energy (λq), electronic coupling constant (Vel) and vibrational energy relaxation rate (kVER). Several interesting results, such as a transient rise in the population of the zeroth vibrational level of the reactant surface, a Kramers (or Grote–Hynes) type recrossing due to back reaction and a pronounced role of the initial Gaussian component of the solvation time correlation function in the dynamics of electron transfer reaction, are observed. Significant dependence of the electron transfer rate on the ultrafast Gaussian component of solvation dynamics is predicted for a range of values of Vel, although dependence on average solvation time can be weak. Another result is that, although VER alters relaxation dynamics in both the product and the reactant surfaces noticeably, the average rate of electron transfer is found to be weakly dependent on kVER for a range of values of Vel; this independence breaks down only at very small values of Vel. In addition, the hybrid model is employed to study the time resolved fluorescence line shape for the electron transfer reactions. It is found that VER can have a significant influence on the fluorescence spectrum. The possibility of vibrational state resolved spectra is investigated.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/115/13/6058/19256507/6058_1_online.pdf",""

CASE SUMMARY:: A 16-year-old Hispanic girl was admitted to the state psychiatric hospital with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder with psychotic features. Clozapine therapy was initiated, and after three months of treatment the patient began experiencing episodes of nocturnal enuresis. The bladder-selective agent tolterodine was tried and subsequently failed to resolve the enuresis episodes. Desmopressin was initiated, which resulted in amelioration of symptoms. DISCUSSION:: This is the first published report of using tolterodine to treat clozapine-induced nocturnal enuresis. Several methods to decrease clozapine-induced urinary incontinence have been used and typically include the addition of agents with high anticholinergic properties. Tolterodine is a bladder-selective anticholinergic agent indicated for the treatment of urinary urge incontinence and may be employed as a treatment for antipsychotic-induced incontinence. CONCLUSIONS:: Nocturnal enuresis is an adverse effect that infrequently occurs with use of clozapine therapy. Although tolterodine was ineffective in our patient to treat clozapine-induced nocturnal enuresis, further trials are required to appropriately evaluate the effectiveness of tolterodine to treat this adverse drug reaction.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1345/aph.10304",""

An initial gravity study of the system demonstrated that a gravity high coincides with the heat‐flow high. A subsequent seismic reflection survey images a strong reflector, interpreted to be associated with a bedrock high that underlies the gravity and heat‐flow highs. A single reflection, which coincides with the water table, occurs within the Tertiary basin fill above bedrock. This reflector is subhorizontal except above structurally high bedrock, where it dips downward. This observation is consistent with well data that indicate a bedrock water table 30 m lower than water in the basin‐fill aquifer. Velocity models derived from seismic tomography show that the basin fill has velocities in the range of 800 to 4000 m/s and that the bedrock reflector coincides with high velocities of 5000 to 6000 m/s. Low‐velocity zones within the bedrock high are interpreted as karsted bedrock with solution‐collapse breccias and cavities filled with hot water. Higher velocity material that flanks the bedrock high may represent an earlier stage of basin fill or older alluvial‐fan deposits. The heat‐flow anomaly appears to be constrained to the region of shallowest bedrock that lacks these deposits, suggesting that they may act as an aquitard to cap underlying bedrock aquifers or geothermal reservoirs. Taken together, these observations suggest that the geothermal system is associated with karsted and fractured structurally high bedrock that serves as a window for upwelling and outflow of thermal waters. Thermal waters with a temperature as high as 89°C have the potential for space heating, geothermal desalinization, and small‐scale electrical production at McGregor Range.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/1.1487048",""

Sixteen parameters were measured at sites along the reservoirs representing each zone (riverine, transition, or lacustrine), and eight of these parameters displayed a statistically significant site/zone effect. Most of these were particle-associated parameters (total Fe, NH4+, total suspended solids, and total phosphorus) that decreased significantly down-reservoir. Water transparency increased significantly down-reservoir, in accordance with this pattern. Temperature and dissolved oxygen also showed a significant spatial effect, as temperature was highest towards the riverine end and dissolved oxygen was highest at the lacustrine end. Six parameters showed significant variability among these reservoirs, including ammonium and chlorophyll a. The remaining four (conductivity, sulfate, alkalinity and pH) displayed similar patterns across reservoirs apparently as a result of local geologic attributes. Another goal of this work was to use a multivariate statistical approach to aid in understanding the relationships between water quality parameters in this region and to group zones within a reservoir according to their similarities in water quality. Principal Components Analysis reduced sixteen parameters to five principal components that accounted for 74 percent of the total variability in water quality. Two of these principal components contained all of the particle-associated and local-geologic parameters, and accounted for 42% of the total variability. Cluster analyses showed that the water quality signatures of two reservoirs were quite different from the rest. Interestingly, these represented the most pristine and most disturbed watersheds of all seven systems. Our findings are relevant to the management of these and other similar reservoir systems.","https://scholarlypublishingcollective.org/msup/aehm/article-pdf/4/4/463/1444855/463davis.pdf",""

When the planning problem is difficult and the shortest plan is of a reasonable length, this linear search can take a long time; to speed up the process, it has been proposed to use binary search instead. Binary search for the value of a certain parameter x is optimal when for each tested value x, we need the same amount of computation time; in planning, the computation time increases with the size of the plan and, as a result, binary search is no longer optimal. We describe an optimal way of combining planning algorithms into a search for the shortest plan – optimal in the sense of worst-case complexity.

However, not all students have responded favorably to this instruction. Research has suggested that these nonresponders may be unable to retrieve phonological codes quickly from long-term memory. The purpose of this study was to examine whether such a deficiency, which we refer to as lexical retrieval weakness, blunts the effectiveness of combined phonemic awareness and decoding training. To this end, we compared the effectiveness of phonemic awareness and decoding training for students with and without severe lexical retrieval weaknesses. All students in both groups demonstrated poor phonemic awareness. The results suggested that students with relatively strong lexical retrieval skill responded more favorably to beginning reading instruction than did students with weak lexical retrieval skill. In other words, lexical retrieval weakness may influence reading development independently of the effects of phonemic awareness.

The probability that a pregnant woman chooses an abortion appears to be sensitive to availability‐induced variations in the travel cost of abortion services. Controlling for the endogeneity of travel distance, the results suggest that pregnant women who reside in counties with longer travel distances to the nearest abortion provider have lower probabilities of aborting their pregnancies than women in counties closer to abortion providers. Simulations show that changes in travel distance will have relatively large impacts on overall abortion rates and, furthermore, that these effects vary across race. In addition, these simulations show substantial differences by race in the effects of changes in other explanatory variables.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/j.2325-8012.2001.tb00361.x",""

Both lower body negative pressure (LBNP; −15 and −30 mmHg) and rapid saline infusion (15 and 30 ml/kg body wt) were used to produce a wide variation in PCWP. Orthostatic tolerance was assessed with graded LBNP to presyncope. Bed rest reduced LBNP tolerance from 23.9 ± 2.1 to 21.2 ± 1.5 min, respectively (means ± SE, P= 0.02). The MSNA-PCWP relationship was unchanged after bed rest, though at any stage of the LBNP protocol PCWP was lower, and MSNA was greater. Thus bed rest deconditioning produced hypovolemia, causing a shift in operating point on the stimulus-response curve. The relationship between limb vascular resistance and MSNA was not significantly altered after bed rest. We conclude that bed rest deconditioning does not alter reflex control of MSNA, but may produce orthostatic intolerance through a combination of hypovolemia and cardiac atrophy.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpheart.2001.280.5.H2230",""

The code is based on a stream function model and a finite element solution procedure. A new design system has been developed which optimizes hub and shroud geometry and inlet and exit flow field parameters for each blade row of a multistage axial flow turbine. Optimization was performed using a hybrid constrained optimization code that switches among the modules automatically in order to avoid local minima and to accelerate design convergence rate. By automatically varying a relatively small number of geometric variables per turbine stage it is possible to find an optimal radial distribution of flow parameters at the inlet and outlet of every blade row. Thus, an optimized meridional flow path can be found that is defined by the optimized shape of the hub and shroud while keeping blade shapes intact. The multistage design optimization system has been demonstrated using an actual two-stage axial gas turbine as an example. The comparison of computed performance of an already very high efficiency initial design and its optimized design demonstrates more than 1 per cent improvement in the turbine efficiency at design and significant off-design conditions. The entire design optimization process is feasible on a typical single-processor computer workstation or a personal computer.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1243/0957650011538802",""

Consistent with earlier experiments, the external focus group produced generally smaller balance errors than did the internal focus group and responded at a higher frequency indicating higher confluence between voluntary and reflexive mechanisms. In addition, probe reaction times (RTs) were taken as a measure of the attention demands required under the two attentional focus conditions. Consistent with the hypothesis, the external focus participants demonstrated lower probe RTs than did the internal focus participants, indicating a higher degree of automaticity and less conscious interference in the control processes associated with the balance task.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/713756012",""

To enhance the utility of salamanders for biomedical research and for understanding genome evolution, genetic linkage analysis was used to identify chromosome segments that are homologous between ambystomatid salamanders and distantly related vertebrate model organisms. A total of 347 loci (AFLPs, RAPDs, and protein-coding loci) were mapped using an interspecific meiotic mapping panel (Ambystoma mexicanum and A. tigrinum tigrinum; family Ambystomatidae). Genome size in Ambystoma was estimated to be 7291 cM, the largest linkage map estimate reported for any organism. However, the relatively large size of the salamander genome did not hinder efforts to map and identify conserved syntenies from a small sample of 24 protein-coding loci. Chromosomal segments that are conserved between fishes and mammals are also conserved in these salamanders. Thus, comparative gene mapping appears to be an efficient strategy for identifying orthologous loci between ambystomatid salamanders and genomically well-characterized vertebrate model organisms.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/158/2/735/42035897/genetics0735.pdf",""

We show that four-jointed is not only required for these processes, but also can direct ectopic growth and joint initiation when its normal pattern of expression is disturbed. These effects are non-autonomous, consistent with our demonstration of both transmembrane and secreted forms of the protein in vivo. The similarities between four-jointed and Notch phenotypes led us to further investigate the relationships between these pathways. Surprisingly, we find that although four-jointed expression is regulated downstream of Notch activation, four-jointed can induce expression of the Notch ligands, Serrate and Delta, and may thereby participate in a feedback loop with the Notch signaling pathway. We also show that four-jointed interacts with abelson, enabled and dachs, which leads us to suggest that one target of four-jointed signaling is the actin cytoskeleton. Thus, four-jointed may bridge the gap between the signals that direct morphogenesis and those that carry it out.","http://journals.biologists.com/dev/article-pdf/128/18/3533/1136643/3533.pdf",""

The expression of the GR gene is regulated by at least three different promoters and the resulting mRNAs can be differentially spliced into several transcriptional variants (1-3). Following the translation of these transcripts into protein, the activity and/or subcellular distribution of the GR protein may be modified by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (4). In the absence of ligand, the GR is found primarily in the cytoplasm associated with protein chaperones, such as heat shock protein 90 (HSP 90), which act to maintain the receptor in an inactive state (5). Other proteins, called co-activators and co-repressors, bind to and modulate the transcriptional activity of nuclear receptors (6). The GR is activated by binding glucocorticoid (GC): it is then translocated into the nucleus where it can alter gene transcription through two avenues. The classical mode of action is for activated GR to alter transcription directly by binding a glucocorticoid responsive element (GRE), a negative glucocorticoid responsive element (NGRE), or a composite GRE. The GR can also alter transcription directly without binding DNA by interacting with other transcription factors that bind DNA. The second avenue of GR action is via transcriptional interference, whereby the activity of a transcription factor is diminished by an interaction with the GR (7).","https://academic.oup.com/book/chapter-pdf/52367789/isbn-9780199638819-book-part-11.pdf",""

Animals in the Fl group were exposed to 7 days of microgravity during the Spacelab 3 mission.

TBLV is highly related to mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) except that TBLV long terminal repeats (LTRs) have a deletion of negative regulatory elements and a triplication of sequences flanking the deletion. To determine if the LTR triplication represents a viral enhancer element, we inserted the triplication upstream and downstream in either orientation relative to the thymidine kinase promoter linked to the luciferase gene. These experiments showed that upregulation of reporter gene activity by the TBLV triplication was relatively orientation independent, consistent with the activity of eukaryotic enhancer elements. TBLV enhancer activity was observed in T-cell lines but not in fibroblasts, B cells, or mammary cells, suggesting that enhancer function is cell type dependent. To analyze the transcription factor binding sites that are important for TBLV enhancer function, we prepared substitution mutations in a reconstituted C3H MMTV LTR that recapitulates the deletion observed in the TBLV LTR. Transient transfections showed that a single mutation (556M) decreased TBLV enhancer activity at least 20-fold in two different T-cell lines. This mutation greatly diminished AML-1 (recently renamed RUNX1) binding in gel shift assays with a mutant oligonucleotide, whereas AML-1 binding to a wild-type TBLV oligomer was specific, as judged by competition and supershift experiments. The 556 mutation also reduced TBLV enhancer binding of two other protein complexes, called NF-A and NF-B, that did not appear to be related to c-Myb or Ets.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.75.5.2174-2184.2001",""

However, this observation is insufficient to conclude that NO concentration increases in the skin during a heat stress. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that whole body heating increases cutaneous interstitial NO concentration. This was accomplished by placing 2 microdialysis membranes in the forearm dermal space of 12 subjects. Both membranes were perfused with lactated Ringer solutions at a rate of 2 μl/min. In both normothermia and during whole body heating via a water perfused suit, dialysate from these membranes were obtained and analyzed for NO using the chemiluminescence technique. In six of these subjects, after the heat stress, the membranes were perfused with a 1 M solution of acetylcholine to stimulate NO release. Dialysate from these trials was also assayed to quantify cutaneous interstitial NO concentration. Whole body heating increased skin temperature from 34.6 ± 0.2 to 38.8 ± 0.2°C ( P < 0.05), which increased sublingual temperature (36.4 ± 0.1 to 37.6 ± 0.1°C; P < 0.05), heart rate (63 ± 5 to 93 ± 5 beats/min; P < 0.05), and skin blood flow over the membranes (21 ± 4 to 88 ± 10 perfusion units; P < 0.05). NO concentration in the dialysate did not increase significantly during of the heat stress (7.6 ± 0.7 to 8.6 ± 0.8 μM; P > 0.05). After the heat stress, administration of acetylcholine in the perfusate significantly increased skin blood flow (128 ± 6 perfusion units) relative to both normothermic and heat stress values and significantly increased NO concentration in the dialysate (15.8 ± 2.4 μM). These data suggest that whole body heating does not increase cutaneous interstitial NO concentration in forearm skin. Rather, NO may serve in a permissive role in facilitating the effects of an unknown neurotransmitter, leading to cutaneous vasodilation during a heat stress.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jappl.2001.90.3.1020",""

However, we have found the traditional cryogenic apparatus inconvenient in the following aspects: (1) The system does not work very well in preventing moisture/frost from condensing on the salt windows or samples. (2) The indirect way of cooling using a metal cold finger limits the efficiency of the system. We have designed a new cryogenic apparatus. The apparatus is composed of a cooling stage and a measuring stage. In the cooling stage, the sample is directly immersed in liquid nitrogen. In the measuring stage, the sample is lifted just above the surface of liquid nitrogen, and the FT-IR spectrum is recorded. The dry cold nitrogen gas evaporated from liquid nitrogen forms a protective layer surrounding the sample and prevents moisture from condensing on the sample. Thus, neither vacuum nor salt windows are needed in cryogenic spectroscopic experiments using this method. The experimental results show that our method is effective in cryogenic FT-IR spectroscopic studies.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1366/0003702011952271",""

Pers. × C. transvaalensis Burtt-Davy) is widely used on golf course putting greens in the southern United States. In March and April 1998, circular patches of dead grass 2 to 10 cm in diameter were observed on a bermudagrass putting green in College Station, TX, that had been overseeded with rough bluegrass (Poa trivialis L.) the previous October. Rapid death and deterioration of the rough bluegrass within the spot revealed extensive foliar and crown necrosis and root decay of the remaining bermudagrass. Diseased bermudagrass leaves in the patch were reddish brown to tan. Dark ectotrophic hyphae were not found on the roots or stolons, but dark hyphae were observed within the affected root tissues. Numerous pseudothecia were embedded in necrotic leaf and stolon tissues. The characteristics of the pseudothecia and ascospores coincide with the description of Ophiosphaerella agrostis Dernoeden, Camara, O'Neil, van Berkum, and Palm (1,2). This fungus was consistently isolated from stolons and roots, and single-ascospore isolates were obtained from pseudothecia. Inoculum was prepared by transferring fungal mycelium from a single-spore isolate grown in potato dextrose agar (PDA) to a moistened, autoclaved mixture of rice hulls (Oryza sativa L.) and milled rice (2:1, vol/vol) for 28 days at 24°C. ‘FloraDwarf’ bermudagrass was grown from stolons in 15-cm-diameter pots containing a mixture of sand, peat moss, and perlite (8:3:1, vol/vol). The bermudagrass was maintained at a height of 1 to 1.5 cm for ≈ 1 month. Plants were inoculated by forming a hole that was 0.8 cm in diameter and 7 cm deep in the center of the pot, using a rod and filling the hole with inoculum. Control pots received the same treatment, except uninoculated rice hull-milled rice mixture was used. The treatments were replicated three times, and the experiment was performed twice. The pots were maintained in a greenhouse for 6 weeks. In all inoculated pots, patches of dead bermudagrass 6 to 10 cm in diameter developed. Roots, stolons, and leaves were necrotic, and pseudothecia were abundant in stolon and leaf sheath tissues. O. agrostis was consistently reisolated from infected root and stolon tissues. All isolates produced colonies identical in appearance to the culture used for inoculation. To our knowledge, this is the first report that O. agrostis is pathogenic to hybrid bermudagrass.","https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/abs/10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.12.1286B",""

The procedure combines multiple attribute utility theory with statistical ranking and selection to select the best configuration from a set of possible configurations using the indifference-zone approach.

Imaging of the temperature field in tissue is important for guiding HIFU treatment. Temperature rise in excised and degassed bovine liver exposed to high-intensity focused ultrasound was visualized experimentally and simulated numerically. An infrared camera, which records surface temperature only, was used to measure spatial temperature distribution. Two blocks of tissue were stacked, and their interface was placed along the axis of the ultrasound beam. A single element concave transducer (2 MHz, 35-mm aperture, 51-mm radius of curvature) was used. After exposure to ultrasound, the upper piece was immediately removed, and the temperature on the axial plane was infrared imaged. The absorption coefficient of liver was measured and then used for numerical simulations. The theoretical model employs a KZK-type equation for the acoustic pressure field combined with a bioheat equation. It is shown that experiment and theory agree well on the location, shape, and dimensions of the heated region.

After annealing at 600 °C, the oxide layers were amorphous. After an 800 °C treatment, crystallites appeared in the original La2O3 layer, and the total oxide layer thickness increased by 17%, most likely due to the oxygen diffusion and reaction at the Si/SiO2 interface. EELS, using a 0.2 nm probe, showed that rapid thermal annealing at 600 °C did not cause significant La diffusion into the SiO2 layer, whereas some intermixing was observed at 800 °C.

A family of nuclear receptors that are activated by fatty acids and their metabolites, the peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), have been implicated in apoptosis and may represent a target for MK886. The ability of MK886 to inhibit PPAR-α, −β and −γ activity was assessed using reporter assay systems (peroxisome-proliferator response element–luciferase). Using a transient transfection system in monkey kidney fibroblast CV-1 cells, mouse keratinocyte 308 cells and human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, 10–20μM MK886 inhibited Wy14,643 activation of PPARα by approximately 80%. Similar inhibition of PPARα by MK886 was observed with a stable transfection reporter system in CV-1 cells. Only minimal inhibitory effects were seen on PPARβ and PPARγ. MK886 inhibited PPARα by a non-competitive mechanism as shown by its effects on the binding of arachidonic acid to PPARα protein, and a dose–response study using a transient transfection reporter assay in COS-1 cells. An assay assessing PPAR ligand–receptor interactions showed that MK886 prevents the conformational change necessary for active-complex formation. The expression of keratin-1, a protein encoded by a PPARα-responsive gene, was reduced by MK886 in a culture of mouse primary keratinocytes, suggesting that PPAR inhibition has functional consequences in normal cells. Although Jurkat cells express all PPAR isoforms, various PPARα and PPARγ agonists were unable to prevent MK886-induced apoptosis. This is consistent with MK886 functioning as a non-competitive inhibitor of PPARα, but may also indicate that PPARα is not directly involved in MK886-induced apoptosis. Although numerous PPAR activators have been identified, the results show that MK886 can inhibit PPARα, making it the first compound identified to have such an effect.","https://portlandpress.com/biochemj/article-pdf/356/3/899/707112/bj3560899.pdf",""

The Knops blood group (KN) is located on CR1 and some of these antigens, ie, McCoy (McC) and Swain-Langley (Sla), show marked frequency differences between Caucasians and Africans. Thus, defining the molecular basis of these antigens may provide new insight into the mechanisms of P falciparummalaria. Monoclonal antibody epitope mapping and serologic inhibition studies using CR1 deletion constructs localized McC and Slato long homologous repeat D of CR1. Direct DNA sequencing of selected donors identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms in exon 29 coding for complement control protein modules 24 and 25. Two of these appeared to be blood group specific: McC associated with K1590E and Sla with R1601G. These associations were confirmed by inhibition studies using allele-specific mutants. A sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe hybridization assay was developed to genotype several African populations and perform family inheritance studies. Concordance between the 1590 mutation and McC was 94%; that between Sla and 1601 was 88%. All but 2 samples exhibiting discrepancies between the genotype and phenotype were found to be due to low red cell CR1 copy numbers, low or absent expression of some alleles, or heterozygosity combined with low normal levels of CR1. These data further explain the variability observed in previous serologic studies of CR1 and show that DNA and protein-based genetic studies will be needed to clarify the role of the KN antigens in malaria.","http://ashpublications.org/blood/article-pdf/97/9/2879/1673172/h8090102879.pdf",""

Identification of the site is based on laser excited site-selective spectroscopic studies reported earlier. Experimental Stark levels are compared with calculated levels based on lattice-sum models that include charge compensation in the lattice structure. The final set of atomic parameters for U4+ is in good agreement with values reported for the ion in UF4. The predicted non-Kramers’ doublet as the ground-state Stark level for U4+ in C3V sites is in agreement with the spectroscopic analysis and with results reported earlier from electron spin-resonance studies of CaF2:U4+. Using pump–probe methods, we have investigated excited state absorption (ESA) at 1.54 μm.

The densification and the elastic modulus of the photopolymer layer can be tailored from 4% to 16%, and from 2 to 30 MPa, respectively, by changing the structure of the photopolymer precursors and their formulation. The complex interaction among densification, mechanical properties (elastic modulus and Poisson’s ratio) and aspect ratio (height:width) was studied by finite element modeling. The effect of these parameters on linewidth, sidewall angle, and image placement was modeled. The results indicate that the majority of densification occurs by shrinkage in the direction normal to the substrate surface and that Poisson’s ratio plays a critical role in defining the shape of the replicated features. Over the range of material properties that were determined experimentally, volumetric contraction of the photopolymer is not predicted to adversely affect either pattern placement or sidewall angle.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-pdf/19/6/2685/10995417/2685_1_online.pdf",""

A series of experiments has been carried out with the goal of quantifying the effect of defect propagation. To that end, each unit process in SFIL was studied independently. The number of particles added during handling and transportation and due to SFIL machinery was deemed acceptable, and the added particles should not complicate the inspection of process defects. The concept of a “self-cleaning” process in which the imprint template becomes cleaner by imprinting was revisited. Inspection of an imprint template before and after imprinting revealed that the template actually becomes cleaner with imprinting. Visual inspection of multiple imprints did not reveal any systematic generation or propagation of defects. The inspection area used in this study was limited, however, since the inspection was both manual and visual.

PHN is pain persisting after the rash of herpes zoster has healed. PHN affects at least 40% of all herpes zoster patients over age 50 and over 75% of herpes zoster patients over age 75; PHN is the single most common neurologic condition in elderly patients. Objective:: The objective of this review is to evaluate interventions that may reduce or even eliminate PHN. No single therapy has been consistently effective for PHN. The most effective approach appears to be with the use of antiviral therapy early in the course of herpes zoster. The goals of ongoing studies in herpes zoster are to develop interventions that will further reduce the symptoms of PHN and/or to eliminate PHN by prophylaxis using the varicella vaccine. Conclusions:: Reduction of PHN can best be achieved with the use of antiviral medication early in the course of herpes zoster; other classes of drugs are minimally effective in treating established PHN. Widespread use of the varicella vaccine may lead to secondary reductions in PHN in the distant future.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/120347540100500508",""

Recent studies have also indicated that smoking may be more closely related to high-grade lesions of the cervix and vulva. These data provide evidence of an association between HPV, smoking, and cancer. Progression of dysplasia likewise seems to be associated with smoking. Several groups have attempted to discern whether the connection between smoking and cervical cancer is from local immunosuppression and/or from direct carcinogenic effects.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/120347540100500408",""

These viruses produce benign warts in many cases and aggressive squamous cell carcinomas in other cases. Objective:: The goal of this review is to update the reader on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and therapy of HPV infections. Nonanogenital warts are transmitted by skin-to-skin contact while anogenital warts are usually transmitted sexually. Both types of warts produce much morbidity but rarely undergo malignant transformation. They are commonly treated with surgical or cytodestructive therapy, but immunomodulatory agents, such as imiquimod, have been proven to be very effective in anogenital warts and are being evaluated in nonanogenital warts. Other types of HPV have marked oncogenic potential such that over 99% of all cervical cancers and over 50% of other anogenital cancers are due to infection with oncogenic HPV. Many cofactors, such as cigarette smoking, genetics, and helper viruses, have potential roles in HPV oncogenesis, but their relative contributions are poorly understood. Other control measures for warts and HPV-associated cancers are under study, but the greatest future potential may be from the development of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines. Conclusions:: Infection with HPV is very prevalent as are the clinical manifestations of this family of pathogens. Improved therapies for warts (e.g., imiquimod) have recently become available. Vaccines for HPV offer hope for future interventions for warts as well as for prevention of anogenital malignancies.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/120347540100500110",""

The anthracyclines (doxorubicin, epirubicin) and the taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel) are considered the most active agents for patients with advanced breast cancer. Traditionally, the anthracyclines have been used in combination with cyclophosphamide and 5-fluorouracil (FAC, FEC). The taxanes have single-agent activity similar to older combination chemotherapy treatments. There is great interest in developing anthracycline/taxane combinations. Capecitabine is indicated for patients who progress after anthracycline and taxane therapy. Vinorelbine and gemcitabine have activity in patients with metastatic breast cancer and are commonly used as third- and fourth-line palliative therapy. The role of high-dose chemotherapy is not well-defined and remains experimental. Novel cytotoxic therapy strategies include the development of anthracycline, taxane, and oral fluoropyrimidine analogues; antifolates; topoisomerase I inhibitors, and multidrug resistance inhibitors.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1634/theoncologist.6-2-133",""

Of the 24 predictors of new product performance investigated, product advantage, market potential, meeting customer needs, predevelopment task proficiencies, and dedicated resources, on average, have the most significant impact on new product performance. The authors also find that the predictor–performance relationships can vary by measurement factor (e.g., the use of multi-item scales, subjective versus objective measures of performance, senior versus project management reporting, time elapsed since product introduction) or contextual factor (e.g., services versus goods, Asian versus North American markets, competition in high-technology versus low-technology markets).

We performed genetic screens in low white light—a threshold condition in which photomorphogenetic signaling pathways are only partially active—for ethyl methane sulfonate-generated mutants with altered developmental phenotypes. Recessive mutants with exaggerated developmental responses were obtained in eight complementation groups designated shl for seedlings hyperresponsive to light.shl1, shl2, shl5, and shl3 shl4 (double mutant) seedlings showed limited or no phenotypic effects in darkness, but showed significantly enhanced inhibition of hypocotyl elongation in low-white, red, far-red, blue, and green light across a range of fluences. These results reflect developmental hyper-responsiveness to signals generated by both phytochrome and cryptochrome photoreceptors. The shl11 mutant retained significant phenotypic effects on hypocotyl length in both the phyA mutant andphyB mutant backgrounds but may be dependent onCRY1 for phenotypic expression in blue light. Theshl2 phenotype was partially dependent onPHYB, PHYA, and CRY1 in red, far-red, and blue light, respectively. shl2 and, in particular, shl1 were partially dependent onHY5 activity for their light-hyperresponsive phenotypes. The SHL genes act (genetically) as light-dependent negative regulators of photomorphogenesis, possibly in a downstream signaling or developmental pathway that is shared byCRY1, PHYA, and PHYB and other photoreceptors (CRY2, PHYC,PHYD, and PHYE).","http://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-pdf/127/1/295/38683281/plphys_v127_1_295.pdf",""

Unlike vascular lipoprotein cholesterol transport, intracellular cholesterol trafficking is only beginning to be resolved. Exogenous cholesterol and cholesterol ester enter cells via the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor/lysosomal and less so by nonvesicular, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) receptor/caveolar pathways. However, the mechanism(s) whereby cholesterol enters the lysosomal membrane, translocates, and transfers out of the lysosome to the cell interior are unknown. Likewise, the steps whereby cholesterol enters the cytofacial leaflet of the plasma membrane caveolae, rapidly translocates, leaves the exofacial leaflet, and transfers to extracellular HDL are unclear. Increasing evidence obtained with model and isolated cell membranes, transfected cells, genetic mutants, and gene-ablated mice suggests that proteins such as caveolin, sterol carrier protein-2 (SCP-2), Niemann-Pick C1 protein, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), and other intracellular proteins mediate intracellular cholesterol transfer. While these proteins bind cholesterol and/or interact with cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains (e.g., caveolae, rafts, and annuli), their relative contributions to direct molecular versus vesicular cholesterol transfer remain to be resolved. The formation, regulation, and role of membrane microdomains in regulating cholesterol uptake/efflux and trafficking are unclear. Some cholesterol-binding proteins exert opposing effects on cellular cholesterol uptake/efflux, transfer of cholesterol out of the lysosomal membrane, and/or intracellular cholesterol trafficking to select membranous organelles. Resolving these cholesterol pathways and the role of membrane cholesterol microdomains is essential to our understanding not only of processes that affect cholesterol metabolism, but also of the abnormal regulation that may lead to disease (diabetes, obesity, atherosclerosis, neutral lipid storage, Niemann-Pick C, congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia, etc.).","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/153537020122601002",""

Recent data suggest that CMV-R in patients treated with HAART may remain relapse-free for long periods. We performed a study of the effects of HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) on the incidence of relapse and time to death in AIDS patients with CMV-R treated with anti-CMV therapy. Medical records of all AIDS patients with CMV-R at Parkland Memorial Health and Hospital System treated with anti-CMV agents were reviewed for date of diagnosis of CMV-R, date of CMV-R relapse, type and duration of anti-CMV therapy, and duration of PI therapy. Relapse rates in subjects treated with PIs were compared with the relapse rates in those who were not treated with PIs. The primary endpoint was the time to relapse and death as determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Multivariate analysis was performed by Cox proportional hazard model. One hundred and nine cases of CMV-R were identified in 75 patients. Median follow-up time was 247 days (range 31-1818 days). There were 0.54 relapses per 1000 patient days in the group treated with PIs compared with 1.83 relapses per 1000 patient days in the non-PI treatment group (relative risk [RR]=0.29, P<0.01). Time to relapse was increased in the PI treatment group compared with the non-PI treatment group (endpoint not reached vs 182 days, P<0.001, log-rank). Similarly, the time to relapse or death was increased in the PI group compared with the non-PI group (543 days vs 103 days, P<0.001, log-rank). Multivariate analysis utilizing the Cox proportional hazards model demonstrated that only PI therapy but not anti-CMV therapy was associated with decreased risk of CMV-R relapse or death. Only 3 patients with an undetectable HIV viral load and one patient with a CD4 count >120 cells/ µl had a relapse.

The purpose of the present study was to elucidate the relative effectiveness of several PMN agonists in stimulating lysosomal-enzyme secretion and leukotriene (LT) B4 production by PMNs isolated from diabetic subjects. Formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) and platelet-activating factor (PAF) induced significantly less lysosomal-enzyme secretion and LTB4 production in diabetic-subject PMNs than in normal-subject PMNs. It is surprising that PMNs from these same diabetic subjects responded normally after stimulation with A23187, serum-opsonized zymosan, or phorbol myristate acetate. The in vitro responsiveness of PMNs stimulated with fMLP or PAF was inversely correlated with indices of in vivo glycemic control (fasting plasma glucose and glycated-hemoglobin levels). In combination, these results indicate that hyperglycemia is associated with sustained decreases in PMN function but only in response to agonists that initiate stimulus-response coupling via G-protein-coupled receptors. This agonist-selective reduction in PMN responsiveness may contribute to the compromised host defense associated with sustained hyperglycemia in diabetes.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1189/jlb.70.3.395",""

Apoptosis is an active form of cell death associated with a tightly regulated expression of gene products that are either pro- or antiapoptotic. The aim of this study was to characterize pancreatic mRNA levels by Northern blotting analysis of apoptosis-associated genes used during the course of cerulein-induced AP in mice. Histone H3 mRNA levels were also examined as an indicator of cell proliferation. Acinar cell apoptosis was confirmed histologically. The findings show that AP modifies pancreatic mRNA levels of both pro- and antiapoptotic genes simultaneously. Pancreatic bclXL, bax, and p53 mRNA levels increased significantly in a temporal fashion during induction of AP. Pancreatic bcl-2 mRNA levels were unchanged during AP. Pancreatic mRNA levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), a mitogen and cell survival factor, and its receptor (IGF-1R) also increased in a temporal fashion during induction of AP. In summary, this study indicates that acinar cell death during cerulein-induced AP in mice can occur by the apoptotic pathway. Since factors promoting and antagonistic for cell survival are activated simultaneously, regulation of acinar cell survival appears complex and dynamic during AP.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/153537020222600716",""

A close correlation between the mRNA abundance of nucleolin and mitosis has also been previously reported. These results raised the question of whether the effects of light on nucleolin mRNA expression were a consequence of light effects on mitosis. To test this we compared the kinetics of light-mediated increases in cell proliferation with that of light-mediated changes in the abundance of nucleolin mRNA using plumules of dark-grown pea (Pisum sativum) seedlings. These experiments show that S-phase increases 9 h after a red light pulse, followed by M-phase increases in the plumule leaves at 12 h post-irradiation, a time course consistent with separately measured kinetics of red light-induced increases in the expression of cell cycle-regulated genes. These increases in cell cycle-regulated genes are photoreversible, implying that the light-induced increases in cell proliferation are, like nucleolin mRNA expression, regulated via phytochrome. Red light stimulates increases in the mRNA for nucleolin at 6 h post-irradiation, prior to any cell proliferation changes and concurrent with the reported timing of phytochrome-mediated increases of rRNA abundance. After a green light pulse, nucleolin mRNA levels increase without increasing S-phase or M-phase. Studies in animals and yeast indicate that nucleolin plays a significant role in ribosome biosynthesis. Consistent with this function, pea nucleolin can rescue nucleolin deletion mutants of yeast that are defective in rRNA synthesis. Our data show that during de-etiolation, the increased expression of nucleolin mRNA is more directly regulated by light than by mitosis.","http://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-pdf/125/1/339/38677280/plphys_v125_1_339.pdf",""

To examine the role of surgery in the treatment of dural sinus calvarial metastases, we reviewed retrospectively 13 patients who were treated with surgery at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1993 and 1999. We compared them with 14 patients who had calvarial metastases that did not involve a venous sinus. METHODS: Clinical charts, radiological studies, pathological findings, and operative reports were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The median age of patients with dural sinus calvarial metastases was 54 years. Nine patients were men and four were women. Renal cell carcinoma and sarcoma were the most common primary tumors. Similar features were noted in the 14 patients with nonsinus calvarial metastases. Of the 13 dural sinus calvarial metastases, 11 involved the superior sagittal sinus, and 2 involved the transverse sinus. In nine patients, the involved sinus was resected, and in four patients, the sinus was reconstituted after tumor removal. Nine patients in the dural sinus calvarial metastases group received en bloc resection, and four received piecemeal resection. No operative deaths occurred. The overall median actuarial survival was 16.5 months. The survival times of the two groups were comparable. In the group with dural sinus calvarial metastases, transient postoperative neurological deficits occurred in two patients (15%), and a permanent deficit occurred in one patient (8%). No patients in the group with nonsinus calvarial metastases experienced deficits after resection. Compared with piecemeal resection, en bloc resection was associated with significantly less blood loss. CONCLUSION: Complete extirpation of calvarial metastases that overlie or invade a dural sinus can be achieved with only slightly more morbidity than complete removal of calvarial metastases that are located away from the sinuses. En bloc resection is as safe as piecemeal resection and is more effective in limiting operative blood loss. The overall recurrence and survival rates of patients with dural sinus calvarial metastases are similar to those of patients with calvarial metastases that do not involve the sinuses. Therefore, involvement of a dural venous sinus should not discourage resection of calvarial metastases. In carefully selected cancer patients, surgery provides effective palliation of symptomatic calvarial metastases that overlie or invade the venous sinuses.","http://academic.oup.com/neurosurgery/article-pdf/48/4/745/32549563/00006123-200104000-00009.pdf",""

Six patients presented with arteriovenous malformations. Preoperative diagnosis was by endoscopy (three of six), scintigraphy (two of two), and/or angiography (two of six). Intraoperative panendoscopy was used for localization in 5 cases. Three other patients had tumors (leiomyoma, leiomyosarcoma, and adenocarcinoma) by CT scan (two) and/or scintigraphy (two).

We administered DHEA (0.45% w/w of food) to C57BL/6 (B6) and (B6 x DBA/2)F1 (BDF1) mice for 5 weeks. Food intake was inhibited in both strains of mice during the first week. Thereafter, B6, but not BDF1, mice consumed less food. Because hypothalamic serotonin and/or dopamine regulate appetite, satiety and other behaviors, the hypothesis tested was that hypothalamic concentration of serotonin, dopamine and/or their metabolites are affected differentially in B6 and BDF1 mice fed DHEA. In another study, mice were fed the AIN-76A diet with or without DHEA for 1 and 7 days or were pair-fed to DHEA-fed mice for 7 days. On Day 1 of DHEA feeding (acute effects) hypothalamic levels of serotonin, dopamine, and metabolites were unchanged in B6 mice, but levels of dopamine were increased and levels of dopamine metabolites were decreased in BDF1 mice. On Day 7 of DHEA feeding, levels of serotonin were increased in BDF1 but not B6 mice. On Day 7 of pair-feeding there were decreased levels of hypothalamic dopamine metabolites in BDF1 but not B6 mice.

Orexin neuropeptides (also known as hypocretins) are produced by a small group of neurons in the lateral hypothalamic and perifornical areas, a region classically implicated in the control of mammalian feeding behavior. Orexin neurons project throughout the central nervous system (CNS) to nuclei known to be important in the control of feeding, sleep-wakefulness, neuroendocrine homeostasis, and autonomic regulation. orexin mRNA expression is upregulated by fasting and insulin-induced hypoglycemia. C-fos expression in orexin neurons, an indicator of neuronal activation, is positively correlated with wakefulness and negatively correlated with rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep states. Intracerebroventricular administration of orexins has been shown to significantly increase food consumption, wakefulness, and locomotor activity in rodent models. Conversely, an orexin receptor antagonist inhibits food consumption. Targeted disruption of the orexin gene in mice produces a syndrome remarkably similar to human and canine narcolepsy, a sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and other pathological manifestations of the intrusion of REM sleep-related features into wakefulness. Furthermore, orexin knockout mice are hypophagic compared with weight and age-matched littermates, suggesting a role in modulating energy metabolism. These findings suggest that the orexin neuropeptide system plays a significant role in feeding and sleep-wakefulness regulation, possibly by coordinating the complex behavioral and physiologic responses of these complementary homeostatic functions.","https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.neuro.24.1.429",""

Over the range of incident translational energies (0.1–0.6 eV) and angles (0° to 60°) studied, when J=40, the trapping probability has decreased by about 30% relative to the probability at low J values.

Voltage pulses (bias voltages of 0.1–6 V, either polarity) are applied to a specific location on the oxide surface with the feedback current loop operative to prevent tip/sample physical contact. Subsequent STM constant current imaging reveals the effects of high field on surface composition and topography. The results show that dielectric breakdown occurs at a field of 12.3±1.0 MV/cm. Breakdown is marked by the creation of features with apparent size of 8–25 nm high and 100–250 nm wide in the constant current STM images, and by the loss of the insulating nature of the oxide as deduced from current/voltage spectroscopy. Constant height scanning indicates that these features are caused by electronic changes in the oxide and not by mass transport. At lower electric fields, small voids that are 0.2–0.8 nm deep can be created. STM images taken at a 2 vs 0.1 V gap voltage show that these voids are located at the oxide/metal interface, where they grow into the metal. Repeated application of a lower field within the void region leads to dielectric breakdown, even though the same field does not induce breakdown in regions away from the void. The results provide direct evidence of the ability of localized defects to decrease the barrier to dielectric breakdown in an ordered oxide film.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jva/article-pdf/19/4/1947/10988114/1947_1_online.pdf",""

Several lasers such as pulsed dye, alexandrite and holmium:YAG have been successfully used as intracorporeal lithotriptors[3–5]. Calculus fragmentation is produced by the combination of direct thermal energy absorption and laser induced shock waves[5–7]. During this powerful laser-tissue interaction, the calculus is subject to a strong retropulsive momentum caused by particle ejection or laser induced shock waves[8]. If the stone cannot resist this kinetic momentum, it will recoil away from the laser delivery fiber. Then physicians must reorient the fiber to the stone for additional laser irradiation. This cumbersome process makes the procedure inconvenient and difficult and eventually prolongs the operation time. This study is designed to quantify the retropulsive momentum during pulsed laser lithotripsy.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2001/HTD-24429/6797174/93_1_imece2001-htd-24429.pdf",""

The purpose of these studies was to determine the extent to which this fundamental relationship applies to other nonsurfactants. Ten μl of acetone (ACT), cyclohexanol (CY), parafluoroaniline (PF), or 37% formaldehyde (FA) was directly applied to the cornea of the right eye of each rabbit. Eyes and eyelids were macroscopically scored for signs of irritation beginning 3 hours after dosing and periodically until recovery or 35 days. Tissues were obtained for light microscopic examination after 3 hours and on days 1, 3, and 35. Initial corneal injury was characterized quantitatively at 3 hours and 1 day using in vivo confocal microscopy (CM) and by postmortem quantitation of dead corneal epithelial cells and keratocytes using a Live—Dead Assay (L/D, Molecular Probes) and scanning laser CM. Corneal changes over time were characterized quantitatively using in vivo CM performed at 3 hours and 1, 3, 7, 14, and 35 days. The changes with ACT were consistent with mild irritation. Corneal injury was limited to the epithelium and superfi cial stroma, with the mean normalized depth of injury (NDI) being less than 10% with the majority of regions showing no stromal injury. Changes with CY and PF were consistent with moderate to severe irritation, and FA caused severe irritation. Specifi cally, corneal injury by CY and PF tended to involve the epithelium and anterior stroma, with the mean NDI being 10.4% to 23.8%, while injury with FA involved the epithelium, deep stroma, and at times the endothelium. Interestingly, with FA significantly less injury was observed at 3 hours with a dramatic increase in injury observed at 1 day and thereafter. In conclusion, these results continue to support and extend our hypothesis that ocular irritation is principally defined by the extent of initial injury despite clear differences in the means by which irritants cause tissue damage. We believe this approach can be applied to developing alternative assays based on injury to ex vivo eyes or injury to an in vitro corneal equivalent system.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/019262301317052468",""

Although the mechanism of phosgene formation is believed to be identical on the two surfaces, important differences in reactivity were observed. The phosgene production of oxygen modified Ir(111) was greater than the oxygen modified Ir(110) surface. Oxygen atoms are more tightly bound to the Ir(110) surface making it less reactive for the production of phosgene. Formation of the surface oxide on Ir(110) (which begins to occur if the surface is heated above 550 K) reduces adsorption of carbon tetrachloride, which necessarily decreases phosgene formation. The Ir(110) surface may also cause a more rapid decomposition of the adsorbed CCl2 intermediate.

It serves as a practical, cost-effective and robust tool for oilfield production and management. Well production, well spacing and the time-dependent information are used to train the neural network. The time-dependent information of wells are incorporated in a manner of time series for establishment of neural network. After the neural network is established, it is used to predict future performance of existing and infill wells. No reservoir data is currently used in the establishment of neural network, therefore it can predict well production performance in absence of reservoir data. Primary production of two data sets (each has 9 wells) in North Robertson Unit located in west Texas was tested using this approach. The results demonstrate that this approach is powerful in rapid projection of existing wells’ future performance, as well as the performance prediction of infill drilling wells.","https://onepetro.org/SPEWRM/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/68801-MS/2952828/spe-68801-ms.pdf",""

One interesting and important contributor to resolution is the “surface induction” phenomenon that occurs during development of many photoresist materials. This phenomenon is manifested by a change in dissolution rate as a function of thickness. The top or surface regions of these films dissolve more slowly than the bulk of the film for reasons that are not understood. One popular theory for surface induction is that the variation in rate is caused by a gradient in the concentration of residual casting solvent. However, no study has been performed that directly measured the concentration gradient in residual casting solvent and related that gradient to the extent of surface induction. A “halt development ” procedure has been developed that allows isolation and analysis of thin layers (slices) from resist films. The analysis for concentration of residual casting solvent was accomplished by radiolabeling the solvent and analyzing the layers by scintillation counting. The dissolution rate data was acquired by a multiwavelength interferometry technique. Two resists systems were studied, one with a large extent of surface inhibition and one with a nearly constant dissolution rate. Neither formulation has a significant concentration gradient of residual casting solvent over a range of bake temperatures (70–110 °C). Therefore, it can be concluded that concentration gradients in the residual casting solvent alone cannot account for the surface induction observed in this particular resist system.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-pdf/19/1/136/8204767/136_1_online.pdf",""

L. havardii is native to a narrow geographic range along the Mexican border in southwest Texas. The inflorescence of L. havardii has considerable potential in the cut flower industry where there is a need for high-quality, durable flowers with a blue color (1). Several crops have been produced in the greenhouse to determine production and post-harvest characteristics of the cut inflorescence. Under greenhouse growing conditions during March through June 1999, numerous plants of L. havardii cv. Texas Sapphire grown in raised beds and in containers in both Dallas and El Paso, TX, were observed with blighted flower racemes with light brown to gray lesions ranging from 1 to 5 cm in length. The racemes were attacked at varying ages and eventually assumed a hooked appearance where the terminal 15 cm of the raceme was bent downward. Isolations from symptomatic lesions removed from L. havardii flower stalks consistently yielded cultures of an Alternaria sp. on potato-dextrose agar. Typical conidia measured 27 μm length and 11 μm width with 3 to 5 transverse septa. The fungus was identified as A. alternata (Fries) Keissler consistent with the description in Ellis (2). Pathogenicity tests were conducted in the laboratory by inoculating cut inflorescences with agar disks containing the fungus. Inoculations produced light brown lesions on the racemes that were typical of disease symptoms observed on greenhouse crops. In addition to the blue-flowered Texas Sapphire cultivar, we also observed the disease symptoms on pink and white flowered breeding lines of L. havardii. This disease is important as a flower stem blighting pathogen and could severely restrict production of cut flowers during the growing season.

We abstract results from a 13-year study that focused on the extent to which long-term marital satisfaction and stability could be forecast from newlywed and early marital data. We explore the usefulness of three models emergent distress, enduring dynamics, and disillusionment designed to explain why some marriages thrive and others fail. The dominant paradigm, the emergent-distress model, sees newlyweds as homogeneously blissful and posits that distress develops as disagreements and negativity escalate, ultimately leading some couples to divorce. The results we summarize run counter to this model and suggest instead that (a) newlyweds differ considerably in the intensity of both their romance and the negativity of their behavior toward one another and, for those who remain married, these early dynamics persist over time; and (b) for couples who divorce, romance seems to deteriorate differently depending on how long the marriage lasts. Soon after their wedding, “early exiters” seem to lose hope of improving an unpromising relationship; “delayed-action divorcers” begin marriage on a particularly high note, yet quickly show signs of disillusionment. These delayed-action divorcers reluctantly give up on the marriage long after the romance has faded.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1467-8721.00129",""

Agents that suppress estrogen production are given with agents that suppress estrogenic activity at the cellular level. Historically, these combinations have resulted in initial improvements in response rates, but relapse-free and overall survival were not significantly improved. Also, the increased toxicity seen with these regimens was limiting. New endocrine therapies with more potent activity and less toxicity have led to a resurgence of this idea in the management of breast cancer. Complete estrogen blockade has been compared with single-agent treatments in many different settings. The endocrine effects of this type of therapy are intriguing, but apparently do not readily predict a clinical advantage. The combination of an aromatase inhibitor and an antiestrogen, despite pharmacokinetic interactions, may prove to be beneficial. Results from ongoing trials are eagerly awaited to further address this question in postmenopausal breast cancer patients. For premenopausal breast cancer patients the options are more complex. Clinical outcomes with leutinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists plus aromatase inhibitors are limited to very small phase II studies and are not clearly superior to single-agent therapy. Clinical data in the metastatic setting with premenopausal patients favor the use of an LHRH agonist with tamoxifen over the use of an LHRH agonist alone. However, a similar comparison with tamoxifen alone is lacking with only one trial including this as a treatment arm. Adjuvant therapy with this combined endocrine approach (LHRH agonist plus antiestrogen) has been more extensively studied, but lacks crucial comparisons necessary for making complex treatment decisions. Hopefully, through investigative diligence and ingenuity this issue can be adequately understood. However, many exciting new agents are on the horizon that offer hope to further advance the progress made to date although further confounding the questions already answered.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1634/theoncologist.6-6-538",""

One interesting and important contributor to resolution is the “surface induction” phenomenon that occurs during development of many photoresist materials. This phenomenon is manifested by a change in dissolution rate as a function of thickness. The top or surface regions of these films dissolve more slowly than the bulk of the film for reasons that are not understood. One popular theory for surface induction is that the variation in rate is caused by a gradient in the concentration of residual casting solvent. However, no study has been performed that directly measured the concentration gradient in residual casting solvent and related that gradient to the extent of surface induction. A “halt development ” procedure has been developed that allows isolation and analysis of thin layers (slices) from resist films. The analysis for concentration of residual casting solvent was accomplished by radiolabeling the solvent and analyzing the layers by scintillation counting. The dissolution rate data was acquired by a multiwavelength interferometry technique. Two resists systems were studied, one with a large extent of surface inhibition and one with a nearly constant dissolution rate. Neither formulation has a significant concentration gradient of residual casting solvent over a range of bake temperatures (70–110 °C). Therefore, it can be concluded that concentration gradients in the residual casting solvent alone cannot account for the surface induction observed in this particular resist system.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-pdf/19/1/136/8204767/136_1_online.pdf",""

RESULTS: The incidence of severe weight loss during RT was 32.7%, the incidence of dehydration was 10.9%, and the rate of prophylactic feeding gas‐trostomy tube placement was 32%. The patients most likely to suffer severe weight loss included patients with tumor sites of nasopharynx and base of tongue, those treated with chemoradiation, and patients with severe pretreatment weight loss. Prophylactic feeding gastrostomy tube placement before RT significantly reduced the incidence of severe weight loss and hospitalization during RT. CONCLUSION: Severe weight loss and dehydration during RT for head and neck cancer is common. Prophylactic feeding gastrostomy tubes significantly reduce the incidence of severe weight loss and hospitalization for dehydration during RT when placed before onset of RT.

L. havardii is native to a narrow geographic range along the Mexican border in southwest Texas. The inflorescence of L. havardii has considerable potential in the cut flower industry where there is a need for high-quality, durable flowers with a blue color (1). Several crops have been produced in the greenhouse to determine production and post-harvest characteristics of the cut inflorescence. Under greenhouse growing conditions during March through June 1999, numerous plants of L. havardii cv. Texas Sapphire grown in raised beds and in containers in both Dallas and El Paso, TX, were observed with blighted flower racemes with light brown to gray lesions ranging from 1 to 5 cm in length. The racemes were attacked at varying ages and eventually assumed a hooked appearance where the terminal 15 cm of the raceme was bent downward. Isolations from symptomatic lesions removed from L. havardii flower stalks consistently yielded cultures of an Alternaria sp. on potato-dextrose agar. Typical conidia measured 27 μm length and 11 μm width with 3 to 5 transverse septa. The fungus was identified as A. alternata (Fries) Keissler consistent with the description in Ellis (2). Pathogenicity tests were conducted in the laboratory by inoculating cut inflorescences with agar disks containing the fungus. Inoculations produced light brown lesions on the racemes that were typical of disease symptoms observed on greenhouse crops. In addition to the blue-flowered Texas Sapphire cultivar, we also observed the disease symptoms on pink and white flowered breeding lines of L. havardii. This disease is important as a flower stem blighting pathogen and could severely restrict production of cut flowers during the growing season. This is the first report of Alternaria sp. attacking L. havardii.","https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/abs/10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.2.231A",""

We abstract results from a 13-year study that focused on the extent to which long-term marital satisfaction and stability could be forecast from newlywed and early marital data. We explore the usefulness of three models emergent distress, enduring dynamics, and disillusionment designed to explain why some marriages thrive and others fail. The dominant paradigm, the emergent-distress model, sees newlyweds as homogeneously blissful and posits that distress develops as disagreements and negativity escalate, ultimately leading some couples to divorce. The results we summarize run counter to this model and suggest instead that (a) newlyweds differ considerably in the intensity of both their romance and the negativity of their behavior toward one another and, for those who remain married, these early dynamics persist over time; and (b) for couples who divorce, romance seems to deteriorate differently depending on how long the marriage lasts. Soon after their wedding, “early exiters” seem to lose hope of improving an unpromising relationship; “delayed-action divorcers” begin marriage on a particularly high note, yet quickly show signs of disillusionment. These delayed-action divorcers reluctantly give up on the marriage long after the romance has faded.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1467-8721.00129",""

The philosophy of the present paper is to use the high accuracy of refractive index measurements to further test this model. It is shown that a very simple linear dependence with respect to temperature and pressure of the specific refractions LI and LII of the two contributing structural components in this two-state model is sufficient to give better than 5-decimal-point agreement with the experimental refractive index data at low pressures and temperatures between about −10 °C and +70 °C. The maximum in the refractive index between −5 °C and +5 °C is reproduced to an even better precision. Generally better than 4-decimal-point accuracy is achieved for higher pressures, where the experimental data are less accurately known. The pressure dependence considered here also allows the calculation of the isothermal piezo-optic coefficient as a function of temperature, which exhibits a minimum near 50 °C.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/114/7/3157/19157100/3157_1_online.pdf",""

These included reentrant phases (Ni76−xPdx)Mn24, for 0⩽x⩽5, and Ni75Mn23Pd2, a pure spinglass phase. The studies were performed over the temperature range 3–300 K. Low-field magnetization measurements show the irreversibility effect (MZFC and MFC diverge) at temperatures below the Curie temperature Tc. In Ni75Mn23Pd2, MZFC falls below MFC, as usually observed. However, in reentrant compositions, MZFC crosses MFC upon warming into the ferromagnetic regime, where it stays above MFC at temperatures below Tc. This unusual behavior is attributed to a model of Imry and Ma in which, in a ferromagnet with antiferromagnetic impurities, the impurities can couple to the host ferromagnetic alignment and force the system to break into domains antiferromagnetically coupled to each other. Field-cooled hysteresis measurements indicate the uniaxial anisotropy in these samples to be small, in contrast with the rigid uniaxial anisotropy reported for the corresponding polycrystalline bulk samples. Since the lattice-orbit coupling is weak in the amorphous phase, this clearly demonstrates that the physical origin of the unidirectional anisotropy is associated with the spin-orbit coupling.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/89/11/7044/19011090/7044_1_online.pdf",""

The present study was undertaken to determine whether abnormalities in insulin-signaling events are present in normoglycemic, nonobese subjects with a strong family history of type 2 diabetes. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps with percutaneous muscle biopsies were performed in eight normoglycemic relatives of type 2 diabetic patients (FH+) and eight control subjects who had no family history of diabetes (FH−), with each group matched for age, sex, body composition, and ethnicity. The FH+ group had decreased insulin-stimulated glucose disposal (6.64 ± 0.52 vs. 8.45 ± 0.54 mg · kg−1 fat-free mass · min−1; P &lt; 0.05 vs. FH−). In skeletal muscle, the FH+ and FH− groups had equivalent insulin stimulation of insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast, the FH+ group had decreased insulin stimulation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 tyrosine phosphorylation (0.522 ± 0.077 vs. 1.328 ± 0.115 density units; P &lt; 0.01) and association of PI 3-kinase activity with IRS-1 (0.299 ± 0.053 vs. 0.466 ± 0.098 activity units; P &lt; 0.05).

Two methods of evaluation are presented. The first is based on a dynamical analog. It is shown that the transformation can be evaluated from the set of equations that are identical to the set of equations that determine the four-velocity of a charged particle in response to a combined spatially uniform and temporally constant electric field E and magnetic field B, where E is parallel to ξ and B is antiparallel to ω, and E/B=ξ/ω. The principal difference in the two problems is that in the dynamics problem, the initial conditions for the four-velocity u must satisfy the constraint, uu=1, whereas the inner product of the coordinates acted on by eL can have any real value. In order to evaluate eL, one can then apply the simplifying techniques of transforming to the frame where E is parallel or antiparallel to B, whereupon the transformation eL in this special frame is trivially evaluated. Then we transform back to the original frame. We determine the β and the rotation Ω that results from a successive boost and rotation that the operator eL produces. A second method is based on a direct summation of the power series of the matrix elements of eL that has been used in relativistic quantum theory. The summation is facilitated by observing that the operators J±≡K±iS commute with each other, and can be represented in terms of the Pauli spin matrices. Indeed, we can reduce the Lorentz transformation to the product of spinor operators to give a compact way to compute the elements of the Lorentz operator eL.","https://pubs.aip.org/aapt/ajp/article-pdf/69/9/996/7529876/996_1_online.pdf",""

We hypothesized that increased fatty acid availability would increase the expression and activity of heart and skeletal muscle MCD, thereby promoting fatty acid utilization. The results show that high-fat feeding, fasting, and streptozotocin-induced diabetes all significantly increased the plasma concentration of nonesterified fatty acids, with a concomitant increase in both rat heart and skeletal muscle MCD mRNA. Upon refeeding of fasted animals, MCD expression returned to basal levels. Fatty acids are known to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα). Specific PPARα stimulation, through Wy-14643 treatment, significantly increased the expression of MCD in heart and skeletal muscle. Troglitazone, a specific PPARγ agonist, decreased MCD expression. The sensitivity of MCD induction by fatty acids and Wy-14643 was soleus > extensor digitorum longus > heart. High plasma fatty acids consistently increased MCD activity only in solei, whereas MCD activity in the heart actually decreased with high-fat feeding. Pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy, in which PPARα expression is decreased (and fatty acid oxidation is decreased), resulted in decreased MCD mRNA and activity, an effect that was dependent on fatty acids. The results suggest that fatty acids induce the expression of MCD in rat heart and skeletal muscle. Additional posttranscriptional mechanisms regulating MCD activity appear to exist.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpendo.2001.280.3.E471",""

The sequestration of CO2 is a secondary objective of these proposed projects. Mixtures of CO2 and NGL with the crude oil show a large three-phase liquid-liquid-gas region, so three and four-phase flow may occur in the reservoir when water is alternated with the miscible injectant. A compositional EOS simulator has been used to simulate the oil recovery for both three-phase and four-phase flow cases. The objective was to understand how important it is to simulate four-phase flow rather than use a three-phase flow approximation. Two methods were used to model three and four-phase relative permeabilities from two-phase relative permeabilities as well as to evaluate the sensitivity of the results to the relative permeability parameters. A two-dimensional vertical cross-section of the reservoir was modeled with a stochastic permeability field to approximate heterogeneities. These simulations clearly show that under these conditions, four-phase flow is significant. Four-phase flow occurs over a significant part of the reservoir and affects both the sweep efficiency and the injection and production rates when the wells are pressure constrained and the production pressure corresponds to the three-phase region of the phase diagram. The results are also very sensitive to the relative permeability parameters regardless of which relative permeability model is assumed. The project life is particularly sensitive to the relative permeability and is longer for four-phase flow than predicted by a three-phase flow approximation because the relative permeability of each phase is lower when four phases are modeled.","https://onepetro.org/SPEATCE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/71485-MS/2937108/spe-71485-ms.pdf",""

Changes in the levels of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodGuo), an index of DNA damage, and the levels of malondialdehyde + 4-hydroxyalkenals, an index of lipid peroxidation, were measured in kidneys, liver, and testes from hamsters treated with E2 (75 mg/kg body wt) and were collected 3 or 5 hr later. Other animals were treated with melatonin (15 mg/kg body wt, 30 min before and 120 min after E2 treatment) or were given both compounds. Additionally, lipid peroxidation was measured in liver homogenates exposed to ferrous sulfate (15 μM) in vitro. E2 treatment caused an increase in 8-oxodGuo levels in kidneys collected 5 hr after E2 administration, and in liver 3 hr after estrogen treatment. Melatonin completely prevented E2-induced DNA damage in both organs. Melatonin alone or when given with E2 and examined 3 hr later decreased the base level of 8-oxodGuo in testes. A tendency for a reduction in in vivo lipid peroxidation was observed after treatment of hamsters with either melatonin, E2, or both compounds, with a statistically significant decrease being measured in the liver following E2 administration. In vitro exposure to iron significantly enhanced lipid peroxidation in hepatic homogenates from untreated, melatonin-treated, or E2-injected hamsters; in the hepatic homogenates of hamsters given both E2 and melatonin, ferrous sulfate failed to augment lipid peroxidation. Our results confirm the dual actions of estrogens relative to oxidative damage, i.e., estrogen increases oxidative destruction of DNA while reducing lipid peroxidation. Melatonin had antioxidative actions in reducing oxidative damage to both DNA and to membrane lipids.

We recently showed that cardiomyocytes secrete tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), a response that was enhanced by burn trauma. This study addressed the question: does HSD modulate cardiac contraction/relaxation by altering cardiomyocyte TNF-α secretion? Wistar-Furth rats (325 g) were given a burn injury over 40% of the total body surface area and were then randomized to receive a bolus of either isotonic saline or HSD (4 ml/kg, n = 14 rats/group). Sham burn rats were given either isotonic saline or HSD ( n = 14 rats/group) to provide appropriate controls for the two burn groups. Hearts were isolated 24 h postburn for either Langendorff perfusion ( n = 8 hearts/group) or to prepare cardiomyocytes ( n = 6 hearts/group). Myocytes were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (0, 10, 25, or 50 μg for 18 h) to measure cytokine secretion. Burn trauma increased myocyte TNF-α and interleukin-1β and -6 secretion, exacerbated cytokine response to LPS stimulus, and impaired cardiac contraction. HSD treatment of burns decreased cardiomyocyte cytokine secretion, decreased responsiveness to LPS challenge with regard to cytokine secretion, and improved ventricular function. These data suggest that HSD mediates cardioprotection after burn trauma, in part, by downregulating cardiomyocyte secretion of inflammatory cytokines.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpheart.2001.280.4.H1591",""

Time-resolved imaging showed the location of the initial breakdown and the shockwave motion over its first 300 μm of expansion. From these measurements, we determined the shockwave velocity dependence on laser fluence. Measured shockwave velocities were in the range of 1–10 km/s. We also developed a numerical model that simulated breakdown in the glass microsphere and the propagation of this disturbance through the edge of the sphere where it could launch an air shock. Our objective was to simulate the shockwave velocity dependence on laser fluence and to generate glass density, temperature, and mass velocity profiles after breakdown.

It is identical to the asparaginyl endopeptidase legumain. During maturation of OIP-2, a signal peptide and a 17-kDa C-terminal fragment (CTF) are cleaved to produce the mature enzyme. To determine if enzyme activity is required for inhibition of OCL formation or if only the CTF is responsible for these effects, we synthesized His-tagged complementary DNA (cDNA) constructs for the CTF of OIP-2, the proform of OIP-2, and the “mature enzyme” form of OIP-2. The proform or the CTF portion of OIP-2 inhibited OCL formation in a dose-dependent manner in murine bone marrow cultures stimulated with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3]. The mature form of OIP-2, which was enzymatically active, did not inhibit OCL formation. In addition, OIP-2 inhibited OCL formation in cultures of highly purified human OCL precursor cells or RAW264.7 cells stimulated with 10 ng/ml of receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) ligand. Binding studies with His-tagged OIP-2 showed expression of a putative OIP-2 receptor on RAW264.7 cells treated with RANK ligand for 4 days and human marrow cultures treated with 1,25(OH)2D3 for 3 weeks. These data show that the CTF of OIP-2, rather than the mature enzyme, mediates the inhibitory effects of OIP-2 through a putative receptor on OCL precursors.","https://academic.oup.com/jbmr/article-pdf/16/10/1804/56603958/5650161010.pdf",""

Other works investigated are the development of the Buckley-Leverett concept of fluid displacement, the laboratory determination of relative permeability, and the development of waterflood scaling theory aimed directly toward calculating reservoir performance from laboratory data. This paper reviews waterflood management practices in West Texas and provides ways of implementing successful waterflood project.","https://onepetro.org/SPEPBOGR/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/70039-MS/2951291/spe-70039-ms.pdf",""

Central to this model is the use of thermalized gaseous disilane adsorption probabilities that have been determined as a function of gas and surface temperature by convoluting supersonic molecular beam adsorption probability data with a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution of incident kinetic energies and angles. These calculations show that the primary adsorption pathway over the entire range of conditions investigated is the so-called trapping-mediated mechanism, in which dissociative chemisorption occurs via a physisorbed intermediate. A second adsorption mechanism, direct chemisorption, is activated by translational energy and does in fact contribute somewhat to adsorption, but only at high gas and surface temperatures. Hydrogen coverages and silicon film growth rates are calculated from a simple surface decomposition kinetic model together with a phenomenological thermal desorption model and compare favorably to experimental measurements. Under conditions of high flux or low surface temperature, the growth rate is limited by hydrogen desorption and therefore increases with increasing surface temperature. In the flux-limited or adsorption-limited growth regime, the growth rate is predicted to decrease with increasing surface temperature due to a drop in the adsorption probability, resulting in a maximum in the growth rate for a given set of deposition conditions.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/90/10/4981/19013267/4981_1_online.pdf",""

We examined the effects of isometric exercise by different muscle masses on skin blood flow (SkBF) and sweat rate (SR) in nonglabrous skin and in glabrous skin. The latter contains arteriovenous anastomoses (AVAs), which cause large fluctuations in SkBF. SkBF was measured by laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) and reported as cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC; LDF/mean arterial pressure). SR was measured by capacitance hygrometry. LDF and SR were measured at the sole, palm, forearm, and ventral leg during separate bouts of isometric handgrip (IHG) and isometric leg extension (ILE). CVC and its standard deviation decreased significantly during IHG and ILE in the palm and sole ( P < 0.05) but not in the forearm or leg ( P > 0.05).

We obtained a “response area” for each neuron, defined as the frequency range that evoked discharges and the spike counts evoked by those frequencies at a constant intensity. We then iontophoretically applied serotonin and compared response areas obtained before and during the application of serotonin. In 58 cells, we also assessed how serotonin-induced changes in response areas correlated with changes in the responses to brief frequency-modulated (FM) sweeps whose structure simulated natural echolocation calls. Serotonin profoundly changed tone-evoked spike counts in 60% of the neurons (68/114). In most neurons, serotonin exerted a gain control, facilitating or depressing the responses to all frequencies in their response areas. In many cells, serotonergic effects on tones were reflected in the responses to FM signals. The most interesting effects were in those cells in which serotonin selectively changed the responsiveness to only some frequencies in the neuron's response area and had little or no effect on other frequencies. This caused predictable changes in responses to the more complex FM sweeps whose spectral components passed through the neurons' response areas. Our results suggest that serotonin, whose release varies with behavioral state, functionally reconfigures the circuitry of the IC and may modulate the perception of acoustic signals under different behavioral states.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jn.2001.85.2.828",""

The large change in work function (almost a factor of 2) could be useful to make conductors with different work functions for microelectronic gate structures.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article-pdf/79/17/2835/18561380/2835_1_online.pdf",""

We first divided the extended families into nuclear families. The first method fitted variance components to the martingale residuals, which were obtained from first fitting a proportional hazards model to the time to onset data for the trait, allowing for the quantitative traits Q1–Q5, sex, age, and the environmental factor. The second method treated time to onset among the affected individuals as a quantitative trait adjusting for the same factors as in the first method. Power of these analyses were similar for either approach. However, we found an excess of false‐positive results when fitting the martingale residual model or the affected‐only model to identify genetic factors linked to chromosome 6. Applying a power transformation to the martingale residuals decreased the type I error rate and increased the power of tests for genetic linkage. We also found that robust variance correction lead to tests with a slightly lower type I error rate, perhaps because the robust variance correction adjusts for the fact that we did not specifically model the effects of the mitochondrial factor in our analysis. © 2001 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fgepi.2001.21.s1.s768",""

Methods and results: The English language literature on laparoscopic staging of pancreatic cancer was reviewed. Interpretation of this literature on staging laparoscopy is difficult because (1) there has been inconsistent use of high-quality computed tomography (CT) in prospective studies, (2) many studies have included patients with locally advanced disease, and (3) the R0/R1/R2 resection rates among patients staged by laparoscopy have not been reported, making it impossible to correlate laparoscopic findings with the R0 resection rate. Laparoscopy may prevent unnecessary laparotomy in a proportion of CT-staged patients presumed to have resectable pancreatic cancer. However, routine laparoscopy is performed on patients judged to have resectable disease by high-quality CT, this fraction of patients is between 4 and 13 per cent. Conclusion: When state-of-the-art CT is available, the routine use of staging laparoscopy may not be easily justified from the data in the recent literature. Selective use of laparoscopy may be more appropriate and will probably be a more cost-effective staging approach. Criteria are presented for the selective use of laparoscopy in the staging of patients with localized pancreatic cancer.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1046%2Fj.1365-2168.2001.01695.x",""

OBJECTIVE: We expand on this earlier study and continue to investigate the feasibility of this model in a subset of patients with inhalant allergy and Meniere's disease after immunotherapy. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study of 11 patients identified with both Meniere's disease and inhalant allergy in the practices of 2 neurotologists at our institution. Patients underwent a baseline ECoG, followed by intranasal challenge with the allergen to which they were most sensitive. This was followed by a second ECoG. RESULTS: Six of 11 patients had at least 1 year of immunotherapy (group 1), and 5 of 11 had had 0 to 6 months of immunotherapy (group 2). Four of 6 group 1 patients had a >15% increase in SP/AP ratio after immunotherapy. In group 2, 2 patients increased the SP/AP in at least 1 ear. No patient with a normal ECoG experienced vestibular symptoms after allergen challenge, whereas 2 of group 1 and 2 of group 2 had vestibular symptoms with abnormal ECoGs. CONCLUSION: This protocol is a useful tool for investigating the relationship of inhalant allergy and Meniere's disease, but needs a larger group of patients and further study to draw valid statistical conclusions.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1067/mhn.2001.119142",""

Skeletal muscle cells and keratinocytes target caveolin-1 to the cytosol while in exocrine and endocrine cells it accumulates in the secretory pathway. We also found that airway epithelial cells accumulate caveolin-1 in modified mitochondria. The cytosolic and the secreted forms appear to be incorporated into a soluble, lipid complex.

Activation of CFTR by PKA stimulation appears to be mediated by a complex interaction between several consensus phosphorylation sites in the regulatory domain (R domain). None of these sites has a critical role in this process. Here, we show that although endogenous phosphorylation by PKC is required for the effect of PKA on CFTR, stimulation of PKC by itself has only a minor effect on human CFTR. In contrast, CFTR from the amphibians Necturus maculosus and Xenopus laevis (XCFTR) can be activated to similar degrees by stimulation of either PKA or PKC. Furthermore, the activation of XCFTR by PKC is independent of the net charge of the R domain, and mutagenesis experiments indicate that a single site (Thr665) is required for the activation of XCFTR. Human CFTR lacks the PKC phosphorylation consensus site that includes Thr665, but insertion of an equivalent site results in a large activation upon PKC stimulation. These observations establish the presence of a novel mechanism of activation of CFTR by phosphorylation of the R domain, i.e., activation by PKC requires a single consensus phosphorylation site and is unrelated to the net charge of the R domain.","https://rupress.org/jgp/article-pdf/117/5/457/1776440/8372.pdf",""

The objective of this report is to further define these findings as they relate to this disease. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review of 142 patients with AFRS diagnosed using the Bent‐Kuhn criteria. All patients were treated at a single institution. RESULTS: Approximately 20% of patients with AFRS demonstrated bone erosion on CT scan. The ethmoid sinus was the most commonly eroded site. The orbit and anterior cranial fossa were the most common adjacent anatomic spaces to exhibit disease extension. Sinus expansion, not the specific organism identified, was associated with the presence of bone erosion. Surgical management with endoscopic techniques was successful for all patients without any major perioperative complications. CONCLUSION: Bone erosion can be related to AFR. Recognition of this possibility is important because bone erosion can be interpreted as an indication of invasive pathosis. In the presence of bone erosion or disease extension, endoscopic techniques can be used to surgically manage this disease.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1067/mhn.2001.112573",""

It is unknown what enzyme or other factor in the extracellular organelles is responsible for the activation. This study tested the hypothesis that enzymes present in matrix vesicles can activate latent TGF-β1 and that this is regulated by 1α,25(OH)2D3. To do this, we examined the ability of matrix vesicle extracts to activate small latent rhTGF-β1. In addition, enzymes previously determined to be present in matrix vesicles were screened for their ability to activate small latent rhTGF-β1. Recombinant human matrix metalloproteinase 2 (rhMMP-2; 72 kDa gelatinase), rhMMP-3 (stromelysin 1), purified human plasminogen, and purified urokinase (plasminogen activator) were each tested at varying concentrations. To assess the role of cell maturation, we used a cell culture model in which chondrocytes are derived from two distinct zones of rat costochondral cartilage, the resting zone and the growth zone. Matrix vesicles were isolated from these cultures and then tested. The results showed that extracts of matrix vesicles produced by both growth zone and resting zone chondrocytes were able to activate small latent rhTGF-β1. The effects were dose and time dependent, with greater activity being found in extracts of matrix vesicles from the growth zone chondrocyte cultures. Only rhMMP-3 was able to activate small latent rhTGF-β1, indicating that stromelysin-1, but not MMP-2, plasminogen, or urokinase, was involved. As observed in the extracts, the effect of rhMMP-3 was time and dose dependent. When anti-MMP-3 antibody was added to matrix vesicle extracts from both cell types, activation of small latent rhTGF-β1 was dose-dependently blocked. Neither 1α,25(OH)2D3 nor 24R,25(OH)2D3 had a direct effect on activation of small latent rhTGF-β1 by the extracts. However, when intact matrix vesicles were treated with 1α,25(OH)2D3, their ability to activate small latent rhTGF-β1 was increased. Inhibition of phospholipase A2 with quinacrine blocked the 1α,25(OH)2D3-dependent effect. These results suggest that the ability of 1α,25(OH)2D3-treated matrix vesicles to activate small latent TGF-β1 is via action of the secosteroid on the matrix vesicle membrane, not on the enzymes responsible for activating latent TGF-β1. Because matrix vesicles isolated from growth zone chondrocytes have been shown to contain increased phospholipase A2 activity after treatment with 1α,25(OH)2D3, it is likely that this secosteroid promotes loss of membrane integrity through phospholipase A2-dependent formation of lysophospholipids, resulting in the release of MMP-3 into the matrix, where latent TGF-β1 is stored. Taken together, the results of the current study show that matrix vesicles produced by growth plate chondrocytes contain MMP-3, that this enzyme is at least partially responsible for activation of small latent TGF-β1 in the matrix, and that 1α,25(OH)2D3 regulates MMP release from matrix vesicles.","https://academic.oup.com/jbmr/article-pdf/16/7/1281/56606838/5650160711.pdf",""

ADAM8 was one of the 50 genes identified. ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) peptides are membrane-bound proteins that can act as cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix adhesion molecules, degrade the extracellular matrix, and play a role in tissue morphogenesis. Addition of antisense (AS) S-oligonucleotides for ADAM8 (1-10 nM) to mouse bone marrow cultures treated with 10−9 M 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] significantly inhibited OCL formation compared with treatment with the control S-oligonucleotide. Furthermore, conditioned media from 293 cells transiently transfected with a secretable form of the ADAM8 cDNA increased OCL formation in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, treatment of OCLs with soluble ADAM8 conditioned media significantly increased pit formation per dentin slice compared with control OCLs. Time course studies indicated that ADAM8 increased OCL formation only when it was present during days 4-7 of the 7-day culture period. Structural analysis, using truncated constructs of ADAM8, showed that the cysteine-rich/disintegrin domain was responsible for its OCL stimulatory activity. Western blot analysis confirmed that the soluble form of ADAM8 is present in normal marrow cultures. These data suggest that ADAM8 plays an important role in OCL formation and acts primarily at the later stages of OCL differentiation.","https://academic.oup.com/jbmr/article-pdf/16/5/814/56605946/5650160503.pdf",""

For other interlayer thicknesses, the coupling strength decreases rapidly and cannot be explained by Néel’s “orange-peel” coupling and domain wall coupling.

A unique feature of the streamline-based production data integration has been the concept of a ‘travel time’ match that is analogous to seismic tomography and has allowed the use of efficient and proven techniques from geophysics. In this paper we propose a ‘generalized travel time’ inversion method for production data integration that is particularly well-suited for large-scale field applications with changing conditions. Instead of matching the production data directly, we minimize a ‘travel time shift’ derived by maximizing a cross-correlation between the observed and computed production response at each well. There are several advantages with our proposed method. First, it is general and extremely computationally efficient. The travel time sensitivities can be computed analytically using a single streamline simulation that can be orders of magnitude faster than a conventional reservoir simulator. Second, it is very robust and the minimization is relatively insensitive to the choice of the initial model. Finally, it is field-proven because we utilize efficient techniques from geophysical inverse theory.","https://onepetro.org/SPEATCE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/71333-MS/2936212/spe-71333-ms.pdf",""

Several approaches, involving polymer penetration and transport, have revealed limiting diameters for various pores. But, in general, these approaches do not indicate the locations of constrictions in the channel lumen. Here, we combine cysteine mutagenesis and chemical modification with sulfhydryl-reactive polymers to locate the constriction in the lumen of the staphylococcal α-hemolysin pore, a model protein of known structure. The rates of reaction of each of four polymeric reagents (MePEG-OPSS) of different masses towards individual single cysteine mutants, comprising a set with cysteines distributed over the length of the lumen of the pore, were determined by macroscopic current recording. The rates for the three larger polymers (1.8, 2.5, and 5.0 kD) were normalized with respect to the rates of reaction with a 1.0-kD polymer for each of the seven positions in the lumen. The rate of reaction of the 5.0-kD polymer dropped dramatically at the centrally located Cys-111 residue and positions distal to Cys-111, whether the reagent was applied from the trans or the cis side of the bilayer. This semi-quantitative analysis sufficed to demonstrate that a constriction is located at the midpoint of the pore lumen, as predicted by the crystal structure, and although the constriction allows a 2.5-kD polymer to pass, transport of a 5.0-kD molecule is greatly restricted. In addition, PEG chains gave greater reductions in pore conductance when covalently attached to the narrower regions of the lumen, permitting further definition of the interior of the pore. The procedures described here should be applicable to other pores and to related structures such as the vestibules of ion channels.","https://rupress.org/jgp/article-pdf/117/3/239/1775746/8339.pdf",""

We report our experience in the treatment of pediatric TEN patients with early debridement of necrotic skin and coverage with human allograft skin. Methods.: From 1984 to 2000, 15 children (6 girls, 9 boys, 7.2 ± 1.5 years) with a histologic diagnosis of TEN and involvement of &gt;30% total body surface area were treated at the Shriners Hospitals for Children in Galveston. All were treated in a specialized pediatric burn intensive care unit after our standard treatment protocol, including operative debridement of sloughing skin and allografting within 24 hours of admission. Outcome parameters were mortality, length of hospital stay, wound healing, clinical complications, causative drugs, corticosteroid use, and delay in referral to a burn center. Results.: Taking a new medication (antibiotics, anticonvulsive drugs) was associated with all cases of TEN. Patients who were treated with early debridement and coverage with allograft skin showed no wound infection, and overall mortality was 7%. Total length of hospital stay was 26 ± 3 days. Long-term sequelae were changes in skin pigmentation (100%), ophthalmologic problems (40%), and diffuse itching early after wound healing (53%). Conclusion.: Although a rare disease in children, TEN was managed successfully in a burn center environment, using early debridement and wound coverage with allograft skin as a biological dressing. The use of corticosteroids and referral patterns seems unchanged during the past 2 decades, indicating an additional need for information and education about the disease.","https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-pdf/108/5/1162/892960/pe1101001162.pdf",""

The method is applied to multiple holdup logs and to interpreting multiple passes of a spinner flowmeter. The new technique yields the statistically most accurate interpretation and also provides an estimate of the statistical error involved. Synthetic logs are used to prove that the method minimizes the error in the interpreted flow profiles. Field examples of multiphase log suites and multipass spinner flowmeter logs illustrate the applications of the new method.","https://onepetro.org/SPEATCE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/71729-MS/2939853/spe-71729-ms.pdf",""

Because of the sparseness of wellbore intersections of fractures, data analysis results in incomplete statistical characterization of the fracture population, leaving interwell characterization almost impossible. Using basic fracture mechanics models and a novel core-testing technique, we propose that the fundamental shape of fracture parameter distributions can be predicted, and that there is a characteristic, quantifiable relationship between fracture length, spacing and aperture. We have performed subcritical fracture growth tests on numerous core samples, using credit card sized specimens, demonstrating the ability to characterize fracture mechanics properties of rock on a bed by bed basis. Using the subcritical index, a parameter that quantifies the relationship between natural fracture propagation velocity and tip loading conditions, we can predict the degree of fracture spacing regularity or clustering for a given reservoir bed. This subcritical parameter, along with information on the number of initial natural flaws in a given rock type, allows us to quantify the expected length distribution of the fractures. Under many conditions, as verified from outcrop data, fracture length is theoretically expected to follow an exponential distribution. Since natural fracture length is typically unobservable in subsurface data, we derive relationships that relate fracture length to aperture and spacing, both more readily measurable quantities. With this information, matrix block size and fracture drainage continuity can be estimated for the purpose of flow simulation in a fractured reservoir.","https://onepetro.org/SPEATCE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/71342-MS/2935851/spe-71342-ms.pdf",""

The cross-sectional area is assumed to vary slowly but otherwise arbitrarily along the axis of the resonator, such that the Webster horn equation provides a reasonable one-dimensional model in the linear approximation. First, perturbation theory is used to derive an asymptotic formula for the natural frequencies as a function of resonator shape. The solution shows that each natural frequency can be shifted independently via appropriate spatial modulation of the resonator wall. Numerical calculations for resonators of different shapes establish the limits of the asymptotic formula. Second, the nonlinear interactions of modes in the resonator are investigated with Lagrangian mechanics. An analytical result is obtained for the amplitude-frequency response curve and nonlinear resonance frequency shift for the fundamental mode. For a resonator driven at its lowest natural frequency, it is found that whether hardening or softening behavior occurs depends primarily on whether the nonlinearly generated second-harmonic frequency is greater or less than the second natural frequency of the resonator. A fully nonlinear one-dimensional numerical code is used to verify the analytical result.","https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article-pdf/110/1/109/10680826/109_1_online.pdf",""

The model proposed that UDP-glucose was then channeled to cellulose synthase in the plasma membrane, and it implies that Suc availability in cellulose sink cells would affect the rate of cellulose synthesis. Therefore, if cellulose sink cells could synthesize Suc and/or had the capacity to recycle the fructose released by Suc synthase back to Suc, cellulose synthesis might be supported. The capacity of cellulose sink cells to synthesize Suc was tested by analyzing the Suc phosphate synthase (SPS) activity of three heterotrophic systems with cellulose-rich secondary walls. SPS is a primary regulator of the Suc synthesis rate in leaves and some Suc-storing, heterotrophic organs, but its activity has not been previously correlated with cellulose synthesis. Two systems analyzed, cultured mesophyll cells of Zinnia elegans L. var. Envy and etiolated hypocotyls of kidney beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), contained differentiating tracheary elements. Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L. cv Acala SJ-1) fibers were also analyzed during primary and secondary wall synthesis. SPS activity rose in all three systems during periods of maximum cellulose deposition within secondary walls. The Z. elegans culture system was manipulated to establish a tight linkage between the timing of tracheary element differentiation and rising SPS activity and to show that SPS activity did not depend on the availability of starch for degradation. The significance of these findings in regard to directing metabolic flux toward cellulose will be discussed.","http://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-pdf/127/3/1234/38686429/plphys_v127_3_1234.pdf",""

The model proposed that UDP-glucose was then channeled to cellulose synthase in the plasma membrane, and it implies that Suc availability in cellulose sink cells would affect the rate of cellulose synthesis. Therefore, if cellulose sink cells could synthesize Suc and/or had the capacity to recycle the fructose released by Suc synthase back to Suc, cellulose synthesis might be supported. The capacity of cellulose sink cells to synthesize Suc was tested by analyzing the Suc phosphate synthase (SPS) activity of three heterotrophic systems with cellulose-rich secondary walls. SPS is a primary regulator of the Suc synthesis rate in leaves and some Suc-storing, heterotrophic organs, but its activity has not been previously correlated with cellulose synthesis. Two systems analyzed, cultured mesophyll cells of Zinnia elegans L. var. Envy and etiolated hypocotyls of kidney beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), contained differentiating tracheary elements. Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L. cv Acala SJ-1) fibers were also analyzed during primary and secondary wall synthesis. SPS activity rose in all three systems during periods of maximum cellulose deposition within secondary walls. The Z. elegans culture system was manipulated to establish a tight linkage between the timing of tracheary element differentiation and rising SPS activity and to show that SPS activity did not depend on the availability of starch for degradation. The significance of these findings in regard to directing metabolic flux toward cellulose will be discussed.","http://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-pdf/127/3/1234/38686429/plphys_v127_3_1234.pdf",""

However, there is a paucity of data supporting the relevance of these observations to the in vivo situation. To test the hypothesis that such an interaction suppresses immune responses, we studied a line of transgenic C57BL/6 mice that express the HCV core and envelope proteins in the liver. The potential effects of these proteins on the hepatic immune response were evaluated by challenging these mice with a hepatotropic adenovirus. Both transgenic and nontransgenic mice developed similar courses of infection and cleared the virus from the liver by 28 days postinfection. Both groups of mice mounted similar immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgG2a, interleukin-2, and tumor necrosis factor alpha responses against the virus. Additionally, BALB/c mice were able to clear infection with recombinant adenovirus that does or does not express the HCV core and envelope 1 proteins in the same manner. These data suggest that HCV core and envelope proteins do not inhibit the hepatic antiviral mechanisms in these murine experimental systems and thus favor a model in which HCV circumvents host responses through a mechanism that does not involve general suppression of intrahepatic immune responses.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.75.24.11992-11998.2001",""

Solutions of the coupled equations are obtained using a powerful approach originally introduced in nuclear theory and also used to solve simple nonseparable problems in underwater acoustics. The basic integral equations are slightly modified to permit a Lanczos expansion to form a solution. The solution of the original set of integral equations is then easily recovered from the solution of the modified equations. Two important aspects of the integral equation method are revealed. First, the Lanczos expansion converges faster than a Born expansion of the original integral equations. Second, even when the Born expansion diverges due to strong mode coupling, the Lanczos expansion converges. It is shown that the internal wave problems examined are essentially one-way propagation problems because one observes good agreement between the coupled mode solutions and those provided by an energy-conserving parabolic equation algorithm. In the Workshop examples, at both 25 and 250 Hz, significantly greater coupling between modes occurs in the linear internal wave field case than the nonlinear soliton case.","https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S0218396X01000449",""

The adsorbed state and desorption kinetics of CHF2Cl are sensitive to the surface structure and, hence, the degree of crystallinity of ice. Chlorodifluoromethane binds more strongly to CI than ASW and desorbs at a higher temperature during thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS), altering the spectrum line shape and allowing differentiation between the two phases. Adsorbed states and thus the TDS line shape also respond to structural changes on the ASW surface prior to the onset of crystallization. The value of the condensation coefficient (α), a measure of CHF2Cl adsorption kinetics and dynamics, is high on both surfaces (∼1). However, a small but reproducible variation of α with the phase of solid water can be used to distinguish ASW from CI. The sensitivity of CHF2Cl adsorption and desorption to ice surface structure can contribute information about the phase and morphology of bulk ice, provided that the structure of the surface reflects that of the bulk.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jva/article-pdf/19/4/1537/10987265/1537_1_online.pdf",""

The structure consisted of 19 Å (5 ML) of Sr on a 10 Å SiOxNy barrier layer on a Si(100) substrate. Both XPS and SIMS results suggest that strontium oxide (SrO) and silicon dioxide (SiO2) at the Sr/SiOxNy interface form strontium silicate even at 300 K. The kinetics of this reaction were accelerated by heating the structure in a stepwise fashion to 1000 K. After the 500 K anneal, the SrO and SiO2 XPS chemical states attenuate leaving predominantly two silicate phases. Annealing the nanostructure to 1000 K tested the barrier capability of the 10 Å SiOxNy layer to Sr diffusion. SIMS Sr+, SrSi+, SrSiO+, and Sr2N+ signals reveal that Sr containing species do not significantly penetrate below the N≡Si3 bonds characteristic of SiOxNy. Comparison of 10 Å SiO2 and 10 Å SiOxNy confirms that the N≡Si3 bonds are the key to the barrier properties. Without N atoms, the SrSiO+ signal increased by a factor of 3.6 and penetrated 26 Å deeper into the Si substrate after a 900 K anneal. These results show that N atoms in the barrier layer retard Sr diffusion and silicate formation. Comparison of Ba and Sr on SiOxNy suggests that Ba is more likely to form silicide, whereas Sr is more likely to form silicate.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jva/article-pdf/19/5/2222/7450764/2222_1_online.pdf",""

Gastric myoelectrical activity was measured by using surface electrogastrography with a specially designed four-channel device. The study was performed for 30 min or more in the fasting state. Special computer programs were developed for the computation of the propagation and coupling of the gastric slow wave. It was found that, compared with the healthy controls, the patients showed a significantly lower percentage of slow wave propagation (58.0 ± 8.9 vs. 89.9 ± 2.6%, P < 0.002) and a significantly lower percentage of slow wave coupling (46.9 ± 4.4 vs. 61.5 ± 6.9%, P < 0.04). In addition, the patients showed inconsistencies in the frequency and regularity of the gastric slow wave among the four-channel electrogastrograms (EGGs).

The system is composed of a series of interconnected, synchronized flashing warning lights that produce the illusion of motion. Researchers investigated motorist understanding and perceived usefulness of various designs of the warning-light system, and the potential of this system to yield significant operational or safety benefits in actual work-zone applications. Results from proving ground and field studies show that the flashing warning-light system used in the work-zone lane closure is perceived positively and is not confusing to the motoring public. The field-study results also revealed that the prototype warning-light system may encourage motorists to vacate a closed travel lane farther upstream from the work zone (which is believed to offer a potential safety benefit). When the warning-light system was activated at the urban freeway test site, a relatively new closure, there was a one-fourth reduction in the number of passenger vehicles and a two-thirds reduction in the number of trucks in the closed lane 305 m (1,000 ft) upstream of the lane closure. However, the system did not significantly affect lane choice at the rural road test site where the lane closure had been installed for 6 months. Thus, the greatest potential safety benefit of the warning-light system may be when it is used in conjunction with short-duration or intermediate-term maintenance or construction projects.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/1745-05",""

Because our previous studies showed that the synthetic lipopeptide JBT3002 might activate macrophages via signaling pathways similar to those used by LPS, we investigated whether phospholipase activities are required for activation of macrophages by JBT3002. Treatment of RAW264.7 murine macrophage-like cells with JBT3002 stimulated expression of both inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in a dose-dependent manner. The JBT3002-induced production of nitric oxide and TNF-α was significantly inhibited by tricyclodecan-9-yl xanthogenate (D609), a selective inhibitor of phosphatidylcholine (PC)-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC). JBT3002-induced expression of steady-state mRNA for both iNOS and TNF-α was inhibited by D609. Cells treated with JBT3002 had greater production of diacylglycerol (DAG) in 2 min, which lasted for at least 30 min and could be blocked by D609. Activation of RAW264.7 cells was not affected by butanol, a PC-specific phospholipase D inhibitor, and treatment with JBT3002 did not affect phosphatidic acid formation. RAW264.7 cells treated with DAG analogue 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol, in the presence of interferon-γ, produced TNF-α. These results suggested that activation of RAW264.7 cells by JBT3002 requires PC-PLC activity.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1189/jlb.69.6.1060",""

This paper presents a self-consistent theory of the rf-wave propagation and ion motion through the resonance. An important ingredient of the problem is the ion flow along the magnetic field. The flow velocity limits the time the ions spend at the resonance, which in turn limits the ion energy gain. A feature that makes the problem nonlinear is that the flow accelerates under the effect of the ∇B force and rf-pressure. This acceleration can produce a steep decrease in the plasma density at the resonance, resulting in partial reflection of the incident wave.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pop/article-pdf/8/3/907/19006357/907_1_online.pdf",""

We have examined the prM/M and a portion of the E protein for a panel of 38 wild strains of YF virus from Africa representing different countries and times of isolation. Examination of the strains revealed a more complex genetic relationship than previously reported. Overall, nucleotide substitutions varied from 0 to 25.8% and amino acid substitutions varied from 0 to 9.1%. Phylogenetic analysis using parsimony and neighbor-joining algorithms identified five distinct genotypes: central/east Africa, east Africa, Angola, west Africa I, and west Africa II. Extensive variation within genotypes was observed. Members of west African genotype II and central/east African genotype differed by 2.8% or less, while west Africa genotype I varied up to 6.8% at the nucleotide level. We speculate that the former two genotypes exist in enzootic transmission cycles, while the latter is genetically more heterogeneous due to regular human epidemics. The nucleotide sequence of the Angola genotype diverged from the others by 15.7 to 23.0% but only 0.4 to 5.6% at the amino acid level, suggesting that this genotype most likely diverged from a progenitor YF virus in east/central Africa many years ago, prior to the separation of the other east/central African strains analyzed in this study, and has evolved independently. These data demonstrate that there are multiple genotypes of YF virus in Africa and suggest independent evolution of YF virus in different areas of Africa.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.75.15.6999-7008.2001",""

The purpose of this study was to determine if cognitive performance and middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (MCABFV) were altered in symptomatic Gulf War veterans (sGWVs) and asymptomatic Gulf War veterans (aGWVs) by exposure to low levels of acetone. MCABFV was assessed in male aGWVs (n=8) and sGWVs (n=8) during cognitive challenges while breathing 1) clean air, 2) a clean air placebo, and 3) a mixture of air and 40 parts per million (ppm) acetone. Pulmonary function was also evaluated. Pulmonary function tests showed no statistical differences between aGWVs and sGWVs while breathing clean air or 40 ppm acetone in air. Cognitive performance was similar during the clean air, placebo, and acetone test conditions for sGWVs and aGWVs. Data pooled across test conditions for each group indicated a statistically significant (P <0.05) poorer performance primarily in memory and executive function tasks by sGWVs. sGWVs had a 34.2% higher baseline MCABFV than aGWVs (P <0.05). Increases in MCABFV for aGWVs (averaged over all cognitive tasks for each test condition) ranged between 7.8% and 8.8%, and were not statistically significant. Increases for sGWVs ranged between 0.3% and 4.8%, averaged over all cognitive tasks for each test condition. No significant differences were noted between the clean air and placebo test conditions but both were significantly different compared to the acetone condition. Differences in MCABFV increases for each of the test conditions between aGWVs and sGWVs were also statistically significant. sGWV did not appear to demonstrate pulmonary dysfunction following exposure to acetone. They did, however, appear to have generally lower cognitive function as compared to aGWVs. sGWVs appeared to have a significant degree of autoregulatory disruption in cerebral perfusion, resulting in reduced cognitive reserve capacity and potentially impaired ability to handle complex cognitive tasks.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1191/0748233701th100oa",""

The structure consisted of 17 Å of (4 ML) Ba on a 12 Å SiOxNy barrier layer on a Si(100) substrate. Both XPS and SIMS results suggest that barium oxide (BaO) and silicon dioxide (SiO2) at the Ba/SiOxNy interface react to form ∼10 Å of multiphase barium silicate even at 300 K. The kinetics of this reaction were accelerated by annealing the structure in a stepwise fashion to 1000 K. During the annealing, the BaO and SiO2 XPS chemical states attenuate leaving two silicate states. Below the silicate layer, in the oxygen poor region of the nanostructure, ∼10 Å BaSix formed. Annealing the nanostructure to 1000 K for 5 min tested the barrier capabilities of the 12 Å SiOxNy layer. SIMS Ba+, BaSi+, BaSiO+ and Si2N+ signals reveal that Ba containing species do not significantly penetrate below the N≡Si3 bonds characteristic of SiOxNy. Comparison of ∼11 Å SiO2 and ∼12 Å SiOxNy, confirms that the N≡Si3 bonds are the key to the barrier properties. Without N atom incorporation, the Ba+ SIMS signal increased 66% and penetrated ∼24 Å deeper into the Si substrate after a 5 min 600 K anneal.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jva/article-pdf/19/1/207/8186486/207_1_online.pdf",""

In this work, plasma oxidation of three CuZr alloys (CuZr2, CuZr, and Cu51Zr14) has been studied using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and depth profiling methods. The dependence of the resulting oxide film on alloy composition and sample temperature during plasma oxidation is investigated. In contrast to thermal and electrochemical oxidation which lead to the formation of a zirconium oxide film, plasma oxidation leads to the formation of a copper oxide or metallic copper overlayer depending on temperature and copper concentration in the bulk. It is shown that plasma oxidation can be used to design oxide films at room temperature, which require high temperatures using thermal oxidation and are not achievable by anodic oxidation.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jva/article-pdf/19/4/1965/10988028/1965_1_online.pdf",""

XPS showed that copper (I) oxide (Cu2O) and copper (II) oxide (CuO) were reduced to copper metal at 400 K within a 30 min exposure to deuterium atoms (D*) and molecules at 1×10−4 Torr. Similarly, XPS showed that Cu2O was reduced to copper metal at 400 K within a 30 min exposure to methyl radicals (CH3*) and acetone molecules at 1×10−4 Torr. After D* exposure, TPD showed O leaves the Cu2O surface as D2O from 400 K to 700 K with a peak desorption temperature of 510 K. After CH3* exposure, TPD showed O leaves the Cu2O surface as CO2 over a range from 400 to 700 K with a peak temperature at 590 K. With carbon impurity below the XPS detection limit, thermal reduction of CuO to Cu2O was verified by XPS near 890 K. TPD experiments showed that O leaves the CuO surface as O2 at 890 K. Without surface C, thermal reduction of Cu2O was not observed up to 1073 K. Reduction of Cu2O without reactive radical species (D* or CH3*) was negligible.

Collision-induced absorption spectra of gaseous mixtures of deuterium hydride and helium in the rotational and fundamental bands of HD are calculated, for comparison with an existing measurement taken at a temperature of 77 K. To that end, we integrate the close-coupled, radial Schrödinger equations, accounting for the anisotropy of the HD–He interaction potential. The computed absorption spectra generally agree reasonably well with the observed spectral profiles and intensities of the collision-induced spectra. We also consider the interference phenomena of the HD permanent dipole with the interaction-induced, supramolecular dipole by computing the wings of various R(j) lines and of the P1(1) line in single, binary collision limit. For comparison, the line broadening and shift for the P and R line shape parameters are also computed using the impact approximation.

Serum IL-6 and IL-10 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assays from 159 and 151 CLL patients, respectively, and from healthy control subjects (n = 55 [IL-6]; n = 37 [IL-10]). Cytokine levels were correlated with clinical features and survival. Serum IL-6 levels were higher in CLL patients (median, 1.45 pg/mL; range, undetectable to 110 pg/mL) than in control subjects (median, undetectable; range, undetectable to 4.30 pg/mL) (P &lt; .0001). Serum IL-10 levels were higher in CLL patients (median, 5.04 pg/mL; range, undetectable to 74 pg/mL) than in normal volunteers (median, undetectable; range, undetectable to 13.68 pg/mL) (P &lt; .00001). Assays measuring both Epstein-Barr virus-derived and human IL-10 yielded higher values than assays measuring primarily human IL-10 (P &lt; .05). Patients with elevation of serum IL-6 or IL-10 levels, or both, had worse median and 3-year survival (log rank P &lt; .001) and unfavorable characteristics (prior treatment, elevated β2-microglobulin or lactate dehydrogenase, or Rai stage III or IV). Elevated IL-6 and IL-10 levels were independent prognostic factors for survival when analyzed individually or in combination (Cox regression analysis). However, if β2-microglobulin was incorporated into the analysis, it was selected as an independent prognostic feature, and IL-6/IL-10 were no longer selected. In patients with CLL, serum IL-6 and IL-10 (viral and human) levels are elevated and correlate with adverse disease features and short survival.

Controversy continues, however, over the ideal patch material. Bovine pericardium (Vascu-Guard Biovascular Inc., Saint Paul, MN) offers an attractive alternative to other patch materials because of its handling and suturing characteristics that are similar to that of autogenous material. This study examines the perioperative and midterm results of bovine pericardial patch angioplasty during CEA. We studied 112 patients who underwent 129 CEAs with bovine pericardial patch angioplasty during an 18-month period. Data were collected regarding demographics, operative indications, perioperative complications, and the occurrence of late adverse outcomes based primarily on follow-up arterial duplex studies. Among this group there were 63 male (56%) and 49 female (44%) patients whose mean age was 71.8 ± 9.1 years. In these patients there was the typical distribution of atherosclerotic risk factors. Seventy-four patients (66%) had symptomatic disease preoperatively and the remaining 38 patients (34%) were asymptomatic. Temporary cranial nerve palsy occurred in three patients (2%). There were no perioperative strokes, acute occlusions, bleeding episodes requiring reoperation, or deaths. The patients were followed up to 54 months postoperatively with a mean follow-up time of 41.7 ± 4.4 months. During this period two patients (2%) developed three significant restenoses (70–99%). All required reoperation. There were no asymptomatic occlusions, infections, aneurysms, or rupture. These data demonstrate that bovine pericardial patch angioplasty during CEA is associated with a low incidence of both perioperative and midterm adverse outcomes.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/000313480106700916",""

Younger age (&lt;60 yr), tremor, unilateral predominance, l-dopa responsiveness, motor fluctuations with dyskinesia, and good lesion placement predicted a good response to unilateral pallidotomy. Advanced age (&gt;70 yr), absence of tremor, increased duration of disease, reduced responsiveness to l-dopa, frontal behavioral changes, prominent apraxic phenomena, and improper lesion placement predicted a poor response. CONCLUSION: Unilateral, large-volume pallidotomy with precise lesion control provides long-lasting benefits for carefully selected patients.","http://academic.oup.com/neurosurgery/article-pdf/48/2/263/32549583/00006123-200102000-00002.pdf",""

The purpose of our paper is to draw on research in the judgment and decision-making arena to identify and analyze the behavioral implications of the new risk disclosures. We offer three conclusions. First, FRR No. 48 users may have more complex evaluations of risk than perhaps anticipated by the SEC. Second, the flexibility accorded firms in FRR No. 48 will adversely affect users' risk judgments. Third, because the Release does not require disclosure of certain quantitative information that is important to risk assessments, inappropriate risk assessments may result.

Myocardial heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70) increased 12.3-fold ( P < 0.05) in 9WK versus sedentary (SED) rats but was unchanged in the cold-room runners. Compared with SED rats, αB-crystallin was 90% higher in 9WKC animals, HSP 90 was 50% higher in 3WKC and 6WKC animals, and catalase was 23% higher in 3WK animals ( P < 0.05 for all). Cytosolic superoxide dismutase increased and mitochondrial SOD decreased ( P < 0.05) in 3WK and 6WK rats compared with 3WKC and 6WKC rats.

Following the cloning of mammalian Δ6‐desaturase (D6D), the D6D mRNA was found in many tissues, including adult brain, maternal organs, and fetal tissue, suggesting an active synthesis of HUFA in these tissues. The cloning also confirmed the long‐postulated hypothesis that the same pathway is followed in n−6 and n−3 HUFA synthesis. Dietary n−6 and n−3 HUFA both induce fatty acid oxidation enzymes in peroxisomes when compared to their respective precursor polyunsaturated fatty acids. This suggests that peroxisomes may be the primary site of HUFA degradation when HUFA are supplied in excess from the diet. Peroxisome proliferators strongly induce the enzymes for the HUFA synthesis. The mechanism of this induction is currently unknown. Recent studies revealed new HUFA functions that are not mediated by eicosanoids. These functions include endocytosis/exocytosis, ionchannel modulation, DNA polymerase inhibition, and regulation of gene expression. These new discoveries will enable us to reexamine the underlying mechanisms for the classical symptoms of essential fatty acid deficiency as well as vitamin E deficiency. Progress has also been made in understanding the mechanism by which dietary HUFA reduce body fat deposition. One mechanism is induction of genes for fatty acid oxidation, which is mediated by peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor‐α. Another likely mechanism is that HUFA suppress genes for fatty acid synthesis by reducing both mRNA and protein maturation of sterol regulatory element binding protein‐1.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1007/s11745-001-0806-5",""

The constraints were derived from general communicative factors as well as from the phonetic principles of perceptual distinctiveness and articulatory ease. Through evolutionary optimization, the model generated mock vocabularies optimized for the given constraints. Several simulations were run to understand how these constraints might define the emergence of universals and variation in complex sound systems. The predictions were that(1) CV syllables would be highly frequent in all vocabularies evolved under the constraints; (2) syllables with consonant clusters, consonant codas,and vowel onsets would occur much less frequently; (3) a relationship would exist between the number of syllable types in a vocabulary and the average word length in the vocabulary; (4) different syllable types would emerge according to, what we termed, an iterative principle of syllable structure and their frequency would be directly related to their complexity; and(5) categorical differences would emerge between vocabularies evolved under the same constraints. Simulation results confirmed these predictions and provided novel insights into why regularities and differences may occur across languages. Specifically, the model suggested that both language universals and variation are consistent with a set of functional constraints that are fixed relative to one another. Language universals reflect underlying constraints on the system and language variation represents the many different and equally-good solutions to the unique problem defined by these constraints.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/00238309010440010201",""

One of the inputs required is vehicle kilometers of travel (VKT) for each vehicle class as a function of average speed. This information traditionally has been obtained from macroscopic planning models whereby the average speed on a given length of roadway is the same for all vehicle classes. During the past 10 years, however, there has been a definite shift away from macro-level transportation modeling to a more simulation-based approach. In addition to the advances in modeling techniques, the advent of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) has opened numerous possibilities for capturing detailed transportation-related information. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the trade-offs involved under different aggregation scenarios for estimating vehicular emissions using data sets produced by microsimulation models and ITS. A 22-km section of Interstate 10 in Houston, Texas, was used as the test bed in this study. The VKT and speed data for this corridor were determined using a calibrated TRANSIMS model. This information was then used with the MOBILE5a emission model to compute emission estimates. The vehicular emissions were determined for a broad range of spatial, temporal, and combined spatial and temporal levels of disaggregation. It was found that emission estimates could vary by as much as 20 percent, depending on how the VKT and speed data are determined or depending on the type of ITS data-collection technology used.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/1750-07",""

The rib height-to-hydraulic diameter ratio (e/Dh) is 0.094 and the rib-pitch-to-height ratio (P/e) is 10. Two channel orientations are studied: β = 90° and β = 135° corresponding to the mid-portion and the trailing edge regions of a turbine blade, respectively. The focus of this study is twofold; namely, to investigate the effect of the channel aspect ratio and the channel orientation on the nature of the flow and heat transfer enhancement. A multi-block Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) method was employed in conjunction with a near-wall second-moment turbulence closure. In the present method, the convective transport equations for momentum, energy, and turbulence quantities are solved in curvilinear, body-fitted coordinates using the finite-analytic method. The numerical results compare reasonably well with experimental data for both stationary and rotating rectangular channels with rib turbulators at Reynolds number (Re) of 10,000, rotation number (Ro) of 0.11 and inlet coolant-to-wall density ratio (Δρ/ρ) of 0.115.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/GT/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/2001-GT-0187/2415720/v003t01a062-2001-gt-0187.pdf",""

We used recombinant adenovirus to infect CV1 cells with the mouse type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate 5-kinase α (PIP5KI), and identified the players that modulate the cytoskeleton in response to PIP2 signaling. PIP5KI overexpression increased PIP2 and reduced phosphatidylinositol 4 phosphate (PI4P) levels. It promoted robust stress-fiber formation in CV1 cells and blocked PDGF-induced membrane ruffling and nucleated actin assembly. Y-27632, a Rho-dependent serine/threonine protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, blocked stress-fiber formation and inhibited PIP2 and PI4P synthesis in cells. However, Y-27632 had no effect on PIP2 synthesis in lysates, although it inhibited PI4P synthesis. Thus, ROCK may regulate PIP2 synthesis by controlling PI4P availability. PIP5KI overexpression decreased gelsolin, profilin, and capping protein binding to actin and increased that of ezrin. These changes can potentially account for the increased stress fiber and nonruffling phenotype. Our results establish the physiological role of PIP2 in cytoskeletal regulation, clarify the relation between Rho, ROCK, and PIP2 in the activation of stress-fiber formation, and identify the key players that modulate the actin cytoskeleton in response to PIP2.","https://rupress.org/jcb/article-pdf/152/5/867/1512231/0011126.pdf",""

The housing market encompassing the North Central Expressway corridor in Dallas, Texas, is examined. Hedonic property price models are estimated for each specific phase of the reconstruction project between 1979 and 1997. Five phases are considered. Geographic information system (GIS) tools, like buffering and geocoding, enable spatial segmentation of property sales and improved model specification facilitated by the creation of different types of proximity variables. An econometric refinement is made to traditional hedonic models that, in conjunction with GIS, allows an examination of spatiotemporal fluctuations in location premiums and property-value trends. The results show that some parts are negatively affected and others are positively affected. This finding is in agreement with the findings of earlier studies. However, this study adds to this conclusion in many ways. The planning process itself mildly affected premiums for those further away. The short-term reconstruction effects are limited to those properties in the immediate vicinity. The results show that the losses in terms of sales discounts during initial phases of construction are made up in the latter phases for those in the immediate vicinity and rebounding property values.

Outcrossing in conifers is promoted via an embryo-lethal system, but the genetic mechanism is poorly understood. This study is the first experimental profile of the genetic mechanism promoting outcrossing in conifers. Molecular dissection of a Pinus taeda L. selfed pedigree detected a chromosomal region identified as PtTX3020-RPtest9. Within this region, a semilethal factor was tightly linked (r = 0.0076) to a polymorphic expressed sequence tag (EST). The linkage group flanking the lethal factor showed strong heterozygote advantage. Using genotypic frequencies for the linkage group, three hypotheses about the semilethal factor could be tested: (1) the presence of a balanced lethal system, i.e., a lethal factor present in each of the two marker intervals; (2) gametic selection operative prior to fertilization; and (3) a stage-specific lethal factor. Selection acted via the embryo-lethal system. No support for a genetic mechanism operating prior to fertilization was found. The semilethal factor exerted no effect after embryo maturity.

Surgical intervention is associated with considerable morbidity, and percutaneous angioplasty alone has demonstrated mixed results, with significant complications. Recent advances in stent technology have allowed for a novel treatment of symptomatic, medically refractory, vertebrobasilar artery stenosis. We report on a series of patients with medically refractory, posterior circulation stenosis who were treated with transluminal angioplasty and stenting at two medical centers in the United States. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of data for 11 consecutive patients with symptomatic, medically refractory, intracranial, vertebral or basilar artery stenosis was performed. All patients were treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting. Short-term clinical and angiographic follow-up data were obtained. RESULTS: Among 11 patients who were treated with stent-assisted angioplasty of the basilar or vertebral arteries, there were three periprocedural deaths and one delayed death after a pontine stroke. Other complications included a second pontine infarction, with subsequent residual diplopia. The remaining seven patients (64%) experienced symptom resolution and have resumed their preprocedural activities of daily living. Angiographic follow-up examinations demonstrated good patency of the stented lesions for five of seven survivors (71%); one patient exhibited minimal intrastent intimal hyperplasia, and another patient developed new stenosis proximal to the stent and also developed an aneurysm within the stented portion of the basilar artery. The last patient exhibited 40% narrowing of the treated portion of the vessel lumen. CONCLUSION: Recent advances in stent technology allow negotiation of the proximal posterior circulation vasculature. Although the treatment of vertebrobasilar artery stenosis with angioplasty and stenting is promising, long-term angiographic and clinical follow-up monitoring of a larger patient population is needed.","http://academic.oup.com/neurosurgery/article-pdf/48/6/1215/32553585/00006123-200106000-00002.pdf",""

Prominent among these animal models are rodents, most commonly rats and mice. In estimating bone mechanical properties in these animals, cortical bone is routinely assessed by bending one of the long bones such as the femur or tibia, which targets the mid-diaphysis region. Testing specimens of isolated cancellous bone is exceedingly challenging, however, even for the larger rat skeleton. Recognizing the prominence and importance of cancellous bone mechanical properties has led to increased mechanical testing of vertebra and femoral neck specimens in skeletal research employing rats and mice. The specimens in these tests actually consist of a combination of both cortical and cancellous tissue, however. In an attempt to more closely approximate the ideal of isolated cancellous bone specimens a method has been developed recently for testing specimens from the proximal tibia metaphysis and distal femoral metaphysis [1]. In either case, the specimen in this so-called “reduced-platen compression” (RPC) test consists of a section of the metaphysis containing both cortical and cancellous bone.

Numerically suitable equations for computing the solvent dynamical matrix (Hessian) for both ground and excited adiabatic electronic states are derived using analytical derivative methods of quantum chemistry. Standard diagonalization of the Hessian leads to the sets of eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors that underlie the INM theory. Comparison of the hydrated electron and pure water INM spectra and the corresponding mode participation ratios shows that the quantum solute enhances the participation of collective low-frequency unstable modes (imaginary frequencies) at the expenses of stable ones. Distinct differential INM spectra, involving distinct solvent configurational averages, are introduced to describe the changes experienced by the solvent INMs upon the vertical excitation of the electron. The overall picture is that the INMs associated with lower frequency translational and rotational motions, as well as fast librational reorientations are markedly affected by the photoexcitation, as opposed to the localized internal vibrations of the individual water molecules. The INM solvation response for the upward transition calculated from the real modes agrees with the response obtained directly from the energy gap time correlation up to approximately 100 fs. The agreement extends over much longer times for downward transitions. The INM analysis of the solvation responses following vertical upward and downward transitions reveals that diffusive translational and librational motions are both important mechanisms for the early stages (≲50 fs) of the solvent response, with the latter dominating the first half of this time period. It is also shown that the short-time solvent relaxation involves the combined motion of molecules from the first and second hydration shells. In addition, the linearized INM solvation response calculated for D2O indicates a significant (∼36%) solvent isotope effect in the first 25 fs of the response, where the decay is Gaussian. These results are compared with previous studies of the hydrated electron solvation dynamics.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/114/8/3598/19017140/3598_1_online.pdf",""

Human Hook3 bound to Golgi membranes in vitro and was enriched in the cis-Golgi in vivo. Unlike other cis-Golgi–associated proteins, however, a large fraction of Hook3 maintained its juxtanuclear localization after Brefeldin A treatment, indicating a Golgi-independent mechanism for Hook3 localization.

The reduced forms of the redox cofactors, NAD(H) and NADP(H), strongly enhance DNA binding of the Clock:BMAL1 and NPAS2:BMAL1 heterodimers, whereas the oxidized forms inhibit.

Capable of localized measurements from the plasma edge to the plasma core, the BES diagnostic collects light from the first Balmer transition (Hα) resultant from beam/plasma collisions. The Hα line splits into several components whose central wavelengths depend on the viewing geometry, the magnetic field, and the beam energy. This is due to the Doppler shifts from viewing the beam off perpendicular, the different velocities of the three mass components of the beam (H, H2, H3), and the large motional Stark effect. Optimal signal-to-noise requires collecting these components while attenuating all other emission: primarily bremsstrahlung and Dα radiation (from plasma D0/e− collisions). Tunable bandpass filters are thus required. A BES simulation code has been developed that calculates the brightnesses (bremsstrahlung, Dα, Hα) versus wavelength using plasma profile data from the C-Mod MDSplus database,2 a computation of the beam penetration, the viewing and DNB geometries, and bandpass filter characteristics. The model was first used to estimate signal levels and choose the optimal BES bandpass filters; its ultimate purpose is to determine the shot-to-shot tuning requirements of the filters for different discharge conditions. Comparisons of measured and predicted background bremsstrahlung and Dα brightnesses are presented, as are first measurements and calculations of the beam emission. The code is written in the IDL programming language3 utilizing the “widget” graphical user interface. Designed for geometrical and spectral flexibility, it can be modified to simulate other beam diagnostics such as motional-Stark-effect plasma current measurements and charge-exchange recombination spectroscopy, as well as passive diagnostics measuring chord-averaged spectral emission.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/rsi/article-pdf/72/1/987/11321634/987_1_online.pdf",""

Indexes of central command (heart rate, oxygen uptake, ratings of perceived exertion, and electromyographic activity), cardiac output, stroke volume, and total peripheral resistance were not significantly different between the four conditions. Mechanical stimulation during LBPP and combination conditions resulted in significant elevations in intramuscular pressure and mean arterial pressure from control at rest and throughout the incremental exercise protocol ( P < 0.05). Conversely, there existed no significant changes in mean arterial pressure when the metaboreflex was stimulated by cuff occlusion. These findings suggest that under normal conditions the mechanoreflex is tonically active and is the primary mediator of exercise pressor reflex-induced alterations in arterial blood pressure during submaximal dynamic exercise in humans.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jappl.2001.91.5.2351",""

In the lung, the impaired metabolism of surfactant phosphatidylcholine (PC) accompanies this acute and chronic injury. These effects are long-lived and extend beyond the time frame over which tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin-1β are elevated. In this paper, we demonstrate that in H441 lung cells these two processes, cytokine-induced metabolism of sphingomyelin and the inhibition of PC metabolism, are directly interrelated. First, metabolites of sphingomyelin hydrolysis themselves inhibit key enzymes necessary for restoring homeostasis between sphingomyelin and its metabolites. Ceramide stimulates sphingomyelinases as effectively as TNF-α, thereby amplifying the sphingomyelinase activation, and TNF-α, ceramide, and sphingosine all inhibit PC:ceramide phosphocholine transferase (sphingomyelin synthase), the enzyme that restores homeostasis between sphingomyelin and ceramide pools. Second, ceramide inhibits PC synthesis, probably because of its effects on CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, the rate-limiting enzymatic step in de novo PC synthesis. The data presented here suggest that TNF-α may be an inhibitor of phospholipid metabolism in inflammatory tissue injury. These actions may be amplified because of the ability of metabolites of sphingomyelin to inhibit the pathways that should restore the normal ceramide-sphingomyelin homeostasis.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajplung.2001.281.1.L98",""

Conventional treatment of XLH with oral phosphate and vitamin D is associated with increased urinary calcium excretion and nephrocalcinosis. Thiazide diuretics decrease urinary calcium excretion. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of thiazide diuretics on the clinical and radiologic course of nephrocalcinosis in children with XLH. Methods.: The effect of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) on clinical and radiologic progression of nephrocalcinosis was evaluated in 11 children with XLH. All patients had been treated previously with vitamin D and oral phosphate and had radiologic evidence of nephrocalcinosis. The average age of the patients at the start of HCTZ was 6.6 ± 1.0 years. The effect of oral HCTZ at 0.8 ± 0.1 mg/kg body weight per day given for 3.3 ± 0.6 years on the progression of nephrocalcinosis and urinary calcium excretion was evaluated. Results.: There was no change in serum phosphorous, calcium, potassium, and chloride after HCTZ therapy. HCTZ therapy increased serum bicarbonate and decreased urinary calcium excretion. The grade of nephrocalcinosis increased from 0.4 ± 0.2 to 1.5 ± 0.3 in the 2.3 ± 0.3 years before initiation of HCTZ therapy, whereas the degree of nephrocalcinosis was stable after 3.3 ± 0.6 years of HCTZ therapy (1.5 ± 0.3 vs 3.0 ± 0.3). Conclusion.: HCTZ decreased urinary calcium excretion but did not result in the resolution of nephrocalcinosis. However, when compared with the control period, HCTZ prevented the progression of nephrocalcinosis in children with XLH.","https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-pdf/108/1/e6/892457/e6.pdf",""

We examined vegetation features associated with nest patches of the Golden-cheeked Warbler (Dendroica chrysoparia), a federally endangered migrant songbird that breeds only in central Texas. We used a spatially paired design to measure 13 vegetation variables at 43 nests and at an equal number of randomly chosen nonuse patches, one located near each nest. Canopy closure was greater at nest patches than at nonuse patches. However, none of the other vegetation variables differed between a nest patch and its paired non-use patch on the same territory, despite high power to detect such differences. In contrast, 8 of the 13 variables exhibited significant variation among territories. For all 13 variables, effect size was substantially greater for variation between territories than for variation between nest patches and their paired nonuse patches. Lack of within-territory variation may reflect the scale at which vegetation varies in that habitat. Such a result suggests that territory selection may be more important than nest-patch selection in this species.","http://academic.oup.com/auk/article-pdf/118/4/1052/29685695/auk1052.pdf",""

All patients had follicular or small cell lymphocytic lymphoma after relapse from a prior response to conventional chemotherapy. Patients received a preparative regimen of fludarabine (25 mg/m2 given daily for 5 days or 30 mg/m2daily for 3 days) and intravenous cyclophosphamide (1 g/m2given daily for 2 days or 750 mg/m2 daily for 3 days). Nine patients received rituximab in addition to the chemotherapy. Tacrolimus and methotrexate were used for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Twenty patients were studied; their median age was 51 years. Twelve were in complete remission (CR) at transplantation. All patients achieved engraftment of donor cells. The median number of days with severe neutropenia was 6. Only 2 patients required more than one platelet transfusion. The cumulative incidence of acute grade II to IV GVHD was 20%. Only one patient developed acute GVHD of greater than grade II. All patients achieved CR. None have had a relapse of disease, with a median follow-up period of 21 months. The actuarial probability of being alive and in remission at 2 years was 84% (95% confidence interval, 57%-94%). Nonablative chemotherapy with fludarabine/cyclophosphamide followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a promising therapy for indolent lymphoma with minimal toxicity and myelosuppression. Further studies are warranted to compare nonablative allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation with alternative treatment strategies.","http://ashpublications.org/blood/article-pdf/98/13/3595/1678921/h8240103595.pdf",""

Conventional treatment of XLH with oral phosphate and vitamin D is associated with increased urinary calcium excretion and nephrocalcinosis. Thiazide diuretics decrease urinary calcium excretion. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of thiazide diuretics on the clinical and radiologic course of nephrocalcinosis in children with XLH. Methods.: The effect of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) on clinical and radiologic progression of nephrocalcinosis was evaluated in 11 children with XLH. All patients had been treated previously with vitamin D and oral phosphate and had radiologic evidence of nephrocalcinosis. The average age of the patients at the start of HCTZ was 6.6 ± 1.0 years. The effect of oral HCTZ at 0.8 ± 0.1 mg/kg body weight per day given for 3.3 ± 0.6 years on the progression of nephrocalcinosis and urinary calcium excretion was evaluated. Results.: There was no change in serum phosphorous, calcium, potassium, and chloride after HCTZ therapy. HCTZ therapy increased serum bicarbonate and decreased urinary calcium excretion. The grade of nephrocalcinosis increased from 0.4 ± 0.2 to 1.5 ± 0.3 in the 2.3 ± 0.3 years before initiation of HCTZ therapy, whereas the degree of nephrocalcinosis was stable after 3.3 ± 0.6 years of HCTZ therapy (1.5 ± 0.3 vs 3.0 ± 0.3). Conclusion.: HCTZ decreased urinary calcium excretion but did not result in the resolution of nephrocalcinosis. However, when compared with the control period, HCTZ prevented the progression of nephrocalcinosis in children with XLH.","https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-pdf/108/1/e6/892457/e6.pdf",""

To accelerate its current genome research, we developed a whole-genome, BAC/BIBAC-based, integrated physical, genetic, and sequence map of the A. thaliana ecotype Columbia. This new map was constructed from the clones of a new plant-transformation-competent BIBAC library and is integrated with the existing sequence map. The clones were restriction fingerprinted by DNA sequencing gel-based electrophoresis, assembled into contigs, and anchored to an existing genetic map. The map consists of 194 BAC/BIBAC contigs, spanning 126 Mb of the 130-Mb Arabidopsis genome. A total of 120 contigs, spanning 114 Mb, were anchored to the chromosomes of Arabidopsis. Accuracy of the integrated map was verified using the existing physical and sequence maps and numerous DNA markers. Integration of the new map with the sequence map has enabled gap closure of the sequence map and will facilitate functional analysis of the genome sequence. The method used here has been demonstrated to be sufficient for whole-genome physical mapping from large-insert random bacterial clones and thus is applicable to rapid development of whole-genome physical maps for other species.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/159/3/1231/42035187/genetics1231.pdf",""

Under basal conditions in HeLa and Hep2 cells, a portion of nuclear PA28 is concentrated at promyelocytic leukemia oncoprotein (PML)-containing bodies also commonly known as PODs or ND10. IFNγ treatment greatly increased the number and size of the PA28- and PML-containing bodies, and the effect was further enhanced in serum- deprived cells. PML bodies are disrupted in response to certain viral infections and in diseases such as acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Like PML, PA28 was delocalized from PML bodies by expression of the cytomegalovirus protein, IE1, and in NB4 cells, an APL model line. Moreover, retinoic acid treatment, which causes remission of APL in patients and reformation of PML- containing bodies in NB4 cells, relocalized PA28 to this site. In contrast, the proteasome, the functional target of PA28, was not detected at PML bodies under basal conditions in HeLa and Hep2 cells, but IFNγ promoted accumulation of ‘immunoproteasomes’ at this site. These results establish PA28 as a novel component of nuclear PML bodies, and suggest that PA28 may assemble or activate immunoproteasomes at this site as part of its role in proteasome-dependent MHC class I antigen presentation.","https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article-pdf/114/1/29/3354269/joces_114_1_29.pdf",""

Other areas in which the III nitrides could be especially beneficial are in high-energy particle detectors and in narrow-band optical sensors for the UV/visible spectral range. In addition to the inherent thermal, mechanical, and chemical stability of III nitrides, such devices would benefit from the larger band gap, higher breakdown, and insulating properties of GaN and related alloys. The surface quality of nitride materials is generally good, and this is very important for fabrication of optical devices. The specific characteristics of the III-nitride layers can be achieved by appropriate substrate selection and precise control over the material growth process. In this article, results on radio-frequency molecular-beam-epitaxy growth of GaN, AlN, AlGaN, and InGaN layers on sapphire and silicon substrates for optoelectronic sensor development applications are presented.

Currently, several primate lentivirus-based gene transfer systems, such as those based on human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV/SIV), are being tested; however, their use in humans raises safety concerns, such as the generation of replication-competent viruses through recombination with related endogenous retroviruses or retrovirus-like elements. Due to the greater phylogenetic distance from primate lentiviruses, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is becoming the lentivirus of choice for human gene transfer systems. However, the safety of FIV-based vector systems has not been tested experimentally. Since lentiviruses such as HIV-1 and SIV have been shown to cross-package their RNA genomes, we tested the ability of FIV RNA to get cross-packaged into primate lentivirus particles such as HIV-1 and SIV, as well as a nonlentiviral retrovirus such as Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV), and vice versa. Our results reveal that FIV RNA can be cross-packaged by primate lentivirus particles such as HIV-1 and SIV and vice versa; however, a nonlentivirus particle such as MPMV is unable to package FIV RNA. Interestingly, FIV particles can package MPMV RNA but cannot propagate the vector RNA further for other steps of the retrovirus life cycle. These findings reveal that diverse retroviruses are functionally more similar than originally thought and suggest that upon coinfection of the same host, cross- or copackaging may allow distinct retroviruses to generate chimeric variants with unknown pathogenic potential.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.75.11.5129-5140.2001",""

The algorithm yields solutions for pressure at a multitude of times with the same efficiency of that of a single-time solution. Extensive comparisons with analytical solutions show that our simulator yields pressure results with accuracies better than 1%, and favorably competes with commercial simulators in CPU execution times and memory efficiency.

These agents act preferentially on plasminogen by converting it to the active molecule plasmin. This initiates the clot lysis process, which may take several days for completion. Most patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have PTFE grafts for chronic hemodialysis. When these grafts are thrombosed, they are either surgically revised or percutaneously thrombolysed. When these measures fail another access is created without removing the clotted graft. However, it is possible that de-clotting of these thrombosed PTFE grafts can occur spontaneously. Once the graft develops an endothelial lining, these cells can contribute to the fibrinolytic process by secreting tPA or pro-UK. Because this endothelial lining may be less developed than that of a normal vessel, the fibrinolytic process may occur at a slower rate or not at all. Frequent cannulation during hemodialysis can denude existing endothelium, further contributing to the inadequacy of the graft to initiate thrombolysis. In practice, once the PTFE is clotted, the graft is ignored if it is not considered for declotting. In such circumstances the re-canalization process could be overlooked, resulting in the unnecessary placement of additional accesses. Presented here are three patients with clotted grafts in which re-canalization occurred without intervention.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/112972980100200306",""

The governing energy equation is formulated based on the two-equation model and the non-Fourier model. This formulation leads to the emergence of four thermal parameters: lag-time in heat flux τq, lag-time τt in temperature due to interstitial heat transfer coefficient h, and lag-time in the transient response of the temperature gradient τx in the heat flux equation. These parameters account for the microstructural thermal interaction between the fluid and neighboring solid matrix as well as the delay time needed for both phases to approach thermal equilibrium. An experimental verification of the microscale model was performed under standard laboratory conditions. The values of the aforementioned thermal parameters were determined to compute the fluid and solid temperatures. Results predicted from three models (classical Fourier, non-Fourier, and experimental) were compared. It indicates an excellent agreement between the non-Fourier and the experimental model, and a significant deviation of Fourier prediction from the experimental results.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2001/HTD-24279/6794835/373_1_imece2001-htd-24279.pdf",""

The quantitative, temporal relationship between ABP and HR was fitted by a second-order autoregressive (AR) model. The frequency response was evaluated by transfer function analysis. Results: HR changes during acute hypotension appear to be controlled by an ABP error signal between baseline and induced hypotension. The quantitative relationship between changes in ABP and HR is characterized by a second-order AR model with a pure time delay of 0.75 s containing low-pass filter properties. During LBNP, the change in HR/change in ABP during induced hypotension significantly decreased, as did the numerator coefficients of the AR model and transfer function gain. Conclusions: 1) Beat-to-beat HR responses to dynamic changes in ABP may be controlled by an error signal rather than directional changes in pressure, suggesting a “set point” mechanism in short-term ABP control. 2) The quantitative relationship between dynamic changes in ABP and HR can be described by a second-order AR model with a pure time delay. 3) The ability of the baroreflex to evoke a HR response to transient changes in pressure was reduced during LBNP, which was due primarily to a reduction of the static gain of the baroreflex.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpheart.2001.280.1.H407",""

Despite multiple surgical and endoscopic procedures to treat the venous malformations, the patient continued to bleed primarily from lesions in the small bowel. Therefore, this patient was treated with octreotide, a somatostatin analog known to decrease splanchnic blood flow and that is used for acute and chronic gastrointestinal bleeding. Methods: Octreotide therapy, 5.7 μg/kg subcutaneously twice daily, was initiated, and the patient was followed up clinically. Complete blood counts, blood glucose concentration, pancreatic enzyme concentration, liver function tests, and growth hormone concentration were monitored during treatments. Results: During the 4 weeks after initiation of octreotide therapy, hemoglobin concentration was maintained without the need for transfusions. Octreotide decreased the patient's monthly need for blood transfusion from 52 ± 7 mL · kg Conclusion: Octreotide decreased the patient's need for blood transfusions.

We found that increased levels of wild-type eIF2, in the presence of sufficient levels of initiator tRNA, overcome the requirement for eIF2B in vivo. Consistent with bypassing eIF2B, these conditions also suppress the lethal effect of overexpressing the mammalian tumor suppressor PKR, an eIF2α kinase. The effects described are further enhanced in the presence of a mutation in the G protein (γ) subunit of eIF2, gcd11-K250R, which mimics the function of eIF2B in vitro. Interestingly, the same conditions that bypass eIF2B also overcome the requirement for the normally essential eIF2α structural gene (SUI2). Our results suggest that the eIF2βγ complex is capable of carrying out the essential function(s) of eIF2 in the absence of eIF2α and eIF2B and are consistent with the idea that the latter function primarily to regulate the level of eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAiMet ternary complexes in vivo.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/158/1/123/42031215/genetics0123.pdf",""

The calculations are performed using complete active space (CAS) choices that are usually excellent for MCSTEP ionization potential (IP) calculations and also for CAS choices that are inadequate for MCSTEP IP calculations.

These values were later revised in a 1998 FHWA report. The minimum values were developed as part of a process to add end-of-service life retroreflectivity values to the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. There have been few or no comparisons between the use of minimum retroreflectivity values to define end-of-service life and the results of typical nighttime visual inspections. Researchers at the Texas Transportation Institute conducted such an evaluation as part of a Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) sign workshop. In the evaluation, TxDOT sign crews evaluated 49 signs on an 8-km (5-mi) closed course. Each sign was rated as “acceptable,” “marginal,” or “unacceptable.” Vehicle headlamp illuminance was also measured. The results of the evaluations were compared with the application of the FHWA minimum values. The results show that whereas one sign did not meet the low-speed FHWA minimum values, the average ratings for the TxDOT sign crews indicated that 26 signs were not acceptable. The researchers identified several factors that affected the average sign ratings. These factors included the uniformity of the sign face, the type of sheeting material, and the retroreflectivity. The findings indicate that among the TxDOT sign crews participating in the evaluation, visual nighttime inspections result in a higher failing rate than does the application of the FHWA research recommendations for minimum levels of retroreflectivity. This finding indicates that visual sign inspections should be an important component of assessing the nighttime visibility of traffic signs.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/1754-02",""

The traditional endpoint detection technique uses a few manually selected wavelengths, which are adequate for large open areas. As the integrated circuit devices continue to shrink in geometry and increase in device density, detecting the endpoint for small open areas presents a serious challenge to process engineers. In this work, a high-resolution optical emission spectroscopy (OES) system is used to provide the necessary sensitivity for detecting subtle endpoint signals. Principal component analysis is used to analyze the OES data and extract key components that capture the endpoint signal. Data analysis from many wafers shows that the endpoint pattern in the principal components is repeatable. Two methods are used to select wavelengths so as to improve reliability and reduce susceptibility to noise. The first method is to remove those spectrum windows that contain no endpoint information. The second method is to use a “sphere” criterion to select the most relevant wavelengths. The final endpoint algorithm using a much-reduced number of wavelengths shows more distinguishable and reliable endpoint features.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jva/article-pdf/19/1/66/8185812/66_1_online.pdf",""

The goal was to map the effects of the same tone after blocking or eliciting a conditioned emotional response (CER). In the tone-blocked group, previous learning about a light blocked a CER to the tone. In the tone-excitor group, the same pairings of tone with shock US resulted in a CER to the tone in the absence of previous learning about the light. A third group showed no CER after pseudorandom presentations of these stimuli. Brain systems involved in the various associative effects of Pavlovian conditioning were identified, and their functional significance was interpreted in light of previous FDG studies. Three conditioning effects were mapped: 1) blocking effects: FDG uptake was lower in medial prefrontal cortex and higher in spinal trigeminal and cuneate nuclei in the tone-blocked group relative to the tone-excitor group. 2) Contiguity effects: relative to pseudorandom controls, similar FDG uptake increases in the tone-blocked and -excitor groups were found in auditory regions (inferior colliculus and cortex), hippocampus (CA1), cerebellum, caudate putamen, and solitary nucleus. Contiguity effects may be due to tone-shock pairings common to the tone-blocked and -excitor groups rather than their different CER. And 3) excitatory effects: FDG uptake increases limited to the tone-excitor group occurred in a circuit linked to the CER, including insular and anterior cingulate cortex, vertical diagonal band nucleus, anterior hypothalamus, and caudoventral caudate putamen. This study provided the first large-scale map of brain regions underlying the Kamin blocking effect on conditioning. In particular, the results suggest that suppression of prefrontal activity and activation of unconditioned stimulus pathways are important neural substrates of the Kamin blocking effect.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jn.2001.86.2.809",""

Here we examined whether other neurotrophic factors affect MTAL HCO[Formula: see text] absorption. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor had no effect. In contrast, neurotrophin-3 (NT-3, 0.7 nM) inhibited HCO[Formula: see text] absorption by 40% (half-maximal inhibition at ∼0.4 nM). Inhibition by NT-3 was additive to inhibition by NGF. Inhibitors of ERK activation that block inhibition by NGF had no effect on inhibition by NT-3. In contrast, 8-bromo-cAMP or forskolin pretreatment blocked inhibition by NT-3 but not NGF. Inhibition by NT-3 was also blocked by the specific protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor myristoylated PKI(14–22) amide and by vasopressin, which inhibits HCO[Formula: see text]absorption via cAMP. Inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or protein kinase C did not affect NT-3-induced inhibition, but inhibition by NT-3 was eliminated by genistein, consistent with involvement of a receptor tyrosine kinase. These results demonstrate that NT-3 inhibits HCO[Formula: see text] absorption via a cAMP- and PKA-dependent pathway. NT-3 and NGF regulate MTAL ion transport through different signal transduction mechanisms. These studies establish a direct role for NT-3 in regulation of renal tubule transport and identify the MTAL as an important target for neurotrophins, which may be involved in the control of renal acid excretion.","https://journals.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpcell.2001.281.6.C1804",""

We investigated the genetic involvement of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (PkaA), a potential downstream target of FadA activity, in ST production and conidiation. Relative to wild type, sporulation was decreased in the pkaA overexpression strain but was not totally absent, as occurs in ΔflbA or fadAG42R (fadA-dominant active) strains. Deletion of pkaA resulted in a hyper-conidiating strain with limited radial growth. This phenotype was epistatic to mutation in flbA or fadA; the double mutants ΔpkaA; ΔflbA and ΔpkaA; fadAG42R recovered sporulation and their radial growth was severely restricted. PkaA overexpression also negatively regulated AflR, the ST biosynthesis-specific transcription factor, both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally. Deletion of pkaA restored ST production in the ΔflbA background but not in the fadAG42R background. These data provide genetic evidence that the FlbA/FadA signaling pathway regulating ST production and morphological development is partially mediated through PkaA.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/157/2/591/42032198/genetics0591.pdf",""

At 1 min after exercise, MAP decreased less ( P < 0.05) during inactive recovery in men (−18 ± 2 mmHg) compared with women (−30 ± 2 mmHg). This difference was due to greater decreases in SV and less increase in TPR during inactive recovery from exercise in women compared with men. These differences persisted for 5 min after exercise.

In a one dimensional scattering problem, the fourth order error coefficients of these new algorithms are roughly 500 times smaller than fourth order algorithms with negative coefficient, such as those based on the traditional Forest–Ruth symplectic integrator. These algorithms can produce converged results of conventional second or fourth order algorithms using time steps 5 to 10 times as large. Iterating these positive coefficient algorithms to sixth order also produced better converged algorithms than iterating the Forest–Ruth algorithm to sixth order or using Yoshida’s sixth order algorithm A directly.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/114/17/7338/10831663/7338_1_online.pdf",""

The devices were tested on two-lane low-volume, high-speed rural roads where maintenance activities were completed in a single day. Speed and volume data were collected for cars and trucks as they traveled through four work zones. These data were collected when no work-zone traffic control was present, when normal work-zone traffic control was set up, and when the test treatment was installed. The results for the portable rumble strips were mixed, with passenger cars experiencing less than a 3.2-km/h (2-mph) reduction in mean speed approaching the temporary traffic-control zone. The impact of the rumble strips on trucks was more pronounced, with mean speed reductions approaching the temporary traffic-control zone of up to 11.6 km/h (7.2 mph) lower than normal traffic control. The percent of vehicles exceeding the speed limit in the advance warning area was also reduced when the rumble strips were used. The speed display was generally more effective than the rumble strips at reducing speeds in the advance warning area. Mean speeds were often reduced approaching the activity area, with speed reductions of up to 16.1 km/h (10 mph) being achieved.

They are described as serrated interfaces between carbonate rock units and are composed of their insoluble residues. Samples of stylolites and adjacent host rock were examined using x-ray diffraction and analytical electron microscopy. The results revealed a very close relationship between the stylolite and its host rock. Stylolites are the markers indicating that considerable thicknesses of strata may have been dissolved away during diagenesis of the carbonate. The extent (thickness) of stylolite seams may affect the porosity and permeability of a carbonate formation. Presence of fine platelets of micas and sulfur along with the organic matter in stylolites can make them impermeable to fluid flow and seal petroleum reservoirs. The comparative study of the mineralogy of the stylolites and the acid-residues of their immediate host rocks directly points to the origin of these stylolite seams in these dolostones. The stylolites analyzed consist mainly of quartz, feldspars, pyrite, mica, native sulfur, and organic material. All these minerals were found to be the impurities in the enclosing host carbonate. It was estimated that about 100 mm of the host dolomite column must have been dissolved to generate a stylolite with a thickness of about 1.0 mm.","http://onepetro.org/OTCONF/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.4043/13229-MS/1893383/otc-13229-ms.pdf",""

Porosity, permeability, and saturation values have no intrinsic spatial information and must be linked to a 3-D geologic model to be distributed in space. This link is provided by relating petrophysical properties to rock fabrics. The vertical succession of rock fabrics was shown to be useful in constructing a geologic framework for distributing porosity, permeability, and saturation in 3-D. Permeability is perhaps the most difficult petrophysical property to obtain and image because its calculation from wireline logs requires the estimation of pore-size distribution. In this study of the Arab-D reservoir, rock fabric and interparticle porosity were used to estimate pore-size distribution. Cross-plots of water saturation and porosity, calibrated with rock-fabric descriptions, formed the basis for determining the distribution of rock fabric and pore size from resistivity and porosity logs. Interparticle porosity was obtained from travel-time/porosity, cross-plot relationships. A global porosity-permeability transform that related rock fabric, interparticle porosity, and permeability was the basis for calculating permeability from wireline logs. Calculated permeability values compared well with core permeability. In uncored wells, permeability was summed vertically and the horizontal permeability profile compared with flow-meter data.

Activation of the insulin receptor initiates signaling through both the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and the mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK, also referred to as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2)] pathways. Acute exercise has no effect on the PI3-kinase pathway signaling elements but does activate the MAPK pathway, which may play a role in the adaptation of muscle to exercise. It is unknown whether training produces a chronic effect on basal activity or insulin response of the MAPK pathway. The present study was undertaken to determine whether exercise training improves the activity of the MAPK pathway or its response to insulin in obese Zucker rats, a well-characterized model of insulin resistance. To accomplish this, obese Zucker rats were studied by using the hindlimb perfusion method with or without 7 wk of treadmill training. Activation of the MAPK pathway was determined in gastrocnemius muscles exposed in situ to insulin. Compared with lean Zucker rats, untrained obese Zucker rats had reduced basal and insulin-stimulated activities of ERK2 and its downstream target p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK2). Seven weeks of training significantly increased basal and insulin-stimulated ERK2 and RSK2 activities, as well as insulin stimulation of MAPK kinase activity. This effect was maintained for at least 96 h in the case of ERK2. The training-induced increase in basal ERK2 activity was correlated with the increase in citrate synthase activity. Therefore, 7 wk of training increases basal and insulin-stimulated ERK2 activity. The increase in basal ERK2 activity may be related to the response of muscle to training.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jappl.2001.90.2.454",""

The purpose of this paper is to describe the methodology and experimental techniques used in determining whether one or both axles failed prior to the accident, and thus contributing to the accident, or whether both axles failed as a result of the rollover and the ensuing impact with the highway. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) technique was used to obtain detailed characteristics of the fracture surface on both axles. Through-thickness hardness profile of the axles was determined using incremental micro-hardness measurements in order to assess the depth of case hardening in both axles. Impact, tensile and fatigue specimens were machined from the remaining parts of the failed axles and were tested to destruction using standard impact (Izod), tensile and fatigue tests. The fracture surface characteristics of the test specimens were compared to those of the failed axles in order to isolate the mode of failure. Based on the results of the above tests, the history of the repair work performed on the rear wheel bearings and the physical evidence of various marks and damages remaining on the vehicle’s body, it was determined that one of the rear axles failed prior to the rollover, while the other occurred as a result of the rollover and ensuing impact with the highway.","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2001/DE-23299/6797496/137_1_imece2001-de-23299.pdf",""

Very high levels of turbulence were generated by the mainstream interaction with the coolant jets. Furthermore, this turbulence was highly anisotropic, with the spanwise component of the turbulent fluctuations being twice as large as the other components.

In a previous study, 13 patients with CVCs had no radiographic evidence of DVT. However, recent abstracts and case studies demonstrate that DVT does occur. Therefore, this study sought to determine the frequency of DVT in children with hemophilia and long-term CVCs and to correlate venographic findings with clinical features. All hemophilia patients with tunneled subclavian CVCs in place for 12 months or more were candidates for evaluation. Patients were examined for physical signs of DVT and questioned about catheter dysfunction. Contrast venograms were obtained to identify DVT. Fifteen boys with severe hemophilia were evaluated, including 9 from the initially studied group of 13. Eight patients had evidence of DVT, 5 of whom previously had normal venograms. Five of 15 patients had clinical problems related to the CVC, all of whom had DVT. Four of 15 patients had suggestive physical signs; 3 had DVT. The mean duration of catheter placement for all patients was 57.5 months (range, 12-102 months). For patients with DVT, the mean duration was 66.6 ± 7.5 months, compared to 49.5 ± 7.2 months for patients without DVT (P = .06). No patient whose CVC was in place fewer than 48 months had an abnormal venogram.

Scanning electron microscope with polarization analysis (SEMPA) is one of the most powerful tools to investigate the surface magnetic domain structure of magnetic materials. On the other hand, at energies high enough to generate a two-hole final state arising from Auger transitions, it is possible to observe the spin polarization of the Auger electrons. These electrons reveal element-specific local magnetic information, particularly valuable for surface magnetic studies with composite systems. By using the uniqueness of the UTA-SEMPA tool, one can obtain the magnetic domain picture and also perform spin-polarized Auger electron spectroscopy studies by probing a single domain at the surface.

Such designs must have applicability to a large class of machines, require installation of no additional sensors, and require minimal detailed information regarding the specific machine design. Electromechanical systems, such as electric motors driving dynamic loads like pumps and compressors, often develop incipient failures that result in downtime. There is a large number of such failure modes, with a large majority being of mechanical nature. The precise signatures of these failure modes depend on numerous machine-specific factors, including variations in the electric power supply and driven load. In this paper the development and experimental demonstration of a sensorless, detection and diagnosis system is presented for incipient machine faults. The developed fault detection and diagnosis system uses recent developments in dynamic recurrent neural networks in implementing an empirical model-based approach, and multi-resolution signal processing for extracting fault information from transient signals. The signals used by the system are only the multi-phase motor current and voltage sensors, whereas the transient mechanical speed is estimated from these measurements using a recently developed speed filter. The effectiveness of the fault diagnosis system is demonstrated by detecting stator, rotor and bearing failures at early stages of development and during different levels of deterioration. Experimental test results from small machines, 2.2 kW, and large machines, 373 kW and 597 kW, are presented demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Furthermore, the ability of the diagnosis system to discriminate between false alarms and actual incipient failure conditions is demonstrated.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/DETC2001/VIB-21750/6592635/3127_1.pdf",""

Previous results suggest that judgments about collision are influenced by scene parameters, task constraints, and age. Such studies typically focussed on judgments about when a collision would occur (time to contact). Results indicated that older observers underestimated time to contact more than younger observers; they thought that collisions would occur relatively sooner (Hancock & Manser, 1997; Schiff et al., 1992). However, biases toward underestimation would decrease the risk for accidents (Scialfa et al., 1987). Therefore, the age difference in judgments about time to contact does not seem to be a good candidate to account for the higher accident rate in older drivers. Alternatively, age differences in judgments about whether a collision would occur (potential collision; DeLucia, 1995) may contribute to differential accident rates. Therefore, age differences in such judgments were measured with computer simulations of three-dimensional scenes. When participants reported whether two moving objects would collide with each other, older adults (51-76 years) responded less accurately and more quickly than younger adults (18-23 years). When participants reported whether an approaching object would hit them, mean thresholds were greater for older females compared with younger females. The results indicate that the ability to detect collisions is an important factor to consider in an account of age differences in accident rates. Further research is warranted to determine whether less effective judgments about whether a collision would occur contribute more to the higher rate of traffic accidents and convictions in older drivers than to (mis)estimates of when a collision would occur.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/154193120104501821",""

The purposes of this prospective, multiparametric flow cytometry study were to quantify hematogones across age groups and a spectrum of clinical conditions, to identify factors that affect the relative quantity of hematogones, and to compare their immunophenotype with that of neoplastic lymphoblasts. A total of 662 consecutive marrow specimens were analyzed for hematogones using one of two 4-color antibody combinations; hematogones were identified in 528 (79.8%). There was a significant decline in hematogones with increasing age (P &lt; .001), but a broad range was found at all ages and many adults had a relatively high number. Specimens processed by density gradient had a higher mean percent hematogones than those processed by erythrocyte lysis (P &lt; .001). There was a direct decline in hematogones with increasing marrow involvement with neoplastic cells. A total of 8% of the 662 specimens contained 5% or more hematogones: 24.6% of specimens from patients aged less than 16 years and 6.3% from those 16 and older (P &lt; .000 01). Increased hematogones were observed most often in patients with lymphoma, marrow regenerative states, immune cytopenias, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Hematogones always exhibited a typical complex spectrum of antigen expression that defines the normal antigenic evolution of B-cell precursors and lacked aberrant expression. In contrast, lymphoblasts in 49 cases of precursor B-ALL showed maturation arrest and exhibited 1 to 11 immunophenotypic aberrancies. Four-color flow cytometry with optimal combinations of antibodies consistently distinguishes between hematogones and neoplastic lymphoblasts.","http://ashpublications.org/blood/article-pdf/98/8/2498/1677838/h8200102498.pdf",""
