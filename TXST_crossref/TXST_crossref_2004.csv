There are 24 described Xiphophorus species and a greater number of pedigreed strains; thus, the number of potential interspecies hybrid cross combinations is quite large. Previously, select Xiphophorus experimental crosses have been shown to exhibit differing characteristics between parental species and among the hybrid fishes derived from crossing them, such as widely differing susceptibilities to chemical or physical agents. For instance, genomic regions harboring tumor suppressor and oncogenes have been identified via linkage association of these loci with a small set of established genetic markers. The power of this experimental strategy is related to the number of genetic markers available in the Xiphophorus interspecies cross of interest. Thus, we have undertaken the task of expanding the suite of easily scored markers by characterization of Xiphophorus microsatellite sequences. Using a cross between Xiphophorus maculatus and X. andersi, we report a linkage map predominantly composed of microsatellite markers. All 24 acrocentric chromosome sets of Xiphophorus are represented in the assembled linkage map with an average intergenomic distance of 7.5 cM. Since both male and female F1 hybrids were used to produce backcross progeny, these recombination rates were compared between “male” and “female” maps. Although several genomic regions exhibit differences in map length, male- and female-derived maps are similar. Thus Xiphophorus, in contrast to zebrafish, Danio rerio, and several other vertebrate species, does not show sex-specific differences in recombination. The microsatellite markers we report can be easily adapted to any Xiphophorus interspecies and some intraspecies crosses, and thus provide a means to directly compare results derived from independent experiments.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/168/1/363/42216043/genetics0363.pdf",""

Previous research suggests that, in contrast to results from the commercial domain, these writing styles do not influence memory of distance education materials. This discrepancy is possibly due to measurement differences. To address this issue, the present study employed recognition (i.e., multiple-choice) and guided recall (i.e., fill-in-the-blank) tasks in order to assess the efficacy of the writing styles in a distance education context.

We believe that treatment outcome (survival) is inversely related to tumor ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) levels. To prove this, we needed to develop an assay to quantify ODC levels in formalin-fixed tumor tissues, which would enable a retrospective study of tumor biopsy specimens from the landmark clinical trial. We developed an assay using a specific polyclonal antibody coupled to an Alexa fluorescent dye. Transgenic MHC-ODC mice with differing levels of ODC in heart muscle were used to establish the relationship between mean gray-scale intensity and enzymatic ODC activity. We found a direct relationship between mean gray-scale intensity of the ODC antibody coupled to Alexa 647 dye and enzymatic activity. Preliminary analysis of a human glioma tissue array shows that tumor-specific variations in levels of ODC can be semiquantitated. We show that mean gray-scale intensity of astrocytoma:glioblastoma is 1:6 and of anaplastic astrocytoma:glioblastoma is 1:4. We also compared the intensity of antibody to Ki67 coupled with phyco-erythrin simultaneously in cells but failed to see a relationship that crossed histologies. We conclude that we can measure levels of ODC in formalin-fixed tumor tissue using an antibody to ODC coupled to Alexa 647 dye, and this will enable us to conduct a future study to correlate survival of patients with gliomas of different histologies treated with DFMO to tumor ODC levels.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1369/jhc.4A6358.2004",""

Fractal geometry provides an effective way to describe the complex property of geographical features. This paper uses a modified box-counting method to describe the fractal property of urban transportation networks. Assuming that human settlements of different sizes are all operated by the same growth procedure, this paper investigates the relationship between the mass size of cities and the complexity of their road systems. The results confirm that, as cities grow from small to large, their transportation networks generally become more complicated—the urban spaces are filled up more densely by city roads and the locations within a city are more accessible. The quantitative relationship identified between the complexity of urban transportation network and city size provides an empirical guide for the planning and policymaking of urban development and road construction.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1068/b3163",""

Coated to the working surfaces of the bearings was a 900nm thick uniform tungsten hydrocarbon (W-C:H) coating using an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) assisted, hybrid chemical vapor deposition (CVD)/physical vapor deposition (PVD) tool. Tribological characteristics and mechanical properties of as-electrodeposited Ni micro bearings, annealed Ni micro bearings at 800°C, and W-C:H coated micro bearings were investigated. Potential applications of the micro bearings may involve very light contact pressure (5∼30MPa) and high sliding speed, such as micro motors and micro turbines. Conventional pin-on disc test methods on top flat surfaces, (001) planes, cannot effectively predict tribological characteristics because these micro bearings use the sidewall (110 plane) as a working surface. A special micro wear tester and friction tester were developed. Surface morphologies of new and worn bearing surfaces were studied using SEM. Raman Spectroscopy and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) characterized the W-C:H coated micro bearings. Test results of the W-C:H coated micro bearings (wear characteristics and friction) are also presented. W-C:H coated micro bearings had much lower wear rate than uncoated bearings. During the wear test, a transfer layer formed on the counter steel shaft even under very small contact pressure, leading to low steady state friction and high wear resistance.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IJTC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/TRIB2004-64156/2611594/249_1.pdf",""

In filling this gap, we criticize and build on environmental and political sociology. We make the case and provide evidence that the U.S. military pursues a pattern of environmental “bads” that cannot be reduced to capitalism and that coercive state policies can mold the spatial distribution of people relative to environmental dangers. Our contribution, then, is both theoretical and substantive. First, we recast the environmental sociology literature by specifying the scope conditions under which a “treadmill of production” and a “treadmill of destruction” are applicable. Specifically, we argue that a “treadmill of destruction” is driven by a distinct logic of geopolitics that cannot be reduced to capitalism. Second, we provide empirical evidence of the “treadmill of destruction” by examining the environmental inequality endured by Native Americans at the hands of the U.S. military. We have collected data on a large number of military bases that have been closed but remain dangerous due to unexploded ordnance. We provide evidence that Native American lands tend to be located in the same county as such hazardous sites. In the twentieth century, the United States fought and won two global wars and prevailed in a sustained Cold War. The geopolitical demands of remaining the world's leading military power pushed the United States to produce, test, and deploy weapons of unprecedented toxicity. Native Americans have been left exposed to the dangers of this toxic legacy.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/000312240406900405",""

Data were acquired over the range from 20–110 eV, and this wide spectral coverage highlighted that alternative vibrational modes exhibit contrasting behavior, even over a range usually considered to be dominated by atomic effects. Alternative vibrational modes exhibit qualitatively distinct energy dependences, and this contrasting mode-specific behavior underscores the point that vibrationally resolved measurements reflect the sensitivity of the electron scattering dynamics to well-defined changes in molecular geometry. In particular, such energy-dependent studies help to elucidate the mechanism(s) responsible for populating the symmetry forbidden vibrational levels [i.e., v+=(010), (001), (030), and (110)]. This is the first study in which vibrationally resolved data have been acquired as a function of energy for all of the vibrational modes of a polyatomic system. Theoretical Schwinger variational calculations are used to interpret the experimental data, and they indicate that a 4σg→kσu shape resonance is responsible for most of the excursions observed for the vibrational branching ratios. Generally, the energy dependent trends are reproduced well by theory, but a notable exception is the symmetric stretch vibrational branching ratio. The calculated results display a strong peak in the vibrational branching ratio while the experimental data show a pronounced minimum. This suggests an interference mechanism that is not accounted for in the single-channel adiabatic-nuclei calculations. Electronic branching ratios were also measured and compared to the vibrational branching ratios to assess the relative contributions of interchannel (i.e., Herzberg–Teller) versus intrachannel (i.e., photoelectron-mediated) coupling.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/120/2/612/19288230/612_1_online.pdf",""

We present a straight‐forward technique for their joint inversion which hinges on treating surface waves as horizontally‐propagating rays with deep sensitivity kernels. This formulation allows surface wave phase or group measurements to be integrated directly into existing body wave tomography inversions with modest effort. We apply the joint inversion to a synthetic case and to data from the RISTRA project in the southwest U.S. The data variance reductions demonstrate that the joint inversion produces a better fit to the combined dataset, not merely a compromise. For large arrays, this method offers an improvement over augmenting body wave tomography with a one‐dimensional model. The joint inversion combines the absolute velocity of a surface wave model with the high resolution afforded by body waves—both qualities that are required to understand regional‐scale mantle phenomena.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2004GL020373",""

In this paper, we focus our analysis on a directed sample of firms for which reported earnings are highly distorted by changes in R&D spending, and rely on intraday trading data and event study tests of both stock returns and trading activity (at the time of quarterly earnings announcements) to examine whether the stock market is fixated on reported earnings or whether it attempts to “look beyond” reported earnings by utilizing the information on R&D spending disclosed as part of the earnings announcement. The results suggest that R&D spending information has an effect on trading activity for all trade sizes and firm information environments, but no price effect for firms with relatively impoverished information environments.

The intrinsic reaction coordinate potential energy curve, reaction energetics, and transition state (TS) properties were calculated for this reaction at different levels of electronic structure theory, and MP2/6-31G* was chosen as a meaningful and practical method for performing the direct dynamics. The trajectories show that the HF bond, uncoupled from the other degrees of freedom, is formed within the first 10 fs as the system moves from the TS towards products. The populations of the HF vibration states, determined from the simulations, decrease monotonically as found from experiments. However, the simulation’s populations for the low and high energy vibration states are larger and smaller, respectively, than the experimental results. The HF rotational temperature found from the simulations is in agreement with experiment. Increasing the TS’s excess energy gives higher rotational temperatures for both C2H4 and HF. Energy is partitioned to the products from both the excess energy in the TS and the potential energy release in the exit channel. Partitioning from these two energy sources is distinguished by varying the TS’s excess energy. An analysis of the simulation’s energy disposal shows that the fractions of the excess energy partitioned to relative translation, C2H4 vibration, C2H4 rotation, HF vibration, and HF rotation, are 0.17, 0.64, 0.076, 0.067, and 0.046, respectively, and are in good agreement with previous simulations on empirical potentials and experiments. The partitioning found for the potential energy release is 81%, &lt;0.05%, 5%, 11%, and 3% to relative translation, C2H4 vibration, C2H4 rotation, HF vibration, and HF rotation. This result is substantially different than the deduction from experiments, which summarizes the partitioning as 20%, 45%, 24%, and &lt;12% to relative translation, C2H4 vibration+rotation, HF vibration, and HF rotation. Possible origins of the difference between the simulations and experiments in the release of the potential energy is discussed.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/121/18/8831/19246643/8831_1_online.pdf",""

We demonstrate that Hu1D10 induces caspase-independent apoptosis following secondary cross-linking in primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and signal transduction, as evidenced by phosphorylation of Syk and AKT, were noted. The source of the Hu1D10-induced ROS was examined using the Raji lymphoblastic cell line with engineered defects in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Hu1D10 treatment of clones with deficient mitochondrial respiration produced ROS suggesting a cytoplasmic source. Administration of ROS scavengers to primary CLL cells prior to Hu1D10 treatment diminished AKT activation. Treatment with Hu1D10 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 demonstrated in vitro synergy with enhanced apoptosis. In conjunction with an ongoing clinical trial, blood samples were collected following intravenous infusion of Hu1D10 and analyzed for phosphorylation of AKT. Two of 3 patient samples showed a sustained increase in AKT phosphorylation following Hu1D10 administration. These data suggest that Hu1D10 ligation in CLL cells induces death and survival signals for which combination therapies may be designed to greatly enhance efficiency of both Hu1D10 and other class II antibodies in development.","http://ashpublications.org/blood/article-pdf/103/5/1846/1695483/zh800504001846.pdf",""

The dense array can also be used as an approximate acoustical lens with appropriate prestack imaging techniques, similar to those used in medical imaging and nondestructive testing. Such use of the array provides flexibility when imaging with sparse shot distributions and improves the overall resolution of the array. We show how, with prestack focusing, one can extend the subsurface coverage beyond conventional common‐midpoint (CMP) coverage. We study optimal imaging configurations and show that although the effective aperture of the array is reduced when focusing off‐center targets, we can still image small targets adequately. Maximum aperture and therefore best target definition occur when the source and geophone arrays are on top of the target. Both synthetic and field results show that the limited‐aperture array can image very small targets with resolution of 0.25 m in three dimensions. We also demonstrate that different acquisition geometries should be used when imaging continuous geological targets versus small point diffractors.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/1.1836819",""

Further, simulators can also serve as excellent platforms for teaching difficult concepts in hardware and compilers, by allowing students hands-on access to hardware and software internals that may not be accessible otherwise.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1054907.1054908",""

It is well known that the identification problem created by the linear dependency of age, period, and cohort (Period = Age + Cohort or P = A + C) presents a major methodological challenge to APC analysis, a problem that has been widely addressed in demography, epidemiology, and statistics. This paper compares parameter estimates and model fit statistics produced by two solutions to the identification problem in age-period-cohort models—namely, the conventional demographic approach of constrained generalized linear models (Fienberg and Mason 1978, 1985; Mason and Smith 1985) and the intrinsic estimator method recently developed by Fu (2000; Knight and Fu 2000; Fu, Hall, and Rohan 2004). We report empirical analyses of applications of these two methods to population data on U.S. female mortality rates. Comparisons of parameter estimates suggest that both constrained generalized linear models and the intrinsic estimator method can yield similar estimates of age, period, and cohort effects, but estimates obtained by the intrinsic estimator are more direct and do not require prior information to select appropriate model identifying constraints. We also describe three statistical properties of the estimators: (1) finite-time-period bias, (2) relative statistical efficiency, and (3) consistency as the number of periods of observed data increases. These empirical analyses and theoretical results suggest that the intrinsic estimator may well provide a useful alternative to conventional methods for the APC analysis of demographic rates.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.0081-1750.2004.00148.x",""

We have initiated studies to define the molecular mechanisms by which a recent pathogenic isolate of WNV evades the host cell innate antiviral response. Biochemical and microarray analyses demonstrated that WNV induced the expression of beta interferon (IFN-β) and several IFN-stimulated genes late in infection of cultured human cells. The late expression of these antiviral genes was due to the delayed activation of the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3). Despite this host response, WNV was still able to replicate efficiently. The effect of the IRF-3 pathway on WNV replication was assessed by examining virus replication and spread in cultures of wild-type or IRF-3-null mouse embryo fibroblasts. The absence of IRF-3 was marked by a significant increase in plaque size and a sustained production of infectious particles. Although the activation of the IRF-3 pathway was not sufficient to block virus replication, our results suggest that IRF-3 target genes function to constrain WNV infection and limit cell-to-cell virus spread.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.78.14.7737-7747.2004",""

This occurs only at firing rates of 20–50 spikes/s and higher. Over this same frequency range, there is an increase in the steady-state frequency–intensity ( F– I) curve's slope (the secondary range). Specific blockade of high-voltage activated calcium currents reduced the F– I curve slope and reverse adaptation. Blockade of calcium-dependent potassium current enhanced secondary range firing. A simple model that exhibited these properties used spike-triggered conductances similar to those in subthalamic neurons. It showed: 1) Nonaccumulating spike afterhyperpolarizations produce positively accelerating F– I curves and spike-frequency adaptation that is complete after the second spike. 2) Combinations of accumulating aftercurrents result in a linear F– I curve, whose slope depends on the relative contributions of inward and outward currents. Spike-frequency adaptation can be gradual. 3) With both accumulating and nonaccumulating aftercurrents, primary and secondary ranges will be present in the F– I curve. The slope of the primary range is determined by the nonaccumulating conductance; the accumulating conductances govern the secondary range. The transition is determined by the relative strengths of accumulating and nonaccumulating currents. 4) Spike-threshold accommodation contributes to the secondary range, reducing its slope at high firing rates. Threshold accommodation can stabilize firing when inward aftercurrents exceed outward ones. 5) Steady-state reverse adaptation results when accumulated inward aftercurrents exceed outward ones. This requires spike-threshold accommodation. Transient speedup arises when inward currents are smaller than outward ones at steady state, but accumulate more rapidly. 6) The same mechanisms alter firing in response to irregular patterns of synaptic conductances, as cell excitability fluctuates with changes in firing rate.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jn.00924.2003",""

Yet these data are often costly or difficult to obtain. As such, recent research has focused on exploiting new technologies (e.g., cell phones) as cost-effective sources of speed and travel time information. Consistent with this work, a new source of data and an acquisition approach that provides both vehicle speed and travel time measurements from ad hoc probe vehicles at modest cost are presented. In this system, probe vehicles collect Global Positioning System speed, heading, and position data and transmit them over amateur radio frequencies. Frequencies are monitored by personal computers, which are used to receive and process the probe data. System output consists of records containing traveler location, speed, and the time at which data were transmitted. Moreover, these data are managed and maintained as layers of points in a geographic information system and lend themselves to use in several applications. Contrasted with the system described, most traditional speed measurement systems (e.g., loop sensors) are restricted to collecting data at fixed points along major highways where sensors are installed. However, probe data facilitate regional analysis since acquiring information from probe vehicles does not depend on fixed observation points. Some of these applications and advantages of the data are discussed, and a detailed comparison of speed data retrieved from the presented probe system and data collected by traffic loop sensors is provided. The analysis demonstrates that the described probe vehicle system is an effective transportation data source.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/1870-04",""

This study examines the effects on preparers of using two different methods of review: face-to-face and electronic review. The study also compares both review groups to a no-review control group. Consistent with the Heuristic-Systematic Model, we find that the method of review affects preparer effectiveness and efficiency. Specifically, preparers anticipating a face-to-face review are more concerned with audit effectiveness, produce higher quality judgments, are less efficient at their task, are less likely to be influenced by prior year workpapers, and feel more accountable than preparers in both the electronic review and no-review conditions. Interestingly, electronic review preparers generally do not differ from the no-review group. These results suggest that how a review will be conducted, and not merely the expectation that a review will occur, affects the decision-maker's judgments and perceptions.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article-pdf/79/4/949/18951/accr_2004_79_4_949.pdf",""

The Mre11 subunit exhibits nuclease activities in vitro, but the role of these activities in repair in mitotic cells has not been established. In this study we have performed a comparative study of three mutants (mre11-D16A, -D56N, and -H125N) previously shown to have reduced nuclease activities in vitro. In ends-in and ends-out chromosome recombination assays using defined plasmid and oligonucleotide DNA substrates, mre11-D16A cells were as deficient as mre11 null strains, but defects were small in mre11-D56N and -H125N mutants. mre11-D16A cells, but not the other mutants, also displayed strong sensitivity to ionizing radiation, with residual resistance largely dependent on the presence of the partially redundant nuclease Exo1. mre11-D16A mutants were also most sensitive to the S-phase-dependent clastogens hydroxyurea and methyl methanesulfonate but, as previously observed for D56N and H125N mutants, were not defective in NHEJ. Importantly, the affinity of purified Mre11-D16A protein for Rad50 and Xrs2 was indistinguishable from wild type and the mutant protein formed complexes with equivalent stoichiometry. Although the role of the nuclease activity has been questioned in previous studies, the comparative data presented here suggest that the nuclease function of Mre11 is required for RMX-mediated recombinational repair and telomere stabilization in mitotic cells.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/166/4/1701/42059456/genetics1701.pdf",""

Teams have been shown to exhibit constructive, aggressive/defensive, or passive/defensive interaction styles that affect communication and thus team performance by facilitating or hindering the exchange of information among group members. These styles reflect an aggregation of the behaviors exhibited by individual team members, which are rooted in their individual personalities. The effects of interaction style on team performance have been well established in face-to-face and virtual teams. Generally, constructive interaction styles produce positive outcomes whereas passive/defensive styles beget negative ones. Aggressive/defensive teams produce solutions that are correlated with the expertise of those that have wrested control of the group but there is often little support for those solutions. The current work explores how different constellations of extraversion and expertise manifest themselves into group interaction styles and, ultimately, outcomes. The study involves 248 professional managers from executive MBA and professional development programs in 63 virtual teams that performed an intellective task. Results show that expertise and extraversion to be curvilinearly related to group interactions and performance, and high levels of extraversion and higher variations in extraversion between team members lead to less constructive and more passive/defensive interaction styles within teams. Results show that although expertise is the best predictor of task performance, it is primarily group interaction styles that predict contextual outcomes (e.g., solution acceptance, cohesion, effectiveness) in virtual teams.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/968464.968469",""

The article uses Confucian values and norms, which are an ancient set of guidelines for social interaction, as the basis for introducing additional concerns to explain choice of conflict strategies in Chinese family businesses: concern for relationships, interpersonal norms, and collective interests. Two sets of moderating variables are introduced based on the unique features of Confucian ideology. They include differences in age, status, and gender between conflicting parties, and types of conflict – normative or personal goal related, and task or relationship.

The hovering flight of hummingbirds is one of the most energetically expensive forms of animal locomotion, but hummingbirds are nonetheless abundant at high elevations throughout the Americas. Two mechanisms enhance aerodynamic performance in high-elevation hummingbirds: increase in wing size and wing stroke amplitude during hovering. How do these changes in morphology, kinematics, and physical properties of air combine to influence the aerodynamic power requirements of flight across elevations? Here, we present data on the flight performance of 43 Andean hummingbird species as well as a 76-taxon multilocus molecular phylogeny that served as the historical framework for comparative analyses. Along a 4,000-m elevational transect, hummingbird body mass increased systematically, placing further aerodynamic demands on high-elevation taxa. However, we found that the minimum power requirements for hovering flight remain constant with respect to elevation because hummingbirds compensate sufficiently through increases in wing size and stroke amplitude. Thus, high-elevation hummingbirds are not limited in their capacity for hovering flight despite the challenges imposed by hypobaric environments. Other flight modes including vertical ascent and fast forward flight are more mechanically and energetically demanding, and we accordingly also tested for the maximum power available to hummingbirds by using a load-lifting assay. In contrast to hovering, excess power availability decreased substantially across elevations, thereby reducing the biomechanical potential for more complex flight such as competitive and escape maneuvers.","https://pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.0405260101",""

Stat1, Stat3, and Stat5 were activated in mouse epidermis after treatment with different classes of tumor promoters, including 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), okadaic acid, and chrysarobin. In addition, Stat1, Stat3, and Stat5 were constitutively activated in skin tumors generated by the two-stage carcinogenesis regimen using 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene as initiator and TPA as promoter. Several approaches were used to examine the possible role of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in modulating Stat3 activity during tumor promotion. In primary cultures of mouse keratinocytes, addition of exogenous EGF led to activation of Stat3 as shown by an elevation in tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. In epidermis of transgenic mice expressing transforming growth factor α under control of the keratin 14 promoter, Stat3 was constitutively activated. Abrogation of EGFR function in mouse epidermis using an EGFR kinase inhibitor or by overexpressing a dominant negative form of EGFR led to a reduction in Stat3 activation in response to TPA treatment. Immunoprecipitation analyses using lysates from TPA-treated epidermis and skin papillomas showed enhanced interaction between the EGFR and Stat3. Finally, Stat3 deficiency in mouse epidermis significantly reduced the proliferative response after TPA treatment. Collectively, the current results suggest that Stat3 activation may be a critical event during mouse skin tumor promotion, possibly through regulation of keratinocyte proliferation. In addition, Stat3 activation in tumor promoter-treated epidermis and in skin papillomas may occur, at least in part, via interaction with and phosphorylation by the EGFR. Finally, constitutive activation of Stat3 in both papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas suggest a role in both the development of autonomous growth and the progression of epithelial tumors in mouse skin.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/64/7/2382/2524051/2382.pdf",""

The Fila Costeña exposes three major thrust faults that imbricate the late Tertiary forearc basin sequence of the Térraba basin. The frontal thrust of the Fila Costeña marks the boundary between an uplifting inner forearc and a subsiding outer forearc, with only local uplift astride the indenting Cocos Ridge. On the basis of surface constraints a cross section across the thrust belt suggests that all three thrusts flatten into parallelism with a low‐angle décollement horizon near the contact between the basement and the cover sequence of the Térraba basin. This décollement lies at a depth of ∼4 km. The minimum shortening recorded by restoration of fault‐related folds is 17 km, or 45%. Observations of late Tertiary marine sediments, tilted and faulted late Quaternary fluvial terraces, and raised Holocene marine terraces indicate that Fila Costeña uplift was likely initiated in the Quaternary and is ongoing. Given that the coastal mountains are separated from the Talamanca Range by a valley, the décollement that delaminates the forearc basin from the underthrusting forearc must continue as a flat beneath the valley but must link with the plate boundary along a crustal‐scale ramp system, a structural geometry that has resulted in uplift of the Talamanca Range, the highest peaks in Central America. The dichotomy between uplift in the inner forearc and subsidence in the outer forearc is explained in terms of the response of an arcward thickening wedge to rough, subducting crust.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2002TC001464",""

Events from a range of back azimuths minimize the effects of multipathing. The resulting velocity model reveals a transition in lithospheric thickness from 200 km in the Great Plains to 45–55 km beneath the Rio Grande Rift, thickening beneath the Colorado Plateau to 120–150 km. The upper mantle low‐velocity signature of the rift is roughly twice the width of its surface morphology. An asthenospheric low‐velocity channel underlies the region west of the Great Plains and extends to 300 km depth. This channel is likely the result of warm mantle infill behind the sinking Farallon plate. Buoyant forces within this channel are sufficient to support much of the high elevation of the rift and plateau. No evidence for a deep mantle source is found beneath the rift, implying that present rifting is not driven by deep mantle upwelling. Velocities from 55 to 90 km beneath the rift axis are 10% slower than beneath the Great Plains, consistent with small amounts of partial melt. Low velocities extend to 200–300 km depth on either side of the rift but not directly beneath it, forming an inverted‐U shape. This feature may reflect mantle that has cooled through vertical advection in a subadiabatic environment. Upwelling may be reinforced by small‐scale convection caused by variations in lithospheric thickness and shallow mantle temperatures.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2003JB002575",""

Eight groups were held with community residents and two groups with providers of services to theMexican community. Factors inhibiting use of hospice services by Mexicans include knowledge of hospice programs, fear of discrimination by agencies, possible cost of hospice services, and language issues. Factors encouraging hospice usage were also cited. Hospice staff needs to understandMexican culture, provide good care, and encourage the patient. A number of approaches to promoting hospice use, dispelling myths about hospices, and providing information about hospices were suggested.

Several pathways for formation of these hematite deposits have been proposed, involving both aqueous and nonaqueous processes. This work uses the precise shape and position of spectral features in the Martian hematite thermal emission spectrum to constrain hematite formation pathways. Thermal infrared emission spectra, X‐ray powder diffraction patterns, Mössbauer spectra, and transmission electron microscope (TEM) photomicrographs were obtained for synthetic and natural hematite samples derived by (1) dehydroxylation of fine‐grained goethite and (2) oxidation of magnetite. Collectively, the instrumental analyses show that the mineralogical composition and crystal morphology of precursor samples and the time and temperature conditions under which decomposition to hematite occur determine the crystallinity and crystal morphology of the hematite product. Comparison of laboratory and MGS‐TES spectra shows that the Martian hematite spectra correspond closely with a synthetic hematite sample derived by pseudomorphic and topotactic dehydroxylation of goethite at 300°C. Spectra of goethite‐precursor samples dehydroxylated at higher temperatures provide increasingly poor fits. Spectra of hematite samples derived by high‐temperature thermal oxidation of magnetite are also poorer fits to the Martian hematite spectrum. Thermal emission spectra of goethites heated at lower temperatures are characterized by the spectral signatures of both hematite and goethite and are not consistent with the Martian spectra.

We conclude that gas is focused into the coarse‐grained sequence from a large volume of the accretionary complex and is trapped until high gas pressure forces the gas to migrate through the GHSZ to seafloor vents.

Seismic reflections from boundaries within granular sedimentary packs such as sands carry information about variation in the sediment properties. In this paper we analyze elastic contact mechanics models of granular media to show that within mineralogically uniform, homogeneously saturated sediments, the reflection strength can be theoretically related to variations in texture and porosity. The theoretical formulation indicates that in dry, mineralogically uniform sediments, seismic reflection amplitude depends strongly on changes in textures (such as angularity or sorting). In saturated sediments at low confining pressures, the reflection amplitude is primarily related to changes in porosity. Shallow seismic field data are interpreted quantitatively within the context of the theory. The field seismic data and supportive evidence from a nearby well are consistent with our interpretation of reflections arising from changes in textural properties of the sediment above the water table. This analysis can be used to quantify texture and porosity changes within sedimentary packets from measurements of seismic reflection strength and, thus, spatially map sedimentary properties in aquifers.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/1.1836824",""

Soils with this combination of characteristics frequently contain halloysite and Fe oxides. We hypothesized that platy kaolinite particles form a more compact mass than tubular halloysite particles, and that Fe oxides promote porous aggregation. To test this hypothesis the settling densities were determined for soil analogs constructed of kaolinite and halloysite clays with ferrihydrite and nonionic, anionic, and cationic organic surfactants as organic matter proxies. The samples were mixed in water and compacted by centrifugation. The hydraulic conductivity of each kaolinite‐ and halloysite‐based mixture was determined with a falling head permeameter. Halloysite samples had lower bulk densities than kaolinite samples with the same centrifugation. The addition of ferrihydrite decreased bulk density of sets of both mineral mixtures. Numerous small particles of ferrihydrite adhered to halloysite tubes in contrast to larger oxide masses formed among clean kaolinite plates, as shown in transmission electron micrographs. The greater frequency of ferrihydrite particles associated with halloysite than kaolinite crystals provided more sites for inter‐particle bonding and clay aggregation. Cationic and neutral organic polymers decreased the bulk density of halloysite soil analogs. The kaolinite analog response to polymer treatment varied. Anionic polymers appeared to increase the bulk density of both mineral mixtures that is attributed to increased particle dispersion. These results support the hypothesis that clay morphology and bonding agents influence soil bulk density and hydraulic conductivity of fabricated clay soils.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.2136%2Fsssaj2004.1452",""

Both diploid and tetraploid cottons exhibit negative crossover interference; i.e., double recombinants are unexpectedly abundant. We found no major structural changes between Dt and D chromosomes, but confirmed two reciprocal translocations between At chromosomes and several inversions. Concentrations of probes in corresponding regions of the various genomes may represent centromeres, while genome-specific concentrations may represent heterochromatin. Locus duplication patterns reveal all 13 expected homeologous chromosome sets and lend new support to the possibility that a more ancient polyploidization event may have predated the A-D divergence of 6–11 million years ago.

It was previously thought that these organs were used solely to aid in prey acquisition, but recent findings demonstrated that western diamondback rattlesnakes (Crotalus atrox) use them to direct behavioral thermoregulation, suggesting that facial pits might be general purpose organs used to drive a suite of behaviors. To investigate this further, we conducted a phylogenetic survey of viperine thermoregulatory behavior cued by thermal radiation. We assessed this behavior in 12 pitviper species, representing key nodes in the evolution of pitvipers and a broad range of thermal environments, and a single species of true viper (Viperidae:Viperinae), a closely related subfamily of snakes that lack facial pits but possess a putative thermal radiation receptor. All pitviper species were able to rely on their facial pits to direct thermoregulatory movements, while the true viper was unable to do so. Our results suggest that thermoregulatory behavior cued by thermal radiation is a universal role of facial pits and probably represents an ancestral trait among pitvipers. Further, they establish behavioral thermoregulation as a plausible hypothesis explaining the evolutionary origin of the facial pit.","http://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article-pdf/207/24/4231/1547055/4231.pdf",""

The absorption spectra obtained between 8K and room temperature, and between 1750 and 350nm, and the fluorescence spectrum obtained at 8K and observed between 1450 and 875nm are analyzed for transitions between individual energy (Stark) levels that characterize the energy-level structure of Nd3+ ions in D2 symmetry sites, replacing Y3+ ions in the garnet host lattice. A model Hamiltonian including atomic and crystal-field terms is diagonalized within the complete 4f3SLJMJ basis set which includes 364 states. The calculated splitting of the Nd3+ energy levels by the crystal field is compared with the experimental splitting observed in both the ceramic sample and a single-crystal laser rod. Both samples have approximately the same Nd3+ concentration, about 1at.%. By varying the atomic and crystal-field parameters, we obtain a standard deviation of 18cm−1 between 106 calculated-to-observed Stark levels found between the ground state and the D1∕24 at 28 369cm−1.

Each black shale unit grades upward into organically lean grey shale and abruptly overlies another grey shale unit. Within each black shale-grey shale sequence, ENE-trending vertical joints, interpreted to be hydraulic fractures, are best developed (i.e. more closely and uniformly spaced) in the organic-rich shale. Moreover, the density of ENE joints diminishes up-section through each black shale unit, as does the total organic carbon (TOC) content. While ENE joints are less well developed outside the black shale intervals, joints that formed during the Alleghanian orogeny (NW-trending) are found throughout the Upper Devonian shale sequence. Both sets are best developed in black shales in the distal delta sequence, whereas in more proximal deposits the Alleghanian joint sets are best developed in grey shales. Moreover, the density of ENE joints within each stratigraphic level of the black shale exceeds that of Alleghanian joints at the same level, except in the deepest black shale where Alleghanian joints are locally best developed at the top of the black shale interval. The preferential jointing of black shale units in the Appalachian Plateau reflects an extended hydrocarbon generation history.

The hematite and goethite concentrations are higher in interglacial paleosols than in glacial loess sediments, whereas the hematite/goethite (Hm/Gt) ratios are lower in paleosols than in loess. Such changes are consistent with higher precipitation and temperature and increased pedogenesis during interglaciation and lower precipitation and temperature and decreased pedogenesis during glaciation. The Hm/Gt ratio can be employed as a tool to assess short‐term variations in humidity and aridity of the EAM. The Hm/Gt ratios of the last glacial loess displays millennial‐scale abrupt climate oscillations, revealing a pattern of significantly reduced and enhanced summer monsoon moisture.

Hormonal stimulation enhances tumor risk in p53-null mammary epithelial cells as well as the incidence of aneuploidy. Aneuploidy appears in normal p53-null mammary epithelial cells within 5 weeks of hormone stimulation. Experiments reported herein assessed a possible mechanism of hormone-induced aneuploidy. Hormones increased DNA synthesis equally between wild-type (WT) and p53-null mammary epithelial cells. There were two distinct responses in p53-null cells to hormone exposure. First, Western blot analysis demonstrated that the levels of two proteins involved in regulating sister chromatid separation and the spindle checkpoint, Mad2 and separase (ESPL1) were increased in null compared with WT cells. In contrast, the levels of securin and Rad21 proteins were not increased in hormone-stimulated p53-null compared with WT cells. ESPL1 RNA was also increased in p53-null mouse mammary cells in vivo by 18 h of hormone stimulation and in human breast MCF7 cells in monolayer culture by 8 h of hormone stimulation. Furthermore, both promoters contained p53 and steroid hormone response elements. Mad2 protein was increased as a consequence of the absence of p53 function. The increase in Mad2 protein was observed also at the cellular level by immunohistochemistry. Second, hormones increased gene amplication in the distal arm of chromosome 2, as shown by comparative genomic hybridization. These results support the hypothesis that hormone stimulation acts to increase aneuploidy by several mechanisms. First, by increasing mitogenesis in the absence of the p53 checkpoint in G2, hormones allow the accumulation of cells that have experienced chromosome missegregation. Second, the absolute rate of chromosome missegregation may be increased by alterations in the levels of two proteins, separase and Mad2, which are important for maintaining chromosomal segregation and the normal spindle checkpoint during mitosis.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/64/16/5608/2517217/zch01604005608.pdf",""

Soil‐containing deposits in the Loess Plateau of central China offer a unique opportunity to study the relationship between soil reflectance and MS. In this paper, data on MS and diffuse reflectance spectra obtained from seven Loess Plateau sections were used to establish quantitative relationships between MS and spectral parameters related to remote sensing. By integrating the diffuse reflectance values corresponding to thematic mapper (TM) channels, five TM bands were simulated and served as independent variables for a multiple linear regression relating the bands to MS. The resulting calibration equation provides good estimates of MS values and has excellent correlation coefficients, >0.90, for all the test samples. The application of the regression equation for mapping soil MS was performed using the enhanced TM image from northwest part of Loess Plateau. The MS values obtained from TM data are convincing and compare well with the limited field test data. The spatial MS variations on the TM image clearly show a decrease toward the northwest and are in a good agreement with the monsoon directions. Results of this study demonstrate that the surface MS signal in soil can be mapped with data from satellite‐based remote sensors operating in the visible and near‐infrared bands. The future possibilities of this method in other soil types and climates need to be explored.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2003JB002769",""

However, evidence of the link between childhood and the mortality of adults is fragmentary, and the intervening mechanisms remain unclear. Drawing on the National Longitudinal Survey of Older Men, our analysis shows that men’s mortality is associated with an array of childhood conditions, including socioeconomic status, family living arrangements, mother’s work status, rural residence, and parents’ nativity. With the exception of parental nativity, socioeconomic-achievement processes in adulthood and lifestyle factors mediated these associations. Education, family income, household wealth, and occupation mediated the influence of socioeconomic status in childhood. Adult lifestyle factors, particularly body mass, mediated the effects of family living arrangements in childhood, mother’s work status, and rural residence. Our findings bring into sharp focus the idea that economic and educational policies that are targeted at children’s well-being are implicitly health policies with effects that reach far into the adult life course.","http://read.dukeupress.edu/demography/article-pdf/41/1/87/884000/87hayward.pdf",""

Many studies unquestionably assume that trust is intrinsically beneficial, and dismiss the possibility that the effects of trust may be dependent on the situation (or conditions) at present. This paper theoretically and empirically examines outcomes of an individual's trust in global virtual teams under differing situations (or conditions). In Study 1, we find that early in a team's existence, a member's trusting beliefs have a direct positive effect on his or her trust in the team and perceptions of team cohesiveness. Later on, however, a member's trust in his team operates as a moderator, indirectly affecting the relationships between team communication and perceptual outcomes. Study 2 similarly suggests that trust effects are sensitive to the particular situation or condition. Combined, the studies find that trust affects virtual teams differently in different situations. Future studies on trust will need to consider situational contingencies. This paper contributes to the literature on IT-enabled relationships by theorizing and empirically testing how trust affects attitudes and behaviors.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/isre.1040.0028",""

Salivary antibody assays provide an attractive alternative to collecting and testing serum or stool samples. Antibodies to Norwalk virus (NV) in oral fluid samples were compared with NV antibodies in serum collected from 38 volunteers challenged with NV inoculum. Pre- and postchallenge (day 4, 8, 14, and 21) saliva and serum samples were examined by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) using recombinant NV antigen. Of 18 infected subjects (those who shed NV in stool or who demonstrated immunoglobulin G [IgG] seroconversion), 15 (83%) had ≥4-fold increases in NV-specific salivary IgA and 15 (83%) had ≥4-fold increases in NV-specific salivary IgG when prechallenge and postchallenge saliva samples were compared. When the results of the IgA and IgG assays were combined, all 18 infected subjects showed ≥4-fold increases in NV-specific salivary IgG or IgA postchallenge titers compared to their prechallenge titers. One of 19 uninfected subjects had a ≥4-fold increase in NV-specific salivary IgG. The sensitivity of the combined assay results was 100%, and the specificity was 95%. NV-specific salivary IgA titers peaked around 14 days postchallenge. NV-specific salivary IgG and serum IgG titers continued to rise through 21 days postchallenge. The application of this EIA to an elementary school outbreak indicated that 67% of the subjects with confirmed infections had >4-fold rises in anti-NoV IgA when an antigen in the same genetic cluster as the outbreak virus was used. This is the first documented mucosal antibody response to NoV in children.

Patients and Methods: We analyzed 1,055 patients diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer between 1990 and 1996. Variables studied included socioeconomic factors, tumor characteristics, concurrent medical conditions, and treatment. The primary end point was recurrence-free survival (RFS). Multivariable analyses were performed using recursive partitioning and Cox proportional hazards regression. Results: The most significant difference in prognosis was between patients with fewer than four and those with at least four positive nodes (P < .0001). Four distinct prognostic groups (5-year RFS, 97%, 78%, 58%, and 27%) were developed, defined by the number of positive nodes, tumor size, progesterone receptor (PR) status, differentiation, race, and marital status. Patients with fewer than four positive nodes and tumor ≤ 2 cm, PR positive, and well or moderately differentiated had the best prognosis. RFS in this group was unaffected by type of adjuvant therapy (P = .38). Patients with at least four positive nodes and PR-negative tumors had the worst prognosis, and those treated with tamoxifen plus chemotherapy had the best outcome in this group (P = .0001). Among patients in the two intermediate-risk groups, those treated with tamoxifen or a combination of tamoxifen and chemotherapy had the best outcome. Conclusion: Lymph node status, PR status, tumor size, differentiation, race, and marital status are valuable for prognostication in breast cancer. The prognostic groups derived can provide guidance for clinical trial design, patient management, and future treatment policy.","https://ascopubs.org/doi/pdfdirect/10.1200/JCO.2004.11.141",""

Staggered‐in‐time loose coupling of flow and deformation via a high‐level numerical interface that repeatedly calls first flow and then mechanics allows us to leverage the decades of work put into individual flow and mechanics simulators while still capturing realistic coupled physics. These two processes are often naturally modeled using different time stepping schemes and different spatial grids—flow should only model the reservoir, whereas mechanics requires a grid that extends to the earth's surface for overburden loading and may extend further than the reservoir in the lateral directions. Although spatial and temporal variability between flow and mechanics can be difficult to accommodate with full coupling, it is easily handled via loose coupling. We calculate the total stress by adding pore pressures to the effective rock stress. In turn, changes in volume strain induce updates to porosity and permeability and, hence, dynamically alter the flow solution during simulation. Incorporating the resulting time‐dependent pressures, saturations, and porosities (from coupled flow and mechanics) into Gassmann's equations results in seismic wave velocities and densities that can differ markedly from those calculated from flow alone. In a synthetic numerical experiment based on Belridge field, California, incorporation of coupled flow and mechanical deformation into time‐lapse calculations produces compressional wave velocities that differ markedly from those produced by flow alone. In fact, it is the closing of the pores themselves (reduction in permeability) in this example which has the greatest impact on fluid pressures and saturations and, hence, elastic wave parameters such as velocity.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/1.1649388",""

We intend to describe the modulation of generalized ectromelia virus (EV) infection with exogenous administration of mrIFN-γ and mrTNF-α separately and in combination using susceptible BALB/c mice. The treatment schemes presented resulted in the localization of the generalized EV infection and its development into non-fatal sloughing of the infected limb. This was accompanied by low virus titres in the treated mice due to control of systemic virus replication and virus clearance. The balance of type I versus type II cytokines was dominated by a type I response in the treated groups. The group treated with the combination of IFN-γ and TNF-α exhibited the best survival with Th1-dominant (IFN-γ and IL-12) cytokine profiles, whereas the TNF-α-treated group of mice was less successful in clearance of virus and demonstrated the lowest survival rate. The successful cytokine treatment schemes in this orthopoxvirus model system may have important implications in the treatment of viral diseases in humans and, in particular, of variola virus infection.","https://academic.oup.com/cei/article-pdf/136/2/207/42145821/j.1365-2249.2004.02460.x.pdf",""

Fixing the receiver locations enables the design of quality control (QC) procedures that improve event identification. The number of shots, shot locations, and their effect on target illumination can be evaluated with various QC tools during acquisition to improve overall data quality. At the same time the portability of the array increases the cost effectiveness. Radially projected supergathers enable the choice of efficient processing parameters.

Starvation resistance is a quantitative trait controlled by multiple interacting genes and exhibits considerable genetic variation in natural populations. This genetic variation could be maintained in the face of strong selection due to a trade-off in resource allocation between reproductive activity and individual survival. Knowledge of the genes affecting starvation tolerance and the subset of genes that affect variation in starvation resistance in natural populations would enable us to evaluate this hypothesis from a quantitative genetic perspective. We screened 933 co-isogenic P-element insertion lines to identify candidate genes affecting starvation tolerance. A total of 383 P-element insertions induced highly significant and often sex-specific mutational variance in starvation resistance. We also used deficiency complementation mapping followed by complementation to mutations to identify 12 genes contributing to variation in starvation resistance between two wild-type strains. The genes we identified are involved in oogenesis, metabolism, and feeding behaviors, indicating a possible link to reproduction and survival. However, we also found genes with cell fate specification and cell proliferation phenotypes, which implies that resource allocation during development and at the cellular level may also influence the phenotypic response to starvation.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/166/4/1807/42059917/genetics1807.pdf",""

When quantities are discrete, there is no guarantee that derivatives of the utility function are equal to derivatives of the budget constraint. Moreover, when prices are nonlinear, as in the case of quantity discounts, first-order conditions can be associated with the minimum rather than the maximum value of utility. In these cases, the utility function must be directly evaluated to determine its maximum. This evaluation can be computationally challenging when there exist many offerings and when stochastic elements are introduced into the utility function. In this paper, we provide an economic model of demand for substitute brands that is flexible, parsimonious, and easy to implement. The methodology is demonstrated with a scanner panel data set of light-beer purchases.

To test the hypothesis that JSRV insertional mutagenesis is involved in the oncogenesis of OPA, we cloned and characterized 70 independent integration sites from 23 cases of OPA. Multiple integration sites were identified in most tumors. BLAST analysis of the sequences did not disclose any potential oncogenic motifs or any identical integration sites in different tumors. Thirty-seven of the integration sites were mapped to individual chromosomes by PCR with a panel of sheep-hamster hybrid cell lines. Integration sites were found on 20 of the 28 sheep chromosomes, suggesting a random distribution. However, four integration sites from four different tumors mapped to chromosome 16. By Southern blot hybridization, probes derived from two of these sites mapped to within 5 kb of each other on normal sheep DNA. These sites were found within a single sheep bacterial artificial chromosome clone and were further mapped to only 2.5 kb apart, within an uncharacterized predicted gene and less than 200 kb from a mitogen-activated protein kinase-encoding gene. These findings suggest that there is at least one common integration site for JSRV in OPA and add weight to the hypothesis that insertional mutagenesis is involved in the development of this tumor.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.78.16.8506-8512.2004",""

Drug therapies that have been shown to be beneficial in other forms of lipodystrophy and are currently being evaluated in HIV-associated lipodystrophy are also discussed. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search was conducted from 1996 to February 2003. Bibliographies of all articles were reviewed and pertinent articles were included. Abstracts from major meetings in 2002 and 2003 were also reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All published studies were included in the review. DATA SYNTHESIS: Lipodystrophy has become more prevalent in patients with HIV. Lipodystrophy consists of adipose redistribution and metabolic abnormalities including dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. Treatment of lipodystrophy has been directed at either decreasing the amount of visceral adipose tissue (VAT), dorsocervical adipose tissue (commonly known as buffalo hump) and/or increase subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT). Recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) decreases VAT and buffalo hump, although it has been associated with a high frequency of adverse effects. Metformin and the thiazolidinediones have favorable metabolic effects, but were not found to be effective in correcting body compositional changes associated with lipodystrophy. Anabolic steroids and L-carnitine are not effective in the treatment of lipodystrophy. CONCLUSION: No drug therapy exists to fully ameliorate or correct the cosmetic changes of HIV-associated lipodystrophy. Clinicians must weigh the benefits and risks of each agent and individualize treatment for each patient.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1345/aph.1D081",""

Early Harvest (applied in the seed furrow) or Early Harvest TST (applied as a dry seed treatment) followed by four foliar applications (four-leaf peanut, initial pegging, 14 d after initial pegging, and pod fill), was compared to non-treated peanut in five, 13, and three experiments in these respective states. Early Harvest did not affect pod yield or gross economic value of peanut regardless of location, cultivar, or edaphic and environmental conditions. These data suggest that a spray program consisting of Early Harvest most likely will not improve pod yield or gross economic value of peanut.","http://meridian.allenpress.com/peanut-science/article-pdf/31/2/70/1856371/pnut_31_2_0002.pdf",""

The etch-induced roughness is investigated using atomic force microscopy by systematically varying plasma power, chamber pressure, and Cl2/Ar mixture gas composition. GaN etches three to four times more rapidly than AlN for identical plasma conditions. For both GaN and AlN, we find that the surface roughness is correlated to etch rate. Induced roughness remains comparable to the as-grown value provided etching is carried out below rates 400 (GaN) and 90 nm/min (AlN). Above these cutoff etch rates, the roughness increases in proportion to etch rate. This result is independent of plasma parameters varied to produce the higher etching rates. By analyzing the surface properties through the power spectral density (PSD), we correlate roughness with the formation of fine-scale features present as a consequence of more aggressive etching. The cutoff etch rates and spatial-frequency dependence of the PSD are interpreted using the theory of kinetic roughening. A low-frequency range exhibits saturation corresponding to large-scale feature sizes, and a high-frequency regime exhibits scaling properties.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/95/9/4635/18708990/4635_1_online.pdf",""

In addition, the loss of methyl species during plasma exposure increases their susceptibility to water absorption leading to increased dielectric permittivities. In this article, we introduce a process in which silylating agents dissolved in supercritical CO2 are used to functionalize ash-damaged surfaces. This silylation process greatly decreases the time necessary to induce hydrophobicity (less than 1 min as determined by a change in contact angle from 18° to 90°). The process also reduces the concentration of reactive silylation agents needed for full hydrophobicity to less than 1 vol %. Further, this process is also shown to reduce material loss during subsequent wet etch processes. Film thickness measured by scanning electron microscopy before and after treatment illustrates a difference of approximately 0.1 μm after etching in a dilute HF solution for 30 s.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-pdf/22/3/1210/12225508/1210_1_online.pdf",""

This is reflected as a dramatic decrease in the junction depth. We find that the silicon nitride influences the concentration of hydrogen in the silicon dioxide during the final source/drain anneal. The presence of H enhances the diffusivity of B in the silicon dioxide and thereby results in a significant dose loss from the Si into the silicon dioxide.

We find evidence that allocations based on past performance and random draw rules lead to the highest fairness perceptions and the lowest expectations that the decisions made will lead to intragroup conflict. However, fairness judgments are also influenced by a variety of other factors, such as the type of resource being allocated and whether the recipient is advantaged or disadvantaged relative to others in the workgroup (what we term the “egocentric interaction”).

We evaluated HCV-IFN interactions within a long-term culture system of Huh7 cell lines harboring different variants of an HCV type 1b subgenomic RNA replicon that differed at only two sites within the NS5A-encoding region. A replicon with a K insertion at HCV codon 2040 replicated efficiently and exhibited sequence stability in the absence of host antiviral pressure. In contrast, a replicon with an L2198S point mutation replicated poorly and triggered a cellular response characterized by IFN-β production and low-level IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. When maintained in long term-culture, the L2198S RNA evolved into a stable high-passage (HP) variant with six additional point mutations throughout the HCV protein-encoding region that enhanced viral replication. The HP RNA transduced Huh7 cells with more than 1,000-fold greater efficiency than its L2198S progenitor or the K2040 sequence. Replication of the HP RNA resisted suppression by IFN-α treatment and was associated with virus-directed reduction in host cell expression of ISG56, an antagonist of HCV RNA translation. Accordingly, the HP RNA was retained within polyribosome complexes in vivo that were refractory to IFN-induced disassembly. These results identify ISG56 as a translational control effector of the host response to HCV and provide direct evidence to link this response to viral sequence evolution, ISG regulation, and selection of the IFN-resistant viral phenotype.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.78.21.11591-11604.2004",""

The three research questions were: 1) Which cognitive tools are used for which cognitive processes? 2) Is there a relationship between the extent of students' engagement in cognitive processing and their cognitive tool use? and 3) Are there any differences in cognitive tool use and performance scores between students who are engaged in different patterns of cognitive processing? The findings showed that different cognitive tools were used for different cognitive processes, and the degree of engagement in cognitive processing was positively related to the frequency of tool use. These results indicate that there is a connection between cognitive tool use and cognitive processing. In addition, tool use patterns reflected different characteristics of the learners (information processing versus metacognition oriented). Students who were more metacognitively oriented were more consistent in their tool selection, while students who were more information processing oriented were more action oriented in performing the tasks. However, there was no difference in the diversity of tool use or the performance scores between the two groups of students.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2190/LK2G-8K25-RB8U-PGE9",""

The results indicate that school psychologists are assessing ELLs from many different language groups, Spanish being the most common language group assessed. A significant number of school psychologists used interpreters when assessing ELLs. The following assessment methods were employed by over 90% of the respondents: behavioral observation, child interview, teacher interview, and parent interview.

Only 223 of the respondents indicated that they had assessed ELLs. The results indicate that school psychologists are assessing ELLs from many different language groups, Spanish being the most common language group assessed. A significant number of school psychologists used interpreters when assessing ELLs. The following assessment methods were employed by over 90% of the respondents: behavioral observation, child interview, teacher interview, and parent interview. These four methods were judged to be very helpful. The most frequently used measures included Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test (75.8%), Draw-A-Person (71.7%), House-Tree-Person (58.4%), Kinetic Family Drawing (55.3%), and Generic Sentence Completion Forms (52.5%). The Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans (ARSMA), all BASC measures (PRS in English and Spanish, TRS, SRP, SDH, and SOS), Million, and Haak Sentence Completion obtained the highest mean ratings for level of helpfulness.

Two constitutive laws for the elastic medium are considered: the Mooney potential, and Landau’s expansion of the strain energy density. These two constitutive laws are compared at quadratic order to obtain a relation between their respective elastic constants. Attention is devoted to the relative importance of shear stress on the bubble dynamics, allowing for the equilibrium gas pressure in the bubble to differ substantially from the pressure at infinity. The model for the bubble motion is approximated to quadratic order to assess the importance of shear stress in the surrounding medium relative to that of the gas pressure in the bubble. Relations are derived for the value of the shear wave speed at which the two contributions are comparable, which provide an assessment of when shear stress in the surrounding medium must be taken into account when modeling bubble dynamics.","https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article-pdf/115/2/581/8093669/581_1_online.pdf",""

Patients and Methods: Patients diagnosed with single primary lung, melanoma, breast, renal, or colorectal cancer (1973 to 2001) in the Metropolitan Detroit Cancer Surveillance System (MDCSS) were used for analysis. IP of brain metastases by primary site and variable of interest (race, sex, age at diagnosis of primary cancer, and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results [SEER] stage of primary cancer) was calculated with 95% CIs. Results: Total IP percentage (IP%) of brain metastases was 9.6% for all primary sites combined, and highest for lung (19.9%), followed by melanoma (6.9%), renal (6.5%), breast (5.1%), and colorectal (1.8%) cancers. Racial differences were seen with African Americans demonstrating higher IP% of brain metastases compared with other racial groups for most primary sites. IP% was significantly higher for female patients with lung cancer, and significantly higher for male patients with melanoma. The highest IP% of brain metastases occurred at different ages at diagnoses: age 40 to 49 years for primary lung cancer; age 50 to 59 years for primary melanoma, renal, or colorectal cancers; and age 20 to 39 for primary breast cancer. IP% significantly increased as SEER stage of primary cancer advanced for all primary sites. Conclusion: Total IP% of brain metastases was lower than previously reported, and it varied by primary site, race, sex, age at diagnosis of primary cancer, and SEER stage of primary cancer.","https://ascopubs.org/doi/pdfdirect/10.1200/JCO.2004.12.149",""

In spite of enthusiasm about the potential for E‐curriculum to enhance dental education, there is minimal guidance in the literature to assist schools with implementation. The study objectives were: 1) identify U.S. and Canadian dental schools that have initiated mandatory laptop programs and assess cost, faculty development issues, extent of curricular use, problems, and qualitative perceptions; 2) determine the extent to which twenty‐two other E‐curriculum resources were available and used at North American dental schools; and 3) identify factors that influenced E‐curriculum implementation. A twenty‐six item questionnaire, known as the Electronic Curriculum Implementation Survey (ECIS), was mailed to all sixty‐six North American dental schools (ten Canadian and fifty‐six U.S. schools) during 2002–03 with a response rate of 100 percent. Twenty‐five of the twenty‐six ECIS questions employed a menu‐driven, forced choice format, but respondents could provide amplifying comments. Fifty‐three questionnaires were completed by associate deans for academic affairs, three by deans, and ten by instructional technology (IT) managers, IT committee chairs, or directors of dental informatics departments. The survey found that E‐curriculum implementation among North American dental schools is following the classic innovation pattern in which a few early adopting institutions proceed rapidly while the majority of potential adopters make modifications slowly. Fourteen U.S. dental schools have established mandatory laptop programs for students. Ten of these laptop programs were created in the past two years; respondents reported numerous growing pains but were generally pleased with their progress. Other E‐curriculum capabilities were incorporated into courses more frequently at laptop schools than the fifty‐two non‐laptop schools including websites, online course evaluations, and instructor use of email to communicate with students. Few dental schools use online courses, and at most schools, few faculty have received training in online instructional techniques. Virtually all North American dental schools have provided substantial instructional technology resources to their faculty, but use of twenty‐two components and capabilities of E‐curriculum was limited, especially at schools without laptop programs. Various faculty‐related issues were reported as implementation barriers including lack of time, skill, and incentive to develop educational software. We conclude that many North American dental schools, especially those with laptop programs, are functioning at the “learn by doing” phase of initial implementation in a four‐stage innovation adoption model. E‐curriculum planners should pay close attention to implementation problems that occur at this stage where many innovation efforts break down.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fj.0022-0337.2004.68.10.tb03851.x",""

The 4-D PES has been calculated for (HBr)2 using second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory with an augmented and polarized 6-311G basis set. The potential is characterized by a global minimum occurring at the H bond structure with the distance between the center of masses (CM) of the monomer being RCM=4.10 Å with angles θA=10°, θB=100° and a well depth of 692.2 cm−1, θA is the angle the HBr bond of monomer A makes with the vector from the CM of A to the CM of B, and θB is the corresponding angle monomer B makes with the same CM–CM vector. The barrier for the H interchange occurs at the closed C2h structure for which RCM=4.07 Å, θA=45°, θB=135°, and the barrier height is 73.9 cm−1. The PES was fitted using a linear-least squares method and the rovibrational energy levels of the complex were calculated by a split pseudospectral method.

These signals have been termed “redundant” because targeting can still occur with only one signal. We now report that separate targeting motifs within both Pmp47 and Pex8 provide complementary function. Pmp47 is an ATP translocator that contains six transmembrane domains (TMDs). We had previously shown that the TMD2 region (termed TMD2R, consisting of TMD2 and a short adjacent segment of cytosolic loop) was required for targeting to proliferated peroxisomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We now report that the analogous TMD4R, which cannot target to proliferated peroxisomes, targets at least as well, or much better (depending on strain and growth conditions) in cells containing only basal (i.e., nonproliferated) peroxisomes. These data suggest differences in the targeting pathway among peroxisome populations. Pex8p, a peripheral protein facing the matrix, contains a typical carboxy terminal targeting sequence (PTS1) that has been shown to be nonessential for targeting, indicating the existence of a second targeting domain (not yet defined in S. cerevisiae); thus, its function was unknown. We show that targeting to basal peroxisomes, but not to proliferated peroxisomes, is more efficient with the PTS1 than without it. Our results indicate that multiple targeting signals within peroxisomal proteins extend coverage among heterogeneous populations of peroxisomes and increase efficiency of targeting in some metabolic states.","",""

The model involves collective modes of a cold electron core confined within a positively charged ion background. The response of the electron core to the laser field is similar to that of a weakly nonlinear oscillator driven by an external force. In particular, there is a resonant enhancement of the third harmonic when the frequency of the applied field is close to one third of the core eigenfrequency. It is shown that density nonuniformity or nonspherical shape of the ion background is necessary for harmonic generation. Particle-in-cell simulations have been performed to model the time evolution of the third harmonic response as the ion density profile changes due to cluster expansion. The simulation results are consistent with the predictions of the cold electron core model. In addition, the code quantifies the role of stochastic electron heating, an alternative harmonic generation mechanism.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pop/article-pdf/11/7/3349/19141763/3349_1_online.pdf",""

The method uses a 12.7-mm-diam sealed stainless steel spherical pressure vessel to impose three-dimensional isotropic constraints. The vessel is instrumented with strain gauges and thermocouples. Both isotropic stresses and reaction kinetics during cure at cure temperatures as high as 300 °C can be measured. In addition, measurement of the isotropic stress as a function of temperature yields the thermal pressure coefficient in both the glassy and rubbery (or liquid) states. Experimental results are presented for sucrose benzoate, a pressure-transmitting oil di-2-ethylhexylsebacate and an epoxy resin. The method provides reproducible estimates for the thermal pressure coefficient and the stresses are highly isotropic. A suggestion for improved versions of the device is: thicker walled vessels can be used to increase the upper stress limit (currently at 30 MPa). Also if a lower temperature range is to be studied, then aluminum can be used as a vessel material. Since epoxy resins have better adhesion to aluminum than to stainless steel, there may be an advantage to this.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/rsi/article-pdf/75/10/3327/19251812/3327_1_online.pdf",""

We hypothesized that inhibition of phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R) expressed on tumor cells and tumor-associated endothelial cells, which is associated with tumor progression, in combination with paclitaxel would inhibit experimental prostate cancer bone metastasis and preserve bone structure. We tested this hypothesis in nude mice, using human PC-3MM2 prostate cancer cells. PC-3MM2 cells growing adjacent to bone tissue and endothelial cells within these lesions expressed phosphorylated EGF-R and PDGF-Rα and -β on their surfaces. The percentage of positive endothelial cells and the intensity of receptor expression directly correlated with proximity to bone tissue. Oral administration of PKI166 inhibited the phosphorylation of EGF-R but not PDGF-R, whereas oral administration of STI571 inhibited the phosphorylation of PDGF-R but not EGF-R. Combination therapy using oral PKI166 and STI571 with i.p. injections of paclitaxel induced a high level of apoptosis in tumor vascular endothelial cells and tumor cells in parallel with inhibition of tumor growth in the bone, preservation of bone structure, and reduction of lymph node metastasis.

Techniques such as loop invariant code motion, loop unrolling and loop peeling have demonstrated their utility in compiler optimizations. However, many of these techniques can only be used in very limited cases when the loops are ""well-structured"" and easy to analyze. For instance, loop invariant code motion works only when invariant code is inside loops; loop unrolling and loop peeling work effectively when the array references are either constants or affine functions of index variable. It is our contention that there are many opportunities overlooked by limiting the optimizations to ""well structured"" loops. In many cases, even ""badly-structured"" loops may be transformed into ""well structured"" loops. As a case in point, we show how some loop-dependent code can be transformed into loop-independent code by transforming the loops. Our technique described in this paper relies on unfolding the loop for several initial iterations such that more opportunities may be exposed for many other existing compiler optimization techniques such as loop invariant code motion, loop peeling, loop unrolling and so on.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/967278.967284",""

In this study, phylogenetic analysis of 5′-noncoding sequences was optimized using rab17, a well-characterized ABA-responsive gene from maize, and five additional rab16/17 homologs from sorghum and rice. Conserved 5′-noncoding sequences among the maize, sorghum, and rice rab16/17 homologs were identified with the aid of the software program FootPrinter and by screening for known transcription-factor-binding sites. Searches for 7 of 8 (7/8)bp sequence matches within aligned 5′-noncoding segments of the rab genes identified many of the cis-elements previously characterized by biochemical analysis in maize rab17 plus several additional putative regulatory elements. Differences in the composition of conserved noncoding sequences among rab16/17 genes were related to variation in rab gene mRNA levels in different tissues and to response to ABA treatment using qRT-PCR. Absence of a GRA-like element in the promoter of sorghum dhn2 relative to maize rab17 was correlated with an ∼85-fold reduction of dhn2 RNA in sorghum shoots. Overall, we conclude that phylogenetic analysis of gene families among rice, sorghum, and maize will help identify regulatory sequences in the noncoding regions of genes and contribute to our understanding of grass gene regulatory networks.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/168/3/1639/42223205/genetics1639.pdf",""

FliG interacts directly with the Mot protein complex of the stator to generate torque, and it is a crucial player in switching the direction of flagellar rotation from clockwise (CW) to counterclockwise and vice versa. A primarily helical linker joins the N-terminal assembly domain of FliG, which is firmly attached to the FliF protein of the MS ring of the basal body, to the motility domain that interacts with MotA/MotB. We report here the results of a mutagenic analysis focused on what has been called the hinge region of the linker. Residue substitutions in this region generate a diversity of phenotypes, including motors that are strongly CW biased, infrequent switchers, rapid switchers, and transiently or permanently paused.

Patients and Methods: Patients with stage III/IV ovarian cancer who had a complete clinical response to primary treatment were randomly assigned to oregovomab or placebo administered at weeks 0, 4, and 8, and every 12 weeks up to 2 years or until recurrence. The primary end-point was time to relapse (TTR). Results: One hundred forty-five patients were treated with oregovomab (n = 73) or placebo (n = 72). For the population overall, median TTR was not different between treatments at 13.3 months for oregovomab and 10.3 months for placebo (P = .71). Immune responses were induced in most actively treated patients. This was associated with prolonged TTR. Quality of life was not adversely impacted by treatment. Adverse events were reported with similar frequency in oregovomab and placebo groups, indicating a benign safety profile. A long-term survival follow-up is ongoing. Cox analysis of relapse data identified significant factors: performance status, CA-125 before third cycle, and baseline CA-125. Further evaluation identified a subpopulation with favorable prognostic indicators designated as the successful front-line therapy (SFLT) population. For the SFLT population, TTR was 24.0 months in the oregovomab group compared with 10.8 months for placebo (unadjusted hazard ratio of 0.543 [95% CI, 0.287 to 1.025]), a hypothesis-generating observation. Conclusion: Consolidation therapy with oregovomab did not significantly improve TTR overall. A set of confirmatory phase III studies has been initiated to determine whether the SFLT population derives benefit from oregovomab treatment.","https://ascopubs.org/doi/pdfdirect/10.1200/JCO.2004.09.016",""

In this paper, a physical approximation has been introduced to analyze the nonlinear Poisson’s equation in a one-dimensional (1-D) cylindrical vacuum diode. With the help of this physical approximation, a solution for the space-charge-limited current for 1-D cylindrical diodes has been investigated and developed. In addition, a comparison between our approximate result and the Langmuir–Blodgett numerical solution shows that the physical approximation method is valid in nonlinear differential equation analyses.

We have computed the free energy of the peptide as a function of its position relative to the tunnel exit and also studied the properties of the conformational ensemble, when the peptide’s position is restricted at different points along the tunnel. Confining the peptide within a sufficiently wide tunnel stabilizes the folded state. The protein then remains folded as it moves towards the tunnel exit. However, when the diameter D of the tunnel is below a certain critical value Dc, confinement destabilizes the folded state and forces the peptide to assume an extended configuration. In this case, as the peptide progresses towards the tunnel exit and eventually leaves the tunnel, it goes through a series of compact, misfolded conformations and eventually folds when it gets close to the exit. The critical tunnel diameter Dc is comparable to the width of ribosomal tunnels.

There are few reports, however, of the use of this neuroleptic agent to control the severe delirium and agitation that may occur in critically ill pediatric patients or acute pediatric patients suffering from burn wounds. We assessed the effectiveness and safety of the use of haloperidol by completing a retrospective chart review of 855 acutely ill children treated consecutively during the period from April 1999 to May 2002, during which time 26 children received haloperidol. The safe use of haloperidol was assessed by documenting any adverse effects or reactions observed after the administration of the drug. Of patients given haloperidol, 23% had adverse effects. This result suggests that the use of haloperidol to treat the acutely agitated and delirious pediatric burn patients is fraught with a number of difficulties and is not completely safe and effective.","https://academic.oup.com/jbcr/article-pdf/25/6/472/23047621/00004630-200411000-00007.pdf",""

The purpose of this study was to facilitate the preoperative planning process for distal tibial osteotomy by determining angular correction obtained with various wedge heights. Methods:: Measurements of the distal tibia were taken from cadaver specimens to develop a database of average distal tibial widths. A distal tibial osteotomy was then done on the cadaver specimens with the placement of wooden block wedges of various heights at the osteotomy site. Preoperative and postoperative radiographic measurements of the joint surface angle were obtained on all specimens. The measured amount of angular change was compared to the mathematically predicted angular change using the formula ta θ = H/W. Results:: The mathematical model accurately predicted the amount of measured angular correction of the distal tibial articular surface. There was an approximate 2-degree angular change of the articular surface per millimeter of wedge height. As the tibial width increased, a smaller amount of angular correction per millimeter of wedge height was noted, and as wedge height increased with the same tibial width, less angular correction was obtained per millimeter of wedge height. Conclusion:: With appropriate preoperative planning, an accurate prediction can be made as to the amount of ankle joint correction that should be obtained with surgery. The size of the wedge that will provide the desired amount of correction can be accurately determined preoperatively.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/107110070402501104",""

The storage of CO2 in residual gas emerges as a potentially very significant issue meriting further study.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) was expressed at high levels in the prostate cancer cell line PC-3 but not in ECs. In contrast to previous findings by others, PPAR-γ ligands did not induce PPAR-γ expression in EC or PC-3. The present study examined the relationship between PPAR-γ and COX-2 expression patterns in EC and PC-3 in the presence and absence of serum and/or the PPAR-γ agonist 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2). We also evaluated the effects that the forced expression of PPAR-γ1 and PPAR-γ2 had on COX-2 in ECs. We found that expression of PPAR-γ and COX-2 protein was inversely correlated in ECs and PC-3. Low COX-2 expression in PC-3 was up-regulated by serum, and 15d-PGJ2 blocked serum-induced COX-2 expression and activity in a dose-dependent manner. 15d-PGJ2 had no effect on COX-2 expression in ECs or PPAR-γ expression in either cell type. However, forced expression of PPAR-γ1 or PPAR-γ2 in ECs suppressed the high level of endogenous COX-2. This effect was not isoform specific and was augmented by 15d-PGJ2. The present study showed that PPAR-γ activation can be an important regulator of COX-2 in prostate cells and may be an important target for prostate cancer chemoprevention.","https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article-pdf/13/11/1704/1748549/1704-1709.pdf",""

Two xenograft studies were conducted using cp70 cells stably expressing green fluorescent protein (cp70-GFP) subcutaneously transplanted into NU/NU mice. For studies 1 and 2, α-TEA was formulated in liposomes and delivered by aerosol such that approximately 36 μg and 72 μg of α-TEA were deposited in the respiratory tract of each mouse each day, respectively. Cisplatin at 5 mg/kg was administered by intraperitoneal injections once weekly for the first 3 weeks in Study 1 and on the third and 10th days following treatment initiation in Study 2. The combination α-TEA + cisplatin treatment reduced tumor burden and metastasis of cp70-GFP cells in comparison to control mice or mice treated with α-TEA or cisplatin singly. A significant reduction (P < 0.001) in growth of subcutaneous transplanted tumors was obtained with α-TEA + cisplatin for both studies. Visible metastases were observed in the lungs of animals from control and cisplatin-treated groups but not in animals from the α-TEA- or α-TEA + cisplatin–treated groups. The α-TEA + cisplatin significantly reduced the total number of lung and axillary lymph node micrometastasis (P < 0.03 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Analyses of tumor sections showed the α-TEA + cisplatin treatment group, in comparison to control, to have a significantly lower level of cell proliferation (Ki-67 staining; P < 0.0001) and a significantly higher level of apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated nick end labeling [TUNEL]; P < 0.0001). In summary, combinations of α-TEA + cisplatin significantly reduced tumor burden and metastases in a xenograft model of cisplatin-resistant human ovarian cancer cells.

Although it is widely accepted that sequences with important functionality tend to be less variable across species because of selective pressure, to what extent evolutionary conservation is mirrored by epidemiological outcome has never been demonstrated. In this study, we surveyed odds ratios detected for 46 SNPs in 39 different cancer-related genes from 166 molecular epidemiological studies. The conservation levels of amino acid that these SNPs affected were calculated as a tolerance index by comparing sequences from different species. Our results provide evidence of a significant relationship between the detected odds ratios associated with cancer risk and the conservation levels of the SNP-affected amino acids (P = 0.002; R2 = 0.06). Tolerance indices were further calculated for 355 nonsynonymous SNPs identified in 90 human DNA repair genes, of which 103 caused amino acid changes in very conserved positions. Our findings support the concept that SNPs altering the conserved amino acids are more likely to be associated with cancer susceptibility. Using such a molecular evolutionary approach may hold great promise for prioritizing SNPs to be genotyped in future molecular epidemiological studies.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/64/6/2251/2523579/zch00604002251.pdf",""

The excitement which accompanies the receipt of a large NSF funded program results in an initial enthusiasm and energy that is contagious for both faculty and students. The initial results of a “pilot” program are almost always improved course content, better student attitudes, better retention, etc. However, when the rush wears off and the new courses have to be institutionalized, what happens? What can be learned from consistent, long-term efforts to assess and improve the sophomore engineering science courses? This paper focuses on the introductory sophomore materials science course, Principles of Materials Engineering (ENGR 213). Using data collected from students and evaluation of student performance as measured by course grades and a standardized test, the authors will examine what has been learned since the inception of the course.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2004-62023/2622766/211_1.pdf",""

Current streamline models are limited in their ability to incorporate complex physical processes and cross-streamline mechanisms in a computationally efficient manner. A unique feature of streamline models is their ability to efficiently compute the sensitivity of the production data with respect to reservoir parameters using a single flow simulation. These sensitivities define the relationship between changes in production response because of small changes in reservoir parameters and thus, form the basis for many history matching algorithms. In our approach, we utilize the streamline-derived sensitivities to facilitate history matching during finite-difference simulation. First, the velocity field from the finite-difference model is used to compute streamline trajectories, time of flight and parameter sensitivities. The sensitivities are then utilized in an inversion algorithm to update the reservoir model during finite-difference simulation.","https://onepetro.org/SPEIOR/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/89447-MS/2885912/spe-89447-ms.pdf",""

The noncoding region of exon 2 of the p73 gene has two polymorphisms that are in complete linkage disequilibrium with one another, which may alter translation efficiency of the p73 protein. To test the hypothesis that this p73 polymorphism plays a role in the etiology of lung cancer, we conducted a hospital-based case-control study of 1054 patients newly diagnosed with lung cancer and 1139 cancer-free controls and evaluated the association between the p73 variant AT allele and risk of lung cancer. Cancer-free controls were frequency matched to the cases by age (±5 years), sex, and smoking status, and all subjects were non-Hispanic whites. The variant AT allele and genotypes were more common among the cases than among the controls (P = 0.0007 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively). Compared with the GC/GC genotype, the variant GC/AT and AT/AT genotypes were associated with a statistically significantly increased risk for lung cancer [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.10–1.59 and OR = 1.54, 95% CI, 1.05–2.26, respectively] in an allele dose-effect relationship (trend test: P &lt; 0.001).

Liposomal formulations of VES delivered by aerosol significantly reduced tumor burden and lung metastasis, but not lymph node metastasis. Unlike α-TEA, VES was ineffective in reducing tumor burden and metastasis to lungs and lymph nodes when administered orally. Analyses of tumor sections showed that α-TEA delivered by either method significantly reduced tumor cell proliferation as measured by KI67, and increased apoptosis as measured by terminal deoxynucleotldyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL), whereas VES delivered by aerosol reduced tumor cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, but not significantly.

Here, we established cultures of murine bone microvascular endothelial cells and examined their response to stimulation with PDGF BB ligand and to blockade of PDGF-R signaling with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 (Gleevec). The addition of STI571 to cultures of bone endothelial cells blocked PDGF BB-induced phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner and completely abrogated the activation of downstream targets Akt and ERK1/2. Coadministration of STI571 and Taxol also induced the activation of procaspase-3 and significant apoptosis. These data suggest that phosphorylation of PDGF-R stimulates survival pathways in bone endothelial cells and that by selectively inhibiting PDGF-R signaling with STI571, the cells are rendered sensitive to Taxol treatment. The therapeutic combination of STI571 and Taxol may be a powerful tool for targeting tumor-associated endothelial cells in the skeletal compartment.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/64/11/3727/2515020/zch01104003727.pdf",""

We apply PSI microscopy for temperature dependent stress measurements of the GaN films. Variations found in the stress–temperature coefficient correlate well with threading dislocation densities.

The minimum χ2 method is used to find a good estimator for the rain-rate distribution between the gamma and lognormal distributions, which are popularly used in the simulation of the rain-rate PDF. Results are sensitive to the choice of dynamic range, but both the gamma and lognormal distributions match well with the PDF of rainfall data. Comparison with sample means shows that the parametric mean from the lognormal distribution overestimates the sample mean, whereas the gamma distribution underestimates it. These differences are caused by the inflated tail in the lognormal distribution and the small shape parameter in the gamma distribution. If shape constraint is given, the difference between the sample mean and the parametric mean from the fitted gamma distribution decreases significantly, although the resulting χ2 values slightly increase. Of interest is that a consistent regional preference between two test functions is found. The gamma fits outperform the lognormal fits in wet regions, whereas the lognormal fits are better than the gamma fits for dry regions. Results can be improved with a specific model assumption depending on mean rain rates, but the results presented in this study can be easily applied to develop the rainfall retrieval algorithm and to find the proper statistics in the rainfall data.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jamc/article-pdf/43/11/1586/3292586/jam2165_1.pdf",""

Total electron content (TEC) measurements from GPS instruments augment observations from more traditional ionospheric instruments like ionospheric sounders and Langmuir probes. This volume of data creates both an opportunity and a need for the observations to be collected into coherent synoptic scale maps. This paper describes the Ionospheric Data Assimilation Three‐Dimensional (IDA3D), an ionospheric objective analysis algorithm. IDA3D uses a three‐dimensional variational data assimilation technique (3DVAR), similar to those used in meteorology. IDA3D incorporates available data, the associated data error covariances, a reasonable background specification, and the expected background error covariance into a coherent specification on a global grid. It is capable of incorporating most electron density related measurements including GPS‐TEC measurements, low‐Earth‐orbiting “beacon” TEC, and electron density measurements from radars and satellites. At present, the background specification is based upon empirical ionospheric models, but IDA3D is capable of using any global ionospheric specification as a background. In its basic form, IDA3D produces a spatial analysis of the electron density distribution at a specified time. A time series of these specifications can be created using past specifications to determine the background for the current analysis. IDA3D specifications are able to reproduce dynamic features of electron density, including the movement of the auroral boundary and the strength of the trough region.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2003JA010234",""

The drug is a potent inducer of apoptosis in various types of tumor cells, whereas it is nonapoptotic in normal cells. This study defined molecular responses to irofulven involving mitochondrial dysfunction and leading to death of prostate tumor LNCaP-Pro5 cells. Irofulven caused early (2–5 hours) translocation of the proapoptotic Bax from cytosol to mitochondria followed by the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release at 4 to 12 hours. These effects preceded caspase activation and during the first 6 hours were not affected by caspase inhibitors. Processing of caspase-9 initiated the caspase cascade at ∼6 hours and progressed over time. The activation of the caspase cascade provided a positive feedback loop that enhanced Bcl-2-independent translocation and cytochrome c release. General and specific caspase inhibitors abrogated irofulven-induced apoptotic DNA fragmentation with the following order of potency: pan-caspase ≥ caspase-9 &gt; caspase-8/6 &gt; caspase-2 &gt; caspase-3/7 &gt; caspase-1/4. Abrogation of caspase-mediated DNA fragmentation failed to salvage irofulven-treated cells from growth inhibition and loss of viability, demonstrating a substantial contribution of a caspase-independent cell death. Monobromobimane, an inhibitor of alternative caspase-independent apoptotic pathway that is mediated by mitochondrial permeability transition, antagonized both apoptosis, measured as phosphatidylserine externalization, and cytotoxicity of irofulven. Collectively, the results indicate that irofulven-induced signaling is integrated at the level of mitochondrial dysfunction. The induction of both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent death pathways is consistent with pleiotropic effects of irofulven, which include targeting of cellular DNA and proteins.","https://aacrjournals.org/mct/article-pdf/3/11/1385/1867104/1385-1396.pdf",""

This phenomenon is called meiotic silencing and on the basis of genetic studies appears to be a post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) mechanism. Previously, meiotic silencing was defined to be induced by the presence of a DNA region lacking an identical segment in the homologous chromosome. However, the determinants of unpaired DNA remained a mystery. Using the Ascospore maturation-1 (Asm-1) gene, we defined what needs to be “unpaired” to silence a gene. For efficient silencing, an unpaired region of DNA needs to be of a sufficient size and contain homology to the reporter transcript. The greater the size of the loop and the larger the homology to the reporter transcript, the better the resulting meiotic silencing is. Conversely, regions not containing homology to the transcript, e.g., intergenic regions, did not silence the reporter. Surprisingly, unpaired fragments lacking a canonical promoter silenced the reporter. Additionally, we detected the unpairing-dependent loss of a transcript during meiotic silencing. Our observations further support a PTGS mechanism for meiotic silencing and offer insight into the evolutionary consequences resulting from this novel meiotic checkpoint.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/167/1/131/42059464/genetics0131.pdf",""

The advantage of this approach is that the coefficient of nonlinearity for shear waves depends on only three elastic constants, one each at second, third, and fourth order, and these coefficients have comparable numerical values. In contrast, previous formulations yield coefficients of nonlinearity that depend on elastic constants whose values may differ by many orders of magnitude because they account for effects of compressibility as well as shear.

In each case the measured absorption exceeds the calculations substantially at most frequencies. We present the excess absorption spectra, that is the difference of the measured and the calculated profiles, of these supramolecular CH4–X systems at various gas temperatures. The excess absorption spectra of CH4–X pairs differ significantly for each choice of the collision partner X, but show common features (spectral intensities and shape) at frequencies from roughly 200 to 500 cm−1. These excess spectra seem to defy modeling in terms of ad hoc exchange force–induced dipole components attempted earlier. We suggest that besides the dipole components induced by polarization in the electric molecular multipole fields and their gradients, and by exchange and dispersion forces, other dipole induction mechanisms exist in CH4–X complexes that presumably are related to collisional distortion of the CH4 molecular frame.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.1829055/10871011/024301_1_online.pdf",""

However, whether intramyocardial lipid deposition is a feature of human heart failure remains to be established. We hypothesized that intramyocardial lipid accumulation is a common feature of non‐ischemic heart failure and is associated with changes in gene expression similar to those found in an animal model of lipotoxicity. Intramyocardial lipid staining with oil red O and gene expression analysis was performed on heart tissue from 27 patients (9 female) with non‐ischemic heart failure. We determined intramyocardial lipid, gene expression, and contractile function in hearts from 6 Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) and 6 Zucker lean (ZL) rats. Intramyocardial lipid overload was present in 30% of non‐ischemic failing hearts. The highest levels of lipid staining were observed in patients with diabetes and obesity (BMI>30). Intramyocardial lipid deposition was associated with an up‐regulation of peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor a (PPARα) ‐regulated genes, myosin heavy chain β (MHC‐β), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF‐α). Intramyocardial lipid overload in the hearts of ZDF rats was associated with contractile dysfunction and changes in gene expression similar to changes found in failing human hearts with lipid overload. Our findings identify a subgroup of patients with heart failure and severe metabolic dysregulation characterized by intramyocardial triglyceride overload and changes in gene expression that are associated with contractile dysfunction.—Sharma, S., Adrogue, J.

Results:: EV-HPV DNA was detected in all 41 skin lesions of the patients and was also identified in specimens considered as normal skin from 8 patients (40%). In this study HPV-EV 25 was the most prevalent (70%), and HPV 14d (67%) was highly associated with malignant lesions. Conclusion:: EV-HPV 25 was the most prevalent in our study. The noteworthy association of EV-HPV type 14d with skin cancers suggests its possible oncogenic role in malignant transformation in this population.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/120347540400800206",""

Chromosomes were segmented by γ-irradiation of G. hirsutum (n = 26) pollen, and segmented chromosomes were rescued after in vivo fertilization of G. barbadense egg cells (n = 26). A 5-krad γ-ray WWRH mapping panel (N = 93) was constructed and genotyped at 102 SSR loci. SSR marker retention frequencies were higher than those for animal systems and marker retention patterns were informative. Using the program RHMAP, 52 of 102 SSR markers were mapped into 16 syntenic groups. Linkage group 9 (LG 9) SSR markers BNL0625 and BNL2805 had been colocalized by linkage analysis, but their order was resolved by differential retention among WWRH plants. Two linkage groups, LG 13 and LG 9, were combined into one syntenic group, and the chromosome 1 linkage group marker BNL4053 was reassigned to chromosome 9. Analyses of cytogenetic stocks supported synteny of LG 9 and LG 13 and localized them to the short arm of chromosome 17. They also supported reassignment of marker BNL4053 to the long arm of chromosome 9. A WWRH map of the syntenic group composed of linkage groups 9 and 13 was constructed by maximum-likelihood analysis under the general retention model. The results demonstrate not only the feasibility of WWRH panel construction and mapping, but also complementarity to traditional linkage mapping and cytogenetic methods.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/167/3/1317/42062500/genetics1317.pdf",""

We employ analytical solutions, 3D finite‐difference time‐domain modeling, and field measurements of multipolarization GPR data to investigate EM wave transmission through fractured geologic formations. For surface‐based multipolarization GPR measurements across vertical fractures, we observe a phase lead when the incident electric‐field component is oriented perpendicular to the plane of the fracture. This observation is consistent for nonmagnetic geologic environments and allows the determination of vertical fracture location and azimuth based on the presence of a phase difference and a phase lead relationship between varying polarization GPR data.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/1.1759466",""

However, despite many desirable properties, the polymerization of acrylates via radical chain propagation causes some potential issues in the SFIL process as a result of the inhibition of these processes by oxygen. Vinyl ethers are prime candidates to replace acrylates. Their curing proceeds by a cationic mechanism, which is insensitive to oxygen and very rapid, while the vinyl ether group contribution to viscosity is significantly lower than that of an acrylate, silicon-containing vinyl ethers are not widely commercially available, and so were synthesized for this study. As expected, formulations based on these vinyl ethers were lower viscosity and faster curing than the acrylate etch barrier formulations presently employed, while the tensile strength of cured vinyl ether formulations were found to be higher than their acrylate counterparts. In spite of about twice higher template separation force compared with acrylates, the tensile strength of vinyl ether etch barrier formulations is about five times higher than that of acrylate formulations. Therefore, these vinyl ether-based formulations were used to pattern down to 50 nm features using the SFIL process.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-pdf/22/1/131/11022047/131_1_online.pdf",""

The current study has used a proteomic approach of two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (MS) to identify differentially expressed proteins in six cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, two normal adjacent tissues, seven cases of pancreatitis, and six normal pancreatic tissues. Protein extracts of individual sample and pooled samples of each type of tissues were separated on 2D gels using two different pH ranges. Differentially expressed protein spots were in-gel digested and identified by MS. Forty proteins were identified, of which five [i.e., α-amylase; copper zinc superoxide dismutase; protein disulfide isomerase, pancreatic; tropomyosin 2 (TM2); and galectin-1] had been associated previously with pancreatic disease in gene expression studies. The identified proteins include antioxidant enzymes, chaperones and/or chaperone-like proteins, calcium-binding proteins, proteases, signal transduction proteins, and extracellular matrix proteins. Among these proteins, annexin A4, cyclophilin A, cathepsin D, galectin-1, 14–3-3ζ, α-enolase, peroxiredoxin I, TM2, and S100A8 were specifically overexpressed in tumors compared with normal and pancreatitis tissues. Differential expression of some of the identified proteins was further confirmed by Western blot analyses and/or immunohistochemical analysis. These results show the value of a proteomic approach in identifying potential markers for early diagnosis and therapeutic manipulation. The newly identified proteins in pancreatic tumors may eventually serve as diagnostic markers or therapeutic targets.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/64/24/9018/2521594/zch02404009018.pdf",""

Because several characteristics of the oldest granule cells are adult-like on day 7, we re-examined the possibility of eliciting LTP in 7-day-old rats in vivo. We also recorded from 8- and 9-day-old rats to further elucidate the occurrence and magnitude of LTP in neonates. With halothane anesthesia, all animals in each age group exhibited synaptic plasticity of the excitatory postsynaptic potential following high-frequency stimulation of the MPP. In 7-day-old rats, LTP was elicited in 40% of the animals and had an average magnitude of 143%. Long-term depression (LTD) alone (magnitude of 84%) was induced in 40% of the animals, while short-term potentiation (STP) alone (magnitude of 123%) was induced in 10%.

Intron aI1 transposes in haploid cells at low frequency to target sites in mtDNA that resemble the exon 1-exon 2 (E1/E2) homing site. This study investigates a system in which aI1 can transpose in crosses (i.e., in trans). Surprisingly, replacing an inefficient transposition site with an active E1/E2 site supports &lt;1% transposition of aI1. Instead, the ectopic site was mainly converted to the related sequence in donor mtDNA in a process we call “abortive transposition.” Efficient abortive events depend on sequences in both E1 and E2, suggesting that most events result from cleavage of the target site by the intron RNP particles, gapping, and recombinational repair using homologous sequences in donor mtDNA. A donor strain that lacks RT activity carries out little abortive transposition, indicating that cDNA synthesis actually promotes abortive events. We also infer that some intermediates abort by ejecting the intron RNA from the DNA target by forward splicing. These experiments provide new insights to group II intron transposition and homing mechanisms in yeast mitochondria.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/168/1/77/42214951/genetics0077.pdf",""

Over 1200 adult volunteers evaluated a randomly assigned scenario describing a grandparent raising a grandchild, where scenarios varied in terms of grandchild gender, grandparent ethnicity, the presence/absence of grandchild problems, and the reason for the assumption of the grandparent caregiving role. Subjects rated scenarios according to the extent to which they thought the custodial grandparent was experiencing a variety of losses. Overall, perceptions of loss were greater for grandmothers whose grandchild was experiencing an emotional/ behavioral problem, and for those grandmothers whose grandchild had been abandoned or abused, or whose adult child had died, been incarcerated, or abused drugs. Due to an interaction between ethnicity and reason for role assumption, however, those findings are best interpreted in the context of the ethnicity of the grandparent. Depending on the context, respondents were less sensitive to losses suffered by Hispanic, African American, or Caucasian grandmothers. These data suggest that ethnicity of the grandparent and reason for assuming the custodial role affect the degree to which people are sensitive to the losses that custodial grandparents experience. These differences are likely to affect the extent to which others publicly acknowledge the grief of custodial grandparents. Moreover, ethnic stereotypes may interfere with an equitable allocation of social support for, and services to, grandparent caregivers. In this light, researchers should continue to study these disparities, as they are likely to affect the adjustment of grandparents to the custodial role.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2190/ARUD-1PJD-MBJY-N76N",""

There are conflicting reports on the status of hepatocyte regeneration following chronic alcohol ingestion. Hence, the objective of this study was to investigate the temporal dynamics between the pattern of liver injury and hepatocyte proliferation during the steatosis stage of ALD. Alcoholic steatosis was induced in male Sprague—Dawley rats by feeding an ethanol (EtOH)-containing Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet for a period of 5 weeks. Microvesicular steatosis was evident in H&E sections by three weeks in the EtOH-treated rats, which further developed into panlobular macrovesicular steatosis by 5 weeks. Plasma transaminase activities indicated progressive increase in liver injury peaking at 3 weeks with significant but mild decrease at 4 and 5 weeks. CYP2E1 protein and activity was significantly increased in EtOH-fed rats as measured by Western blot and pNP hydroxylation assay. PCNA analysis of liver sections indicated that EtOH-treated rats had a significantly higher number of cells in S phase of cell division at weeks 1 (3.20 ± 0.19), 2 (7.03 ± 0.92), and 3 (4.23 ± 1.41) when compared to controls (1.5 ± 0.22).

Secondly, it could be instrumental to enhance gas and condensate recovery. Using the pressure-temperature diagrams and two phase flash calculations, the phase behavior of natural gas-carbon dioxide mixtures were analyzed to provide enlightenment on the sequestration process. From analysis of simulated results, it was found that carbon dioxide exhibited a drying effect on wet and retrograde gas mixtures and a wetting effect on dry gas. The results for retrograde gas condensate depended on the composition of reservoir fluids at abandonment conditions. The main difference being the liquid volume present with increasing pressure and carbon dioxide concentration. This influenced the volume of condensate vaporized with addition of carbon dioxide. It was also determined that carbon dioxide lowers the compressibility factor of all gas types. These results are favorable for carbon dioxide sequestration because decreasing compressibility factors represents increasing storage capacity.","https://onepetro.org/SPEIOR/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/89345-MS/2885013/spe-89345-ms.pdf",""

TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a member of the TNF ligand family and can induce caspase-dependent apoptosis in cancer cells while sparing most of the normal cells. However, some of the cancer cell lines are insensitive to TRAIL, and such resistance cannot be explained by the dysfunction of TRAIL receptors or their known downstream targets. We reported previously that DAP kinase promoter is frequently methylated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and such methylation is associated with a poor clinical outcome. To determine whether DAP kinase promoter methylation contributes to TRAIL resistance in NSCLC cells, we measured DAP kinase promoter methylation and its gene expression status in 11 NSCLC cell lines and correlated the methylation/expression status with the sensitivity of cells to TRAIL. Of the 11 cell lines, 1 had a completely methylated DAP kinase promoter and no detectable DAP kinase expression, 4 exhibited partial promoter methylation and substantially decreased gene expression, and the other 6 cell lines showed no methylation in the promoter and normal DAP kinase expression. Therefore, the amount of DAP kinase expression amount was negatively correlated to its promoter methylation (r = −0.77; P = 0.003). Interestingly, the cell lines without the DAP kinase promoter methylation underwent substantial apoptosis even in the low doses of TRAIL, whereas those with DAP kinase promoter methylation were resistant to the treatment. The resistance to TRAIL was reciprocally correlated to DAP kinase expression in 10 of the 11 cell lines at 10 ng/mL concentration (r = 0.91; P = 0.001). We treated cells resistant to TRAIL with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, a demethylating reagent, and found that these cells expressed DAP kinase and became sensitive to TRAIL. These results suggest that DAP kinase is involved in TRAIL-mediated cell apoptosis and that a demethylating agent may have a role in enhancing TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in some NSCLC cells by reactivation of DAP kinase.","https://aacrjournals.org/mcr/article-pdf/2/12/685/3136252/685-691.pdf",""

Displays based on the principles of field emission have been regarded as a technology with a potential of replacing cathode ray tubes (CRTs) and liquid crystal displays. A field-emission display (FED) combines the best performance of a CRT in a configuration of a FPD because a FED offers high-power efficiency, high brightness and resolution, wide viewing angles, light weight, tolerance to temperature changes, and instant-on operation. However, commercial application of FEDs has been delayed because of the complex submicron processing involved in the fabrication of microtips for the cathode, early failure of cathodes due to sputter damage from uncontrolled emission current or current runoff, nonavailability of blue phosphors operating in low-voltage regimes, and lack of optimum sealing conditions. This article summarizes the development of a monochromatic monolithic thin-film edge emitter (MT-FEE) device while implementing a thin-film blue-light-emitting phosphor of zinc oxide and tungsten (ZnO:W). The device design reported here overcomes some of the above mentioned drawbacks of conventional FED designs. Performance of the MT-FEE devices was judged by controlling key parameters associated with the technology. Several test structures were fabricated by varying the dielectric, separating anode and cathode lines, in a range of 3–6 μm with emitter configurations as either saw-tooth or rectangular wedges to establish performance of the devices. Stable emission current of an approximate value of 200 nA per pixel was obtained at 300 V for 3 μm devices. Blue light was visible to the naked eye from several excited pixels in the 3 μm devices at voltages as low as 270 V.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-pdf/22/1/165/11023362/165_1_online.pdf",""

Stationary gratings were flashed on for 200 ms and then off for 300 ms; the responses were analyzed at sequential 1-ms intervals. We found that 1) the preferred spatial frequency shifts through time from low frequencies to high frequencies, 2) the latency of the response increases as a function of spatial frequency, and 3) the poststimulus time histograms (PSTHs) are relatively shape-invariant across spatial frequency. The dynamic shifts in preferred spatial frequency appear to be a simple consequence of the latency shifts and the transient nature of the PSTH. The effects of these dynamic shifts on the coding of spatial frequency information are examined within the context of several different temporal integration strategies, and pattern-detection performance is determined as a function of the interval of integration, following response onset. The findings are considered within the context of related investigations as well as a number of functional issues: motion selectivity in depth, “coarse-to-fine” processing, direction selectivity, latency as a code for stimulus attributes, and behavioral response latency. Finally, we demonstrate that the results are qualitatively consistent with a simple feedforward model, similar to the one originally proposed in 1962 by Hubel and Wiesel, that incorporates measured differences in the response latencies and the receptive field sizes of different lateral geniculate nucleus inputs.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jn.00858.2003",""

Many of them are highly polymorphic; they have been used widely in genetic studies. Statistical properties of all measures of genetic variation at microsatellites critically depend upon the composite parameter θ = 4Nμ, where N is the effective population size and μ is mutation rate per locus per generation. Since mutation leads to expansion or contraction of a repeat number in a stepwise fashion, the stepwise mutation model has been widely used to study the dynamics of these loci. We developed an estimator of θ, θ^F, on the basis of sample homozygosity under the single-step stepwise mutation model. The estimator is unbiased and is much more efficient than the variance-based estimator under the single-step stepwise mutation model. It also has smaller bias and mean square error (MSE) than the variance-based estimator when the mutation follows the multistep generalized stepwise mutation model. Compared with the maximum-likelihood estimator θ^L by Nielsen (1997), θ^F has less bias and smaller MSE in general. θ^L has a slight advantage when θ is small, but in such a situation the bias in θ^L may be more of a concern.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/166/1/555/42061900/genetics0555.pdf",""

The water propagation is approximately separated from the seabed interaction using predetermined bathymetry and a possibly range-dependent water sound speed profile. The geometrical optics approximation is used to calculate eigenrays between sources and receivers, including bottom reflecting paths. Modeled broadband pressure fields are obtained by computing the plane wave reflection coefficient at specific angles and frequencies and by then linking this result with the bottom reflected eigenrays. Each perturbation of the seabed requires a recalculation of the plane wave reflection coefficient, but not a recalculation of the eigenrays, resulting in a highly efficient method. Range-independent problems are treated as a limiting case of the approach. The method is first described and then demonstrated with a few simple range-independent theoretical models. The versatility of addressing range-dependence in the bottom seabed is demonstrated with a simulated data set. Finally, the new model is applied to inversion from a measured data set, taken with impulsive sources, for both range-independent and range-dependent continental shelf environments.","https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article-pdf/115/3/1078/12226325/1078_1_online.pdf",""

Proline-, glutamic acid-, and leucine-rich protein 1 (PELP1), also called modulator of nongenomic activity of estrogen receptor (MNAR), a novel coactivator of estrogen receptor, modulates estrogen receptor transactivation functions. The mechanisms by which PELP1 modulates estrogen receptor genomic functions is not known. Here, using biochemical and scanning confocal microscopic analysis, we have demonstrated nuclear localization and functional implications of PELP1. Subnuclear fractionation showed PELP1 association with chromatin and nuclear matrix fractions. Ligand stimulation promoted recruitment of PELP1 to 17β-estradiol responsive promoters, its colocalization with acetylated H3, and increased PELP1-associated histone acetyltransferase enzymatic activity. Far Western analysis revealed that PELP1 interacts with histone 1 and 3, with more preference toward histone 1. Using deletion analysis, we have identified the PELP1 COOH-terminal region as the histone 1 binding site. The PELP1 mutant lacking histone 1-binding domain acts as a dominant-negative and blocks estrogen receptor α-mediated transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed a cyclic association and dissociation of PELP1 with the promoter, with recruitment of histone 1 and PELP1 occurring in opposite phases. PELP1 overexpression increased the micrococcal nuclease sensitivity of estrogen response element-containing nucleosomes. Our results provide novel insights about the transcription regulation of PELP1 and suggest that PELP1 participates in chromatin remodeling activity via displacement of histone 1 in cancer cells.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/64/18/6416/2519040/zch01804006416.pdf",""

In this paper, we consider scheduling of operations in a bufferless dual-gripper robotic cell processing multiple part types. The processing constraints specify the cell to be a flowshop. The objective is to determine the robot move sequence and the sequence in which parts are to be processed so as to maximize the long-run average throughput rate for repetitive production of parts. We provide a framework to study the problem, and address the issues of problem complexity and solvability. Focusing on a particular class of robot move sequences, we identify all potentially optimal robot move sequences for the part-sequencing problem in a two-machine dual-gripper robot cell. In the case when the gripper switching time is sufficiently small, we specify the best robot move sequence in the class. We prove the problem of finding an optimal part sequence to be strongly NP-hard, even when the robot move sequence is specified. We provide a heuristic approach to solve the general two-machine problem and evaluate its performance on the set of randomly generated problem instances. We perform computations to estimate the productivity gain of using a dual-gripper robot in place of a single-gripper robot. Finally, we extend our results for the two-machine cell to solve an m-machine problem.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/opre.1030.0073",""

To study the role of CSF-1 or its receptor in initiation of mammary tumorigenesis, we have generated two independent lines of transgenic mice that overexpress either CSF-1 or c-fms under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter. Mammary glands of the virgin CSF-1 transgenic mice show increased ductal branching, hyperplasia, dysplasia, and other preneoplastic changes, which are indicative of increased cellular proliferation. Similar changes were also evident in the mammary glands of the c-fms transgenic mice. These changes became more prominent with age and resulted in mammary tumor formation. Moreover, secondary events like dimethylbenz(a)anthracene treatment accelerated mammary tumor formation in these mice. Although the expression of estrogen receptor α was not significantly changed in either of the transgenic mouse strains, progesterone receptor levels was higher in both transgenic lines as compared with the nontransgenic littermates. Expression of G1 cyclins was prominently increased in the mammary glands of both the CSF-1 and c-fms transgenic lines, suggesting increased cell cycle progression in these strains. In addition, the proliferation marker proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and the mitogen-responsive transcription factor c-jun were also increased as compared with the nontransgenic controls. These findings, along with the histological data, support the hypothesis that CSF-1 and its receptor are involved in the etiology of breast cancer.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/64/12/4162/2515322/zch01204004162.pdf",""

Efforts to limit this morbidity with radiosurgical techniques have not been feasible for infants because of the dual requirements of rigid head fixation and high precision. We report the radiosurgical treatment of five infants by use of a robotically controlled system without rigid head fixation. METHODS:: Five infants with malignant brain tumors received radiosurgical treatment with a robotically driven linear accelerator. Immobilization was aided by general anesthesia, form-fitting head supports, face masks, and body molds. The average marginal dose was 17 ± 2 Gy, and the average treatment volume was 18 ± 22 ml. RESULTS:: X-rays obtained during treatment revealed acceptable agreement with preoperative computed tomographic scans in all patients. In one patient, the lesion did not progress, but a distant recurrence occurred 15 months after radiosurgery and also was treated with radiosurgery. In another patient, tumor in the treated region did not progress, but recurrence elsewhere led to death 7 months after treatment. Tumor enlargement occurred in Patient 3 at 3 months posttreatment, leading to death 2 months later. Tumor size was smaller in the remaining two patients at 9 and 11 months after treatment. There has been no toxicity attributed to treatment. CONCLUSION:: Radiosurgery with minimal toxicity can be delivered to infants by use of a robotically controlled system that does not require rigid fixation. A formal dose-escalation trial is under way to address dose and toxicity for infants more thoroughly.","http://academic.oup.com/neurosurgery/article-pdf/55/4/916/32573595/00006123-200410000-00026.pdf",""

To accomplish this task we extend the concept of differential expression of the genes, widely used in gene expression data analysis, to genetic networks. We propose a definition for the differential expression of a genetic network and use the generalized T  2 statistic to measure the ability of genetic networks to distinguish different phenotypes. However, describing the differential expression of genetic networks is not enough for understanding biological systems because differences in the expression of genetic networks do not directly reflect regulatory strength between gene activities. Therefore, in this report we also introduce the concept of differentially regulated genetic networks, which has the potential to assess changes of gene regulation in response to perturbation in the environment and may provide new insights into the mechanism of diseases and biological processes. We propose five novel statistics to measure the differences in regulation of genetic networks. To illustrate the concepts and methods for reconstruction of genetic networks and identification of association of genetic networks with function, we applied the proposed models and algorithms to three data sets.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/166/2/1037/42059412/genetics1037.pdf",""

Computed tomography (CT) image data sets were acquired for 10 patients diagnosed with primary bronchogenic carcinoma. Data sets were acquired during free breathing, during breath‐holds at 0% tidal volume and 100% tidal volume, and, when possible, at deep inspiration corresponding to approximately 60% vital capacity. Two treatment plans were developed on the basis of each of the gated data sets: one in which the treatment portals were those of the free‐breathing plan, and the other in which the treatment portals were based on the gated planning target volumes. Dose‐mass histograms of the lungs calculated at 0% tidal volume were compared to those calculated at deep inspiration and at 100% tidal volume. Data extracted from the dose‐mass histograms were used to determine the most dosimetrically beneficial point to gate, the reduction in the amount of irradiated lung tissue that resulted from gating, and any disease characteristics that might predict a greater need for gating. The data showed a reduction in the mass of normal tissue irradiated when treatment portals based on the gated planning target volume were used. More normal lung tissue was spared at deep inspiration than at the other two gating points for all patients, but normal lung tissue was spared at every point in the respiratory cycle. No significant differences in the amount of irradiated tissue by disease characteristic were identified.

Degree error relative to measurement error increased by a factor of ∼20 due to atmospheric aliasing (corresponding to geoid anomalies of approximately 1 mm at 500 km wavelengths), by a factor of ∼10 due to the ocean model, and by a factor of ∼3 due to the continental hydrology model. De‐aliasing done with approximate models gave the greatest reduction in aliasing error for the mid‐degrees and higher.

We implement an experimental methodology and corresponding model of crystallization kinetics to decouple growth from nucleation and quantify the temperature dependence and absolute rates of both processes. Nucleation rates are found to increase from ∼3×1013 m−3 s−1 at 134 K to ∼2×1017 m−3 s−1 at 142 K, corresponding to an Arrhenius activation energy of 168 kJ/mol. Over the same temperature range, the growth velocity increases from ∼0.4 to ∼4 Å s−1, also exhibiting Arrhenius behavior with an activation energy of 47 kJ/mol. These nucleation rates are up to ten orders of magnitude larger than in liquid water near 235 K, while growth velocities are ≈109 times smaller.

We focus on the decay of the thermally averaged nuclear overlap/phase function (NOPF). Considering the strong coupling/high temperature limit, a relationship is obtained at short time between the rate of electronic coherence loss and the electronic dephasing rate characteristic of a classical bath. Using this relationship, we clarify the origin of the decay of the NOPF. In the same limit, we also reproduce an earlier relationship between the electronic decoherence time and a solvation relaxation time. Finally, we point out that, for the spin-boson model, the exact quantum mechanical description of electronic dephasing is reproduced by mixed quantum/classical methods if a Gaussian distribution of quantum fluctuations around each classical phase space point is introduced. That spatial distribution of quantum fluctuations is functionally the same as that appearing in the Feynman–Kleinert variational local harmonic approximation, and also that implemented in existing classical trajectory-based estimates of coherence dissipation times.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/120/24/11380/19203592/11380_1_online.pdf",""

Recent studies suggest that p53 is able to bind DNA with certain structural alterations in a sequence-independent manner and to interact with several molecules involved in DNA repair. This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that p53 may participate in sensing oxidative DNA damage, the most frequently occurring spontaneous DNA lesion, and modulate its repair by the base excision repair (BER) machinery. Using synthetic DNA containing 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-oxoG), we showed that p53 was pulled down together with two BER proteins, human 8-oxoguanine glycosylase (hOGG1) and AP endonuclease (APE). Functional analysis showed that p53 significantly enhanced the sequential activities of hOGG1 and APE in excising the 8-oxoG nucleotide from DNA in vitro. The ability of p53 to enhance the removal of oxidized DNA bases was further demonstrated in vivo using a pair of p53 isogenic lines. HCT116 p53+/+ cells exhibit a more rapid removal of 8-oxoG from DNA than p53−/− cells exposed to the same levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress. Together, these results suggest that p53 participates in sensing oxidative DNA damage and modulates BER function in response to persistent ROS stress.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/64/17/6233/2517929/zch01704006233.pdf",""

The system involves a solid sample immersed in a liquid pressure medium, both of which have unknown thermal properties. The temperature (T) and P dependance of κl are first determined through the use of a modified 3ω technique. This method uses a conducting wire (Pt, in this work), which is immersed in the pressure medium, as the heater/sensor. In addition to κl, this allows for the accurate determination of the specific heat per volume of the liquid and Pt, (ρC)l and (ρC)Pt, respectively. The information of κl and (ρC)l can then be used to make corrections to measurements of κs, in which the sample is immersed in the pressure medium, and a metal strip acts as the heater/sensor.

Vortex pattern emergence and evolution were evaluated, and conditions for flow stability were delineated. Systolic flow was found to be forward-directed throughout the bulge in all the models, regardless of size. Vortices appeared in the bulge initially during deceleration from systole, then expanded during the retrograde flow phase. The complexity of the vortex field depended strongly on bulge diameter. In every model, the maximum shear stress occurred at peak systole at the distal bulge end, with the greatest shear stress developing in a model corresponding to a 4.3 cm AAA in vivo. Although the smallest models exhibited stable flow throughout the cycle, flow in the larger models became increasingly unstable as bulge size increased, with strong amplification of instability in the distal half of the bulge. These data suggest that larger aneurysms in vivo may be subject to more frequent and intense turbulence than smaller aneurysms.

A 23.8 mm × 3.4 mm × 0.16 mm IPMC strip was used as an actuator in a cantilever configuration. Open-loop force and position responses of an IPMC are not repeatable, and hence closed-loop precision control is of critical importance to ensure proper functioning, repeat-ability and reliability. After feedback controllers were designed and implemented with empirically obtained fourth-order plant transfer functions, the overshoot decreased from 460 to 2.8 per cent and the settling time was reduced from 37.5 to 3.22 s in force control. In position control the overshoot decreased from 333 to 20.3 per cent and the settling time was reduced from 21.5 to 2.56 s. Microscale precision force and position control capabilities of the IPMC actuator were also demonstrated experimentally. An 8 μN force resolution was achieved with a force noise of 0.5μN r.m.s., and the position resolution was 6 μm with a position noise of 2.5 μm r.m.s. The maximum force and tip displacement achieved with the IPMC actuator under closed-loop control were 2 mN and 5 mm respectively. The IPMC actuator could follow various commanded force and position trajectories such as sinusoidal and trapezoidal position profiles, and a velocity profile with a 3 mm/s maximum velocity. A novel hybrid force and position control strategy demonstrated its utility in practical micromanipulalion applications where the actuator force must be limited to prevent damaging micro-objects. High-precision control of the IPMC at low force level proved its potential for micromanufacturing and micromanipulation applications such as robotic and biomedical microgrippers.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/095965180421800601",""

Quasiperiodic oscillations are rarely discussed in the neurophysiological literature yet they may play a role in the nervous system both during normal function and disease. Here we use a physical system and a model to explore scenarios for how quasiperiodic oscillations might arise in neuronal networks. An oscillatory system of two mutually inhibitory neuronal units is a ubiquitous network module found in nervous systems and is called a half-center oscillator. Previously we created a half-center oscillator of two identical oscillatory silicon (analog Very Large Scale Integration) neurons and developed a mathematical model describing its dynamics. In the mathematical model, we have shown that an in-phase limit cycle becomes unstable through a subcritical torus bifurcation. However, the existence of this torus bifurcation in experimental silicon two-neuron system was not rigorously demonstrated or investigated. Here we demonstrate the torus predicted by the model for the silicon implementation of a half-center oscillator using complex time series analysis, including bifurcation diagrams, mapping techniques, correlation functions, amplitude spectra, and correlation dimensions, and we investigate how the properties of the quasiperiodic oscillations depend on the strengths of coupling between the silicon neurons. The potential advantages and disadvantages of quasiperiodic oscillations (torus) for biological neural systems and artificial neural networks are discussed.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/cha/article-pdf/14/4/995/18303250/995_1_online.pdf",""

Independent lead-lag controllers have been used for the vertical control. The system equations have been derived using the Euler angle methodology and linearized about an operating point. The performance of this multivariable control has been analyzed and compared with all the six decoupled SISO controllers. The effect of adding the integrators to eliminate the steady-state error has also been discussed and the performance of the LQR controller with different weight matrices has been compared.

Although the weight-bearing and ambulatory demands on this joint predispose the ulcers to chronicity, recalcitrance to treatment in the absence of systemic factors may be indicative of the presence of less-than-optimal local factors mitigating against healing. In our experience, excessive skin tightness around the knee joint has played a key role in this respect. This retrospective study on 10 patients with 16 recalcitrant knee ulcers demonstrated the inadequacy of the traditional treatment approach of ulcer excision and grafting. However, incisional release of tight skin above the knee joint and resurfacing the defect with split-thickness skin graft (mean size, 118.26 ± 35.32 cm2) eliminated excessive tension and allowed the ulcers to heal spontaneously and permanently. We found this approach useful in select patients, and we are favorably disposed to additional releasing incision and grafting if the need arises in the growing child.","https://academic.oup.com/jbcr/article-pdf/25/1/129/23046878/00004630-200401000-00023.pdf",""

By using the prediction of system states and the event-driven and time-driven smart actuator simultaneously, the plant receives the current control signal in every sampling interval even at the presence of time delays and packet losses. Thus we can compensate the time-delay and packet-loss in a uniform way.

The channel aspect ratio is 2:1. Five different turbulators are studied: 45° angled ribs, V-shaped ribs, discrete 45° angled ribs, discrete V-shaped ribs, and crossed V-shaped ribs. The ribs are placed on the leading and trailing surfaces. The Reynolds numbers range from 5000 to 40000. The corresponding rotation numbers vary from 0.21 to 0.026 for a fixed rotating speed of 550 rpm. The rib height-to-hydraulic diameter ratio (e/D) is 0.094, the rib pitch-to-height ratio (P/e) is 10, and the inlet coolant-to-wall density ratio (Δρ/ρ) is maintained around 0.115. For each case, two channel orientations are studied, 90° and 135° with respect to the plane of rotation.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to one of six treatment groups: sedentary control (Con), Con with streptozocin (Stz/C), immediately postexercise (Ex0), Ex0 with Stz (Stz/Ex0), 5-h postexercise (Ex5), and Ex5 with Stz (Stz/Ex5). Rats were exercised by swimming (2 bouts of 3 h) and carbohydrate supplemented immediately after each exercise session by glucose intubation (1 ml of a 50% wt/vol). Stz was administered 72-h before exercise, which resulted in hyperglycemia and elimination of the insulin response to the carbohydrate supplement. GLUT-4 protein of Ex0 rats was 30% above Con in fast-twitch (FT) red and 21% above Con in FT white muscle. In Ex5, GLUT-4 protein was 52% above Con in FT red and 47% above Con in FT white muscle. Muscle glycogen in FT red and white muscle was also increased above Con in Ex5 rats. Neither GLUT-4 protein nor muscle glycogen was increased above Con in Stz/Ex0 or Stz/Ex5 rats.

Special challenges are posed by antimony segregation at the arsenide-on-antimonide interface, indium segregation at the antimonide-on-arsenide interface, and by the desire to selectively control the purity and types of interface bonds at either heterojunction. Here, we briefly review how cross-sectional scanning tunneling microscopy may be used to examine antimony and indium segregation with atomic-scale precision in type-II quantum wells, and then explain how such measurements suggest a unique structural interpretation for the residual strain exhibited by typical mid-IR semiconductor laser active regions in x-ray diffraction.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-pdf/22/3/1593/12226077/1593_1_online.pdf",""

The bearing models were represented as bond graphs. Currently, bond graphers view bearings as single-port resistance elements, which only account for losses associated with relative tangential motions between surfaces. Machine designers view bearings as devices that generate forces normal to surfaces in relative motion, to maintain position and alignment of shafts or surfaces. Both effects occur in real bearings, coupled together via physics. A lumped parameter model for hydrodynamically lubricated bearings is developed in this paper. The model includes the physical coupling between rotational degrees of freedom and orthogonal degrees of freedom associated with maintaining alignments. These lumped parameter models were synthesized from solutions of the Reynolds equation for various bearing geometries, and include normal motion and squeeze film effects. Since the forces, velocities and displacements pertaining to these orthogonal motions are physically coupled via viscous and constriction effects in the bearing's lubricant flow, the bond graph models involve resistive fields. Examples apply these concepts to thrust and journal bearings.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/095965180421800804",""

Cantaloupes ( Cucumis melo, L.) have become a product of interest due to the recent food-borne illness outbreaks related to their consumption in the United States and other countries. The main goal of this study was to verify whether treatment of cantaloupes using electron beam technology has any detrimental effects on the product quality. Whole and fresh-cut packaged cantaloupes were irradiated using a linear electron beam accelerator with the single beam (10MeV) fixture. Samples were stored at 10°C for zero, 4, 8 and 12 days along with control (non-irradiated) samples and tested for colour, texture (firmness), size (density), sugars and carotene content to determine the effect of irradiation dose level (1.0, 1.5 and 3.1kGy). Results indicated that irradiation of cantaloupes, as whole fruits with dose up to 1.0kGy, caused no significant changes on the fruit’s physical and nutritional quality attributes. Irradiating at higher doses had an undesirable effect on product quality. The fresh-cut packaged cantaloupe may be irradiated up to 1.5kGy without worsening the product quality attributes.

Better utilization of network resources can be achieved, however, if congestion management algorithms can determine when two different flows share a congested link. Such knowledge can be used to implement cooperative congestion control or improve the overlay topology of a P2P system. Previous techniques to detect shared congestion either assume a common source or destination node, drop-tail queueing, or a single point of congestion. We propose in this paper a novel technique, applicable to any pair of paths on the Internet, without such limitations. Our technique employs a signal processing method, wavelet denoising, to separate queueing delay caused by network congestion from various other delay variations. Our wavelet-based technique is evaluated through both simulations and Internet experiments. We show that, when detecting shared congestion of paths with a common endpoint, our technique provides faster convergence and higher accuracy while using fewer packets than previous techniques, and that it also accurately determines when there is no shared congestion. Furthermore, we show that our technique is robust and accurate for paths without a common endpoint or synchronized clocks; more specifically, it can tolerate a synchronization offset of up to one second between two packet flows.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1030194.1015500",""

Our hypothesis was that the measurements taken by computer-assisted methods of these three forefoot angles would be superior in consistency and accuracy compared to manual measurements. Methods:: Four examiners studied 20 weightbearing anteroposterior radiographs of patients with hallux valgus. Manual measurements were taken on photographic prints using a goniometer and a fine point pen. Computer-assisted measurements were taken on digitized images using computer software. Three sets of measurements by both of these methods were taken 1 week apart. Results:: There was no statistically significant difference between digital and manual measurements for any of the three angles measured ( p.05). However, the reliability of measurements within a range of 5 degrees for both methods was 70.6% for HVA, 84% for 1–2 IMA, and 59% for DMAA. Conclusion:: There were no significant differences in interobserver and intraobserver reliability in measuring 1–2 IMA and HVA, regardless of the method of measurement; however, there was a significant difference in interobserver reliability when measuring the DMAA either on computer or manually ( p = < .05).","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/107110070402501003",""

Recent literature describes an incidence ranging from 0.26% to 7.6%; higher incidence is seen in patients with active opportunistic infections or malignancy, and in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. A variety of potential mechanisms have been proposed to account for the observed hypercoagulability in HIV-infected patients. These include the presence of antiphospholipid-anticardiolipin antibodies, decreased activities of natural anticoagulants (especially protein S), and increased platelet activation. Recent epidemiological studies emphasize the increased incidence of thromboembolic events including myocardial infarction in the HIV-infected population after the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy. The use of protease inhibitors in particular is implicated. A hypercoagulable state and especially thromboses are emerging as clinical issues in HIV-infected patients.

A novel model predictive control strategy with optimal controller design is developed to overcome the adverse influences of time delays and packet losses. By using the prediction of system states and the event-driven and time-driven smart actuator simultaneously, the plant receives the current control signal in every sampling interval even at the presence of time delays and packet losses. Thus we can compensate the time-delay and packet-loss in a uniform way. The simulation and experimental results demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of this control algorithm for NCSs with long stochastic time delays and successive packet losses.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2004-61733/2620056/547_1.pdf",""

Special challenges are posed by antimony segregation at the arsenide-on-antimonide interface, indium segregation at the antimonide-on-arsenide interface, and by the desire to selectively control the purity and types of interface bonds at either heterojunction. Here, we briefly review how cross-sectional scanning tunneling microscopy may be used to examine antimony and indium segregation with atomic-scale precision in type-II quantum wells, and then explain how such measurements suggest a unique structural interpretation for the residual strain exhibited by typical mid-IR semiconductor laser active regions in x-ray diffraction.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-pdf/22/3/1593/12226077/1593_1_online.pdf",""

The goal of this project is to help managers of any park in California to identify and implement ITS solutions and themes that can help to address their park's specific transportation needs.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/1895-22",""

Its importance increases more, as the devices are of cutting edge technology with increasing complexity and decreasing dimensions. Global fail site isolations techniques (like XIVA, Photo Emission, FMI etc) and tester based techniques (using automatic test equipment, Fastscan etc) alone, are no longer sufficient and may not be successful. Long net lists and large fail sites isolated by these methods pose problems for physical failure analysis. Planarity of these large areas during parallel lap and inspection times using the SEM is difficult and tedious, thus leading to long cycle times and low resolution rates. There exists a need for precise fail site isolation. In many cases, no single technique can be used to narrow down a fail site significantly. Instead a combination of different techniques must be used. In this paper we present a case study, where a combination of complimentary techniques are used to successfully isolate a fail area of more than 1300 microns in length to less than 100 microns on a single failing net.","http://dl.asminternational.org/istfa/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.31399/asm.cp.istfa2004p0172/412259/istfa2004p0172.pdf",""

Cantaloupes ( Cucumis melo, L.) have become a product of interest due to the recent food-borne illness outbreaks related to their consumption in the United States and other countries. The main goal of this study was to verify whether treatment of cantaloupes using electron beam technology has any detrimental effects on the product quality. Whole and fresh-cut packaged cantaloupes were irradiated using a linear electron beam accelerator with the single beam (10MeV) fixture. Samples were stored at 10°C for zero, 4, 8 and 12 days along with control (non-irradiated) samples and tested for colour, texture (firmness), size (density), sugars and carotene content to determine the effect of irradiation dose level (1.0, 1.5 and 3.1kGy). Results indicated that irradiation of cantaloupes, as whole fruits with dose up to 1.0kGy, caused no significant changes on the fruit’s physical and nutritional quality attributes. Irradiating at higher doses had an undesirable effect on product quality. The fresh-cut packaged cantaloupe may be irradiated up to 1.5kGy without worsening the product quality attributes. In both cases, carotene content slightly increased as irradiation dose increased. In general, samples irradiated with dose levels between 1.0-1.5kGy had better quality attributes than the non-irradiated samples.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1082013204049385",""

Deregulation of the Rb-E2F1 pathway also results in the activation of p53 and the promotion of apoptosis, and this contributes to the suppression of tumor development. Here, we describe a novel connection between E2F1 and the ATM DNA damage response pathway. In primary human fibroblasts lacking functional ATM, the ability of E2F1 to induce the phosphorylation of p53 and apoptosis is impaired. In contrast, ATM status has no effect on transcriptional activation of target genes or the stimulation of DNA synthesis by E2F1. Cells containing mutant Nijmegen breakage syndrome protein (NBS1), a component of the Mre11-Rad50 DNA repair complex, also have attenuated p53 phosphorylation and apoptosis in response to E2F1 expression. Moreover, E2F1 induces ATM- and NBS1-dependent phosphorylation of the checkpoint kinase Chk2 at Thr68, a phosphorylation site that stimulates Chk2 activity. Delayed γH2AX phosphorylation and absence of ATM autophosphorylation at Ser1981 suggest that E2F1 stimulates ATM through a unique mechanism that is distinct from agents that cause DNA double-strand breaks. These findings identify new roles for several DNA damage response factors by demonstrating that they also participate in the oncogenic stress signaling pathway between E2F1 and p53.","https://aacrjournals.org/mcr/article-pdf/2/4/203/3137935/203-214.pdf",""

Patient data used as the basis for disease prognosis are usually censored because some of the patients have not experienced the outcome of the disease at the time of prognosis. A mathematical-programming approach, called isotonic prediction, is developed for the purpose of such prognosis tasks. The proposed technique is different from well-known statistical survival analysis methods, such as Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimation and Cox's regression, in that it predicts individual patients' survival time frame. Two medical applications are presented to show the applicability of the proposed isotonic prediction technique.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mnsc.1030.0137",""

We describe a systematic approach to quantify the effects of mud-filtrate invasion on borehole acoustic logs and introduce a novel algorithm to estimate radial distributions of elastic parameters away from the borehole wall. Radial saturation distributions of mud filtrate and connate formation fluids are obtained by simulating the process of mud-filtrate invasion. Subsequently, radial profiles of the elastic properties are calculated using the Biot-Gassmann fluid substitution model. Array waveforms are simulated using the calculated radial profiles of formation elastic parameters as input. Estimated compressional- and shear-wave velocities for homogeneous, stepwise, and multilayered formation model are compared to quantify mud-filtrate invasion.","https://onepetro.org/SPEATCE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/90159-MS/2871384/spe-90159-ms.pdf",""

This distributed selective re-execution (DSRE) protocol permits multiple speculative waves of computation to be traversing a dataflow graph simultaneously, with a commit wave propagating behind them to ensure correct execution. We evaluate one application of this protocol to provide efficient recovery for load-store dependence speculation.

The base total pressure for the UHV side is 1–3×10−10Torr. The partial pressure of individual gases that we are studying is &lt;10−10Torr. The sample to be measured is secured between the two chambers using two 2.75 conflat flanges, two copper gaskets, and two indium “O” rings.

Magnetic fluctuations called Pi2 geomagnetic pulsations are associated with bursty flows in the geotail plasma, where the plasma pressure exceeds the magnetic pressure. These strong magnetic fluctuations are often associated with substorms and start a few minutes before the arrival of the dipolarization pulse. Motivated by these observations, we have derived a nonlinear partial differential equation and developed an initial value code to investigate the firehose anisotropy‐driven turbulence in the Earth's geotail. We show that Hall MHD and dispersive ion kinetic effects limit the range of unstable parallel wavenumbers and determine the frequency spectrum of the turbulence. Nonlinear saturation is caused by the nonlinear weakening at large magnetic field line distortions of the destabilizing magnetic curvature force driven by the pressure anisotropy.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2003JA010288",""

Transfer of inventory monitoring and other overhead costs to manufacturers and continuous replenishment of retailer inventory are commonly cited as potential benefits that VMI offers to retailers. We provide a new explanation in this paper for why retailers might be interested in VMI. We show that VMI intensifies the competition between manufacturers of competing brands and that the increased competition benefits a retailer that stocks these brands. Competition arises because of brand substitution; that is, some consumers may switch to another brand if their “preferred” brand is out of stock. The manufacturer whose brand is out of stock thus risks losing sales from those consumers who buy the competing brand. Consequently, each manufacturer has an incentive to keep a higher stock of its own brand, not only to satisfy the demand from its customers, but also the spillover demand that arises if a competing brand goes out of stock. When the retailer makes the stocking-level decisions, the competition is mitigated by the pooling of demands at the retailer. VMI restores the competition between the manufacturers and benefits the retailer.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mnsc.1030.0174",""

The methodologies are part of an overall research effort to address the integrated operations of a diamond interchange and a ramp metering system. The methodologies were implemented in DRIVE, a computer model characterized as a mesoscopic simulation and analytical model. A meso-scopic model has the advantages of both macroscopic and microscopic models with less computing time while still considering stochastic traffic flows. DRIVE can be used to perform system analysis and evaluation of an integrated diamond interchange and ramp metering system over multiple cycles. The component concerning the diamond interchange operations is documented here, with a particular focus on the impact of potential queue spillback to the diamond interchange signals from ramp metering. The study focused on the two common diamond phasing schemes: basic three-phase and Texas Transportation Institute (TTI) four-phase. DRIVE was validated against the VISSIM microscopic traffic simulation model, and general agreement was found in the results between the two models. For oversaturated ramp conditions with queue spillback, both DRIVE and VISSIM indicated that TTI four-phase favors the frontage road approach, whereas the basic three-phase favors the arterial left-turn movement.

Studies show that high Akt activity in breast carcinoma is associated with a poor pathophenotype, as well as hormone and chemotherapy resistance. Additionally, high Akt activity is associated with other features of poor prognosis. Thus, a chemotherapeutic agent directed specifically toward tumors with high Akt activity could prove extremely potent in treating those breast tumors with the most aggressive phenotypes. Several studies have demonstrated that rapamycin, which inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a downstream target of Akt, sensitizes certain resistant cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents. This study evaluated the efficacy of mTOR inhibition in the treatment of tamoxifen-resistant breast carcinoma characterized by high Akt activity. We found that MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines expressing a constitutively active Akt are able to proliferate under reduced estrogen conditions and are resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of tamoxifen, both in vitro as well as in vivo in xenograft models. Cotreatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin in vitro, or the ester of rapamycin, CCI-779 (Wyeth) in vivo, inhibited mTOR activity and restored sensitivity to tamoxifen, suggesting that Akt-induced tamoxifen resistance is mediated in part by signaling through the mTOR pathway. Although the mechanism underlying the synergism remains to be understood, the results were associated with rapamycin’s ability to block transcriptional activity mediated by estrogen receptor α, as assessed by reporter gene assays with estrogen-responsive element luciferase. These data corroborate prior findings indicating that Akt activation induces resistance to tamoxifen in breast cancer cells. Importantly, these data indicate a novel mechanism for tamoxifen resistance and suggest that blockage of the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase/Akt signaling pathway by mTOR inhibition effectively restores the susceptibility of these cells to tamoxifen. These data may have implication for future clinical studies of mTOR inhibition in breast carcinoma.","https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article-pdf/10/23/8059/1955202/zdf02304008059.pdf",""

Transfer of inventory monitoring and other overhead costs to manufacturers and continuous replenishment of retailer inventory are commonly cited as potential benefits that VMI offers to retailers. We provide a new explanation in this paper for why retailers might be interested in VMI. We show that VMI intensifies the competition between manufacturers of competing brands and that the increased competition benefits a retailer that stocks these brands. Competition arises because of brand substitution; that is, some consumers may switch to another brand if their “preferred” brand is out of stock. The manufacturer whose brand is out of stock thus risks losing sales from those consumers who buy the competing brand. Consequently, each manufacturer has an incentive to keep a higher stock of its own brand, not only to satisfy the demand from its customers, but also the spillover demand that arises if a competing brand goes out of stock. When the retailer makes the stocking-level decisions, the competition is mitigated by the pooling of demands at the retailer. VMI restores the competition between the manufacturers and benefits the retailer.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mnsc.1030.0174",""

It has been proposed that Klar facilitates nuclear migration by linking the nucleus to the microtubule organizing center (MTOC). Here we perform genetic and immunohistochemical experiments that provide a critical test of this model. We analyze mutants in the endogenous klar gene and also flies that express deleted forms of Klar protein from transgenes. We find that the KASH domain of Klar is critical for perinuclear localization and for function. In addition, we find that the N-terminal portion of Klar is also important for function and contains a domain that localizes the protein to microtubules apical to the nucleus. These results provide strong support for a model in which Klar links the nucleus to the MTOC.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/168/3/1385/42221008/genetics1385.pdf",""

Both water‐and tissue‐equivalent phantoms include lung‐ and rib‐equivalent components. The phantoms simulate large, medium and small breasts. The value of the phantoms as breast treatment quality assurance tools was assessed by dose measurements with ionization chamber and thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLD) at different points inside the phantom. Measurements were made by irradiating the phantoms under conditions representing the different treatment techniques found by the Radiological Physics Center (RPC) during its dosimetry quality audits. Most irradiations were performed with the water‐equivalent breast phantom. One experiment was performed under consistent irradiation conditions to compare the tissue‐equivalent phantom with the water‐equivalent phantom. Measurements were compared with the dose estimated by the RPC's manual calculations used to check clinical charts of patients entered in a National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) protocol. Measurements were also compared with isodose distributions generated by a commercial radiation treatment planning (RTP) system. In the homogeneous three‐dimensional (3‐D) phantom, fairly good agreement (within 5%) was observed at the NSABP dose prescription point between measurements and 2‐D dose estimation by manual calculations. At the same dose prescription point, but located in the heterogeneous 3‐D phantom, agreement between measurements and a 3‐D RTP system was within about 3%. Manual calculation resulted in overestimation of up to 6%. The general agreement between the TLD measurements and the 2‐D RTP values was within 3% at various off‐axis points, with the exception of a few points far off‐axis, near the high‐dose gradient region at the surface of the phantom.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1120%2Fjacmp.v5i1.1992",""

Here we report that CPAF, synthesized as a 70-kDa proprotein, is processed into two fragments (designated CPAFn and CPAFc) to form intramolecular dimers that are much more stable than the naïve CPAF. Precipitation with antibodies that recognized CPAF dimers removed the proteolytic activity responsible for degrading host transcription factor RFX5 from chlamydia-infected host cell cytosol, while precipitation with antibodies that recognized free CPAF fragments alone did not remove this activity. Separation of CPAFn from CPAFc resulted in a loss of proteolytic activity. Furthermore, neither expressed full-length CPAF that was not processed nor coexpressed CPAFn and CPAFc fragments that failed to form dimers degraded RFX5. These observations demonstrate that intramolecular dimerization is required for CPAF to degrade host transcription factors, a strategy that is utilized by an obligate intracellular bacterial species to evade host defenses.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/IAI.72.7.3869-3875.2004",""

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of ZD6474, an inhibitor of inhibitor of VEGF receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase with additional activity against EGF receptor (EGFR), on tumor growth and angiogenesis in an orthotopic model of gastric cancer. In vitro, ZD6474 inhibited human umbilical vascular endothelial cell and TMK-1 human gastric tumor cell proliferation in a dose-dependent fashion. EGF-mediated activation of EGFR and Erk-1/2 was decreased in tumor cells after ZD6474 treatment. In addition, VEGF-mediated activation of VEGFR2 and Erk-1/2 was decreased in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells. TMK-1 human gastric adenocarcinoma cells were injected into the gastric wall of nude mice. ZD6474 therapy was initiated on day 10. Mice (n = 14 per group) were treated p.o. with (a) 1% Tween 80 (control), (b) 50 mg/kg/d ZD6474, or (c) 100 mg/kg/d ZD6474. Mice were sacrificed on day 33. Tumors from each group were stained for markers of blood vessels, pericytes, proliferation, and apoptosis. ZD6474 at both 50 and 100 mg/kg/d led to marked inhibition of tumor growth (P &lt; 0.05). ZD6474 reduced tumor cell proliferation by 48% in the 50 mg/kg/d group and 65% in the 100 mg/kg/d group (P &lt; 0.03) and increased tumor cell apoptosis (P &lt; 0.001) in vivo. ZD6474 led to a 69% decrease in microvessel density in the 50 mg/kg/d group (P &lt; 0.001) and a 62% decrease in the 100 mg/kg/d group (P &lt; 0.001). Although microvessel density was decreased by ZD6474, the remaining vessels showed a relatively higher percentage of pericyte coverage (3-fold increase; P &lt; 0.001), perhaps reflecting selective loss of uncovered vessels in the ZD6474 group. In conclusion, therapies such as ZD6474 that target two distinct aspects of tumor growth, angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation, warrant further investigation.","https://aacrjournals.org/mct/article-pdf/3/9/1041/1868711/1041-1048.pdf",""

Ten to 15% of sporadic colorectal cancers, however, will have MSI. Microsatellite unstable tumors can be divided into two distinct MSI phenotypes: MSI-high (MSI-H) and MSI-low (MSI-L). MSI sporadic colorectal cancers with a high level of MSI (MSI-H) form a well defined group with distinct clinicopathologic features characterized by an overall better long-term prognosis. These sporadic MSI-H colorectal tumors most often arise from the epigenetic silencing of the mismatch repair gene MLH1. In contrast, MSI-L colorectal tumors have not been shown to differ in their clinicopathologic features or in most molecular features from microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors. Unlike MSI-H tumors, MSI-L tumors appear to arise through the chromosomal instability carcinogenesis pathway, similar to MSS tumors. Some groups have reported more frequent mutations in K-ras and in the methylation of methylguanine transferase in MSI-L tumors, but others have questioned these findings. Therefore, although the use of the MSI-L category is widespread, there continues to be some debate as to whether a discrete MSI-L group truly exists. Rather, it has been suggested that MSI-L tumors differ quantitatively from MSS tumors but do not differ qualitatively. Future studies will need to evaluate the specific mutations in non-MSI-H tumors in an attempt to sub-classify MSI-L tumors with regard to MSS tumors so that subtle differences between these two sub-groups can be identified.","http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/dm/2004/368680.pdf",""

The American College of Toxicology has concluded that BKC can be safely used as an antimicrobial agent at concentrations up to 0.1%. BKC has been in clinical use since 1935 and is contained in a wide variety of prescription and over‐the‐counter products. However, over the past several years there have been conflicting reports of damage to human nasal epithelia and/or exacerbation of rhinitis medicamentosa associated with intranasal products containing BKC. OBJECTIVE: We sought to review the published literature and determine whether there is sufficient, clinically significant data that would confirm that intranasal products containing BKC are likely to damage human nasal epithelia or exacerbate rhinitis medicamentosa. METHODS: A literature search was conducted for in vivo and in vitro studies that evaluated the effects of BKC on human nasal epithelia. RESULTS: A total of 18 studies (14 in vivo, 4 in vitro) were identified that evaluated short‐ and long‐term exposure of concentrations of BKC in concentrations ranging from 0.00045% to 0.1%. Eight studies, including a 6‐month and 1‐year long‐term treatment study, demonstrated no toxic effects associated with BKC, indicating that BKC was neither harmful to nasal tissue nor prone to exacerbate rhinitis medicamentosa. Furthermore, of the 10 studies that concluded that BKC resulted in degenerative changes in human nasal epithelia (eg, ciliary beat frequency, ciliary morphology, mucociliary clearance, epithelial thinning and/or destruction) or that BKC exacerbates rhinitis medicamentosa, only 2 (it was 2 according to the Results section) of these studies were supported by statistically significant differences between BKC and placebo or active control groups were compared. It is important to note that in both of these studies, the protocol incorporated the use or oxymetazoline in some or all of the subjects. Oxymetazoline is associated with rhinitis medicamentosa. CONCLUSION: Intranasal products containing the preservative BKC appear to be safe and well tolerated for both long‐ and short‐term clinical use.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1016/j.otohns.2003.07.005",""

This paper discusses a novel, cost effective, wet chemical process that has been developed for thin die and lid removal of flip-chip packaged units. The process uses n-methy-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) for epoxy-based lid attach and underfill materials. A reflux unit is designed to reduce the risk of fire and explosion when the sample is heated in the solvent to the desired temperature. The method of heating reduces the chance of thermal shock, which could fracture the sample due to rapid heating or cooling.","http://dl.asminternational.org/istfa/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.31399/asm.cp.istfa2004p0633/412506/istfa2004p0633.pdf",""

Via Toll-like receptor 9 agonism of dendritic cells and B cells, CpG ODNs induce cytokines, activate natural killer cells, and elicit vigorous T-cell responses that lead to significant antitumor effects, including improved efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents. On the basis of these properties of CpG ODNs, we tested whether they also could enhance tumor response to radiotherapy. Using an immunogenic mouse tumor, designated FSa, the response to radiotherapy was assayed by tumor growth delay and tumor cure rate (TCD50, radiation dose yielding 50% tumor cure rate). Treatments were initiated when established tumors were either 6 or 8 mm in diameter. CpG ODN as a single agent given s.c. peritumorally had little effect on tumor growth; however, it dramatically enhanced tumor growth delay in response to single-dose radiation by a factor of 2.58–2.65. CpG ODN also dramatically improved tumor radiocurability, reducing the TCD50 by a factor of 1.93, from 39.6 (36.1–43.1) Gy to 20.5 (14.3–25.7) Gy. The CpG ODN-induced enhancement of tumor radioresponse was diminished in tumor-bearing mice immunocompromised by sublethal whole-body radiation. Tumors treated with CpG ODN and radiation showed histologic changes characterized by increased necrosis, heavy infiltration by host inflammatory cells (lymphocytes and granulocytes), and reduced tumor cell density. These results show that CpG ODNs are potent enhancers of tumor radioresponse and as such have potential to improve clinical radiotherapy.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/64/15/5074/2516805/5074.pdf",""

Standard sampling methods such as thin sections, core plugs, and even whole core are at a scale too small to resolve these heterogeneities, and direct measurement of flow properties is not straightforward. Moreover it is not obvious what physical formulism (e.g., Darcy's law, Forchheimer's Law, Stokes flow) is appropriate for modeling flow or interpreting flow measurements, nor is it clear that traditional homogenization approaches (e.g., effective medium theory, renormalization, dual-porosity) are applicable in such systems. We report simple measurements on a large 25 cm diameter by 36 cm high sample of Cretaceous carbonate containing centimeter-scale vugs, and compare them to flow fields computed from high-resolution CT images of the same sample. These computations use a single-physics Darcy-flow model. We also compute passive tracer transport in the same model to evaluate preferential flow paths within the rock. The direct computations are based on a porosity grid extracted from a set of CT images (512 × 512 × 240 pixels, 0.5 mm resolution) of the large sample. We also use the single-physics model to estimate the length scale of connections between vugs in this sample. The results demonstrate the need for upscaling methods that preserve connectivity of features in highly heterogeneous rocks.","https://onepetro.org/SPEATCE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/90336-MS/2872848/spe-90336-ms.pdf",""

The literature on public finance and Third World taxation has been sceptical of these claims, although a small literature within economics favouring tax cuts does exist. Neither side provides compelling empirical evidence for or against tax relief as a tool to generate employment. The present paper provides such evidence for Brazilian restaurants, hotels and barber/beauty shops in the period 1940–1980. After controls are introduced for the size of potential markets and the impact of other non-tax costs, tax rates have virtually no effect on employment. This is because many Third World firms are characterized by a constellation of forces that theoretically minimize the link between taxation and employment. Third World governments that seek to increase employment in strategic industries would be better off using their funds to create programmes designed to stimulate employment proactively.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1024529042000269789",""

Gas hydrates that contain large volumes of hydrocarbon energy accumulated in a few hundreds of meters of sediments near the earth surface. The potential volume of gas-in-place in a hydrated state is estimated to exceed 1.5x1016 m3. A single m3 of natural gas hydrate contains about 150-160 m3 of gas. About 98% of all gas hydrate deposits are found offshore in deep water in upper sedimentary layers. The most prospective regions are in the oceanic slopes. The thickness of hydrate-bearing rock may reach hundreds of meters, and in some conditions exceed 1 kilometer. Large amounts of free gas or liquid hydrocarbon can accumulate under the impermeable hydrate roof. Such coexistence of deposits can be very efficient for hydrocarbon production.","http://onepetro.org/OTCONF/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.4043/16677-MS/1855239/otc-16677-ms.pdf",""

We observe that the coercivity of the inhomogeneous Fe/Gd ferrimagnet makes a local minimum near the Tcomp. When a 16-nm-thick Gd layer is deposited over a (Fe 4 nm/Gd 4 nm)4 multilayer, exchange bias emerges due to the interfacial interaction of the thick Gd overlayer and the Fe surface of the multilayer. Negative and positive exchange bias were observed below and above the Tcomp, respectively. In addition, there is a continuous transition from negative exchange bias to positive exchange bias across the Tcomp where coercivity makes the local minimum.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/95/9/4949/18709194/4949_1_online.pdf",""

Describing lipoproteins as particles that are composed of lipid and protein and illustrating the variation in particle density that is determined by the constantly changing lipid and protein composition clarifies the metabolic pathway and physiological function of lipoproteins as lipid transporters. Such a description will also suggest the critical role played by apolipoproteins in lipid transport. The clarification of lipoproteins as particles that change density will help students understand the nomenclature used to classify lipoproteins as well.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/advan.00048.2003",""

The demand for flatter semiconductor substrates has been increasing as the size of the features that can be transferred onto a wafer surface becomes smaller. There are a number of factors affecting wafer planarity, most of which can be corrected by conventional wafer chucks. However, the problem of backside particles (particles affect a large portion of wafer real estate by causing out-of-plane distortion when they get lodged between a wafer and a wafer chuck) has not been adequately addressed by the current wafer chuck technology. The compliant pin chuck was designed to address this concern and fabricated from silicon using lithography based microfabrication techniques. The chuck consists of an array of microflexure mechanisms that react to the presence of backside particles so as to minimize the nonplanarity caused otherwise. It is also shown through experimental results that the fabricated chuck has a planarity of 120nm (standard deviation −3σ) over an area of 30mm×30mm and is less sensitive to backside particles than a conventional wafer chuck.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-pdf/22/6/3147/15999150/3147_1_online.pdf",""
