This research provides geospatial-temporal incidence models of this disease in the U.S. and explanatory models to account for hospitals’ number of heart failure DRGs using technical, workload, financial, and geospatial-temporal variables. The research also provides updated financial and demand estimates based on inflationary pressures and disease rate increases. Understanding patterns is important to both policymakers and health administrators alike for cost control and planning. Methods Geographical Information Systems maps of heart failure diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) from 2016 through 2018 depicted areas of high incidence as well as changes. Simple expenditure forecasts were calculated for 2016 through 2018. Linear, lasso, ridge, and Elastic Net models as well as ensembled tree regressors including were built on an 80% training set and evaluated on a 20% test set. Results The incidence of heart failure has increased over time with highest intensities in the East and center of the country; however, several Northern states (e.g., Minnesota) have seen large increases in rates from 2016. The best traditional regression model explained 75% of the variability in the number of DRGs experienced by hospital using a small subset of variables including discharges, DRG type, percent Medicare reimbursement, hospital type, and medical school affiliation. The best ensembled tree models achieved R2 over .97 on the blinded test set and identified discharges, percent Medicare reimbursement, hospital acute days, affiliated physicians, staffed beds, employees, hospital type, emergency room visits, medical school affiliation, geographical location, and the number of surgeries as highly important predictors. Conclusions Overall, the total cost of the three DRGs in the study has increased approximately $61 billion from 2016 through 2018 (average of two estimates). The increase in the more expensive DRG (DRG 291) has outpaced others with an associated increase of $92 billion in expenditures. With the increase in demand (linked to obesity and other factors) as well as the relatively steady-state supply of cardiologists over time, the costs are likely to balloon over the next decade.","https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-12290/v1",""

For the past five years, the graduation rate for undergraduate students has been falling. The main factors contributing to this decline may involve indirect or direct stress on the student. For instance, learning space and environment impact undergraduate students and their stress levels which impacts their graduation rates. We hypothesized that students in the SCALE UP (Students Centered Active Learning Environment for Undergraduate Programs) classroom have lower concentrations of salivary stress biomarkers (cortisol and α‐amylase) than students in traditional classrooms, and perform better academically than their counterparts. We screened students learning introductory biology in two different learning environments, a SCALE UP and a lecture hall, collected salivary samples twice a week, and asked the students to self rate their stress level from not stressed to very stressed. Saliva was collected at the beginning and end of each class period to measure a change in cortisol or α‐ amylase over the class period. We used an Enzyme‐Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) to quantify the concentration of salivary cortisol and a colorimetric method to determine the α‐ amylase. Students in the SCALE UP classroom had lower α‐amylase activity than those in a traditional lecture hall. Cortisol concentrations were not correlated with the classroom environment. The results of the α‐amylase assay aligned closer with the literature, indicating that salivary α‐amylase is better at identifying acute stressors, such as a classroom environment than cortisol. The setup of a SCALE UP class may have less of an impact on student stress than the pedagogy. The results of the study highlight the importance of pedagogy on student stress and the significance of salivary α‐amylase as an acute, noninvasive stress biomarker.

Participants (N = 140), ages 54 and older, were recruited from the Amazon Mechanical Turk and were compensated for their participation. Participants completed a survey investigating their likelihood to engage in trolling behaviors, the extent to which they enjoy trolling, and their feelings while trolling. Results indicated that while there were no significant differences between men and women in their need, intensity of use, or addiction to social media, men were significantly more likely to engage in trolling behaviors than women. Men reported posting to upset others (p = .018), as well as commenting to upset others (p = .053), more often than women. Furthermore, when engaging in these behaviors, men reported feeling intelligent (p = .013), confident (p = .024), superior (p = .053), and happy (p = .012), more often than women. However, these results could be indicative of a more sinister issue. Men also reported more often that their reasons for engaging in trolling behaviors were feelings of loneliness (p = .005) and anxiety (p = .010). This indicates that these trolling behaviors may then be a way for men to seek out some form of “social support” in the online community.","http://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/4/Supplement_1/317/34915678/igaa057.1015.pdf",""

An increase in world population and food demands requires fish production to dramatically increase over the next decade. One of the major obstacles of increasing aquaculture production is disease. Thus, a key aspect of aquaculture research is understanding immune health and the spread of disease within farmed populations and into wild stocks. A major portal for pathogen entry in fish is the nose; nasal infections tend to be severe and result in damage to the olfactory and nervous systems. Immune health is impacted by numerous systems including the microbiome. The microbiome trains the immune system, provides a barrier for pathogens, and helps maintain homeostasis. Therefore, dysbiosis, a disruption of the microbiome due to changes in diet, exposure to pollutants, antibiotic consumption, and physiological stress, can contribute to disease. One common pollutant in water is agricultural runoff containing nitrates and nitrites, which are known to cause stress in fish and can be deadly in some concentrations. However, it is unknown how nitrites impact the microbiomes of sensitive tissues and how these changes impact immune health. I hypothesize that increased nitrite concentrations will cause dysbiosis of the microbiome resulting in changing abundance and diversity of the microbiome. This work aims to determine the impacts of sublethal levels of nitrite on the nasal microbiome and compare it to the microbiomes of the gills and gut. For 2 months goldfish (10 fish/30L tank) were held under various nitrite concentrations, 0.0mM (control), 0.01mM, 0.1mM, and 1.0mM. The system utilized continuous aerated water flow at 24°C to maintain the desired concentrations of nitrite. Tissue samples were collected from each fish with water collected to serve as a control to determine the host‐specific microbiome. The DNA from the tissues were extracted, amplified, and prepared as a library for sequencing using 16S rRNA gene primers for Illumina MiSeq. The sequences were analyzed using the DADA2 pipeline in R and MaAsLin from Galaxy. The gill microbiome showed no significant changes in abundance compared to the control treatment. The nose microbiome appears to show an increase in diversity compared to the control microbiome; however, these changes were not determined to be significant. Both the gut and water microbiomes showed significant changes in abundance compared to their control levels, with the gut microbiome changing the most. Sublethal levels of nitrite exposure significantly increase the diversity of the microbial communities of the water and the gut microbiomes. There are also some indications that the nose and gill microbiomes are impacted, however, small sample sizes could be obscuring the changes. These impacts imply that sublethal nitrite concentrations can cause dysbiosis of the fish microbiomes and could have negative impacts of fish health.","",""

If one of these signals is not received, then the selected behavior may not occur. It is known that chemical and visual signals play a role in reproductive behavior in fish, but whether they work together is not fully understood. We hypothesize that both visual and chemical cues are necessary in reproductive behavior of the sailfin molly, and therefore we expect the fish to respond to multimodal cues in order to complete the reproductive cycle. Our objective was to analyze attractive behavior of sailfin males and females to chemical, visual and chemical + visual cues from the opposite sex. A two‐choice maze constructed of acrylic was split into two sections with each side being 106cm (L) × 30.5cm (w). At the bottom of the maze is an open mixing area, which also doubled as the starting point for each trial. Plastic mesh was placed in each half of the maze to create turbulence and even flow throughout the maze. Water was pumped from the top of the maze using a hose and exited the maze downstream through four drain holes. Previously done dye tests confirmed that the water flow was even throughout each half of the maze and exited through the drain holes without mixing at the exit point for each trial. A small clear box with holes was placed in the maze and used for the chemical + visual signal, a black box with holes was used for the chemical only signals, and a separate clear box with no holes was used for the visual only signal. The fish of the opposite sex being tested was placed in the box located in the maze about 3/4 upstream. At the start of each trial a fish was placed in the mixing area for 10 minutes in order to acclimate. It was then given access to both sides of the maze for 10 minutes which established side preference. Cues were placed on the least preferred side of the maze in order to avoid bias and the fish behavior was observed for another 10 minutes for each cue. A Wilcox rank test was used to determine the preference for each cue. Behavioral responses showed a significant visual and a visual+chemical preference for both sexes. Visual cues had higher index of preference than visual+chemical cues, which suggest a deterrent component in sailfin odors. Chemical cues alone did not elicit swimming behavior. Although it was demonstrated in previous studies that male chemical cues induce release sex steroid release in female sailfin molly. This study shows that multimodal cues are critical for the reproductive behavior of sailfin molly and opens a new avenue of research in communication of live‐bearing species.","",""

Neuroblastoma is a neuroendocrine cancer arising from sympathetic neuronal precursors that circumvent the differentiation process into mature neurons and glia. The poor differentiation status of neuroblastoma cells allows them to retain features of early embryonic stem cells. SAPCD2 is a newly identified cell cycle regulator involved in mitotic progression and spindle assembly. Although the mechanism by which SAPCD2 exerts its effect is poorly understood, its function appears to be critical in early embryonic development where it regulates mitotic spindle orientation, planar polarization in cell progenitors, and tissue segmentation. More relevant to this study, a recent investigation has revealed that SAPCD2 plays a role in symmetric planar divisions during early embryonic segmentation by interacting with the Gαi‐LGN‐NuMA ternary spindle assembly complex, which appears to be critically important for modulating differentiation of neuroepithelial cells. The expression of SAPCD2 is generally exclusive to embryonic tissues except in the case of malignancies where it is dramatically overexpressed compared to normal tissues. Its overexpression has been observed in several cancers such as in the lung and liver, but its relevance to neuroblastoma has not been reported in the current literature. The objective of this study is to investigate whether SAPCD2 expression levels in human neuroblastoma tissues are correlated with disease progression and if so, to further characterize its role in regulating neuroblastoma cell survival in vitro.

In the process of light to dark adaptation of fish eyes, cAMP is hypothesized to be a regulatory signal between the photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) that drives pigment granule aggregation in the latter. We hypothesize that cAMP is exported from the photoreceptors into the sub‐retinal space, and one of the slc22 OAT proteins imports cAMP into the RPE. To test this hypothesis, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) was used to test for the presence of mRNA encoding seven different OAT proteins (1, 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d, 2e and 3) in whole eyes from zebrafish. Messenger RNA encoding each of the OAT proteins was detected, corroborating results of earlier studies. Experiments are underway to test which of the OAT genes are expressed in isolated RPE.

Deep Learning networks generally require large datasets for training. In some health care applications, such as the real-time smartwatch-based fall detection, there are no publicly available, large, annotated datasets that can be used for training, due to the nature of the problem (i.e., a fall is not a common event). We conducted a series of offline experiments using two different datasets of simulated falls for training various ensemble models. Our offline experimental results show that an ensemble of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models, combined by the stacking ensemble technique, outperforms a single RNN model trained on the same data samples. Nonetheless, fall detection models trained on simulated falls and activities of daily living performed by test subjects in a controlled environment, suffer from low precision due to high false-positive rates. In this work, through a set of real-world experiments, we demonstrate that the low precision can be mitigated via the collection of false-positive feedback by the end-users. The final Ensemble RNN model, after re-training with real-world user archived data and feedback, achieved a significantly higher precision without reducing much of the recall in a real-world setting.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3428666",""

As large quantities of nitrogenous compounds drain into streams and rivers it can dramatically alter the natural nitrogenous concentrations in aquatic ecosystems. Nitrite is an intermediate compound in the nitrogen cycle, and its concentrations can range from 1 mM to 0.5 mM in freshwater and marine ecosystems. Exposure to elevated nitrite concentrations can disrupt physiological and endocrine processes such as ion and hormone regulation, respiratory, and cardiovascular activity. However, there is a lack of research in the effects of nitrite on sensitive organs such as the olfactory epithelium. Fish olfactory systems is highly sensitive and can detect odors in the picomolar concentration. To detect odors, this specialized sensitive system must be continuously exposed to the environment, making it highly susceptible to environmental toxins.

Heifers originated from 4 cow-calf ranches, and were reared in the same herd within each ranch since birth. Heifers were loaded by source into commercial livestock trailers at the auction yard, and transported for 8 h to stimulate the stress of a long haul. Heifers were not mixed with cohorts from other sources prior to and at the auction yard. Upon arrival at the receiving yard (d -2), shrunk body weight (BW) was recorded, and heifers were maintained in 4 paddocks by source with ad libitum access to hay, water, and a mineral supplement for 36 h. On d 0, heifers were ranked by source and shrunk BW and allocated to 1 of 24 drylot pens (4 heifers/pen) containing: 1) heifers from a single source (NOCOM, n = 8 pens), 2) heifers from 2 sources (COM2, n = 8 pens), or 3) heifers from 4 sources (COM4, n = 8 pens).

This case study employs counter-life story methodology to uncover the hidden truths about Dunbar residents and congregants’ experiences to generate new knowledge about the experiences of African Americans in San Marcos, Texas, and Hays County. Thematic analysis of unfiltered commentary from Dunbar community members revealed three emergent themes: history of racism and slavery, impact of environmental and social racism, and rebuilding and restoring the community.

No treatment effects were detected (P ≥ 0.37) for plasma concentrations of haptoglobin, whereas plasma cortisol concentrations were greater (P = 0.05) in CON vs. BAS steers on d 7 (treatment × day; P = 0.07). Incidence of BRD was greater (P ≤ 0.05) in BAS vs. CON on d 6 to 10 and d 18 to 21 (treatment × day; P &lt; 0.01), although overall BRD incidence did not differ (P = 0.24) between treatments. The number of antimicrobial treatments required per steer diagnosed with BRD symptoms to recover from sickness was greater (P = 0.04) in CON vs. BAS calves. No treatment differences were detected (P ≥ 0.41) for mortality incidence, or proportion of steers removed from the experiment due to extreme sickness. Results from this experiment indicate BAS administration upon feedlot entry improved average daily gain by enhancing feed efficiency. Administration of BAS facilitated earlier detection of BRD and reduced the need for antimicrobial treatments. Collectively, these results suggest BAS administration as a promising strategy to benefit performance and immunocompetence of feedlot receiving cattle.","http://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/98/Supplement_4/193/34594625/skaa278.355.pdf",""

This study investigated the within‐person relationship between caffeine intake and sleep duration at home. In a national database, 377 participants (aged 35–85 years) completed a 7‐day diary study. Sleep duration was measured by Actigraphy and caffeine intake was self‐reported in sleep logs. Three analytic strategies were used. The average sleep duration and the average caffeine intake were not significantly correlated. Multilevel regressions using daytime caffeine intake to predict night‐time sleep, and using night‐time sleep to predict next day caffeine intake, also did not detect any significant effect. Then dynamical systems analysis was performed, where the daily change rate and change tendency of caffeine and sleep were estimated, and the relationship among these momentums was examined. Results revealed a significant effect of sleep duration on the change tendency of caffeine use: a shorter sleep duration predicted a stronger tendency to consume caffeine, and this phenomenon was only found in middle‐aged adults (aged 35–55 years) not in older adults (aged 55+). This study did not detect any effect of daily caffeine intake on sleep duration, implying that habitual use of caffeine in real life may not coincide with laboratory findings, and that using caffeine to compensate for sleep loss is the habit of middle‐aged adults, not the elderly. The advantage of using a dynamic approach to analyse interrelated processes with uncertain time lags is also highlighted.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fjsr.12996",""

Objective: To determine if a low (45-kHz) or high (1-MHz) frequency delivered a higher dexamethasone (Dex) concentration through the skin. Design: Controlled laboratory study. Setting: Laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 40 healthy men between the ages of 18 and 45 years (age = 23.1 ± 2.6 years, height = 176.1 ± 7.2 cm, mass = 88.5 ± 19.4 kg, posterior calf subcutaneous thickness measured using musculoskeletal ultrasound imaging = 0.6 ± 0.2 cm). Intervention(s): Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups (ultrasound frequency at microdialysis probe depth): (1) 45-kHz frequency at 1 mm, (2) 45-kHz frequency at 4 mm, (3) 1-MHz frequency at 1 mm, or (4) 1-MHz frequency at 4 mm (n = 10 in each group). Three linear microdialysis probes were inserted at the desired tissue depth. We rubbed dexamethasone sodium phosphate (Dex-P) into the skin and then applied a 15-minute phonophoresis treatment. Main Outcome Measure(s): Dialysate was collected during the treatment and 60 minutes posttreatment and analyzed for Dex-P, Dex, and the metabolite form of Dex. The sum of the 3 analytes was calculated as total dexamethasone (Dex-total), and differences between the 45-kHz and 1-MHz treatment groups were determined by a repeated-measures analysis of variance. Results: At 1 mm, 3 (30%) participants in the 45-kHz and 4 (40%) participants in the 1-MHz group had measurable levels of Dex-P. Total dexamethasone increased after the treatment ceased, independent of ultrasound frequency (P &lt; .001), with a trend of the 45-kHz treatment to produce a greater increase in drug concentration (P = .006). At 4 mm, 5 (50%) participants in the 45-kHz and 1 (10%) participant in the 1-MHz group had measurable levels of Dex-P. We observed no difference in Dex-total concentration between treatment groups at 4 mm (P = .72). Conclusions: Phonophoresis provided a mechanism for Dex-total delivery at the 1- and 4-mm tissue depths. However, the effectiveness of the ultrasound frequencies varied between the 2 measured tissue depths.","http://meridian.allenpress.com/jat/article-pdf/55/6/628/2523892/i1062-6050-55-6-628.pdf",""

The current study also examines potential differences between pregnant and parenting dyads in this association. Background: The early transition to parenthood places adolescents at an elevated risk of negative outcomes. Thus, it is important to understand the mechanisms that might place adolescent parents at risk (parental stress) or promote resilience in the transition to parenthood (coparenting dynamics). Methods: Using the actor–partner interdependence model, the current study examined how parental stress was associated with coparenting communication and conflict among a sample of 105 predominately Latinx adolescent parent dyads. Results: Mothers' reports of parental stress were associated with their own and their coparents' report of coparenting communication and conflict. Fathers' parental stress was only associated with their own coparenting conflict. Further, significant differences were not observed between pregnant and parenting dyads. Conclusion: The results highlight the nuanced gender dynamics between adolescent parents and support the idea that coparenting dynamics are similar across the transition to parenthood. Implications: These findings suggest that parental stress, especially adolescent mothers' parental stress, has a salient influence on coparenting. Thus, programs and services for adolescent parents might target reducing parental stress to improve coparenting dynamics.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/fare.12499",""

In 2011, a research residence was built to evaluate various land-use and sustainable components. This Texas house has subsequently been used for both residential and research purposes. The purpose of this case study was to evaluate break-even construction considerations, to assess environmental impacts, and to evaluate qualitatively efficacy of sustainable options incorporated in the research residence. Some of the specific components discussed are home site placement (directional positioning); materiel acquisition (transportation); wood product minimization; rainwater harvesting; wastewater management; grid-tied solar array power; electric car charging via a solar array; geothermal heating and cooling; insulation selection; windows, fixtures, and appliance selection; and on-demand electric water heaters for guest areas. This study seeks to identify the impact of proper land use and sustainable techniques on the environment and return-on-investment in rural areas. Break-even and 15-year Net Present Value (NPV) analysis at 3% and 5% cost of capital were used to evaluate traditional construction, partially sustainable construction, and fully sustainable construction options for the case study house, which was built sustainably. The additional cost of sustainable construction is estimated at $54,329. At 3%, the analysis suggests a 15-year NPV of $334,355 (traditional) versus $250,339 million (sustainable) for a difference of $84K. At 5% cost of capital, that difference falls to $63K. The total estimated annual difference in carbon emissions is 4.326 million g/CO2e for this research residence. The results indicate that good choices for quick return-on-investment in rural construction would be the use of engineered lumber, Icynene foam, and Energy Star windows and doors. Medium-term options include photovoltaic systems (PVS) capable of powering the home and an electric car. Sustainable construction options should positively affect the environment and the pocketbook.

The olfactory sensory system is comprised of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) which express unique receptors that discriminate a vast array of odorants. Direct exposure to the external environment makes OSNs susceptible to infection by microorganisms. Crypt cells, a specialized type of OSN found only in fish, have been shown to act as a portal of infection for pathogens such as Infectious Hematopoietic Necrosis Virus (IHNV). Intranasal exposure to IHNV results in activation of crypt cells which propagates an action potential that activates the brain immune system and results in apoptosis of crypt cells. It is unclear if fish can also smell bacteria and what the neural route of integration for this signal is. We hypothesize that virus and bacteria are detected by a different subset of crypt cells and the information is integrated in different areas of the brain.

This poster will discuss a novel bilingual community health screening and education (CHS & E) through laboratory science service-learning (SL) study abroad (SA) program that could be utilized to improve community engagement and understanding of public health issues from a lab perspective. Methods: In collaboration with The Foundation for International Medical Relief of Children (FIMRC), Texas State University faculty member, Joanna Ellis, and five CLS senior-level students traveled to Huancayo, Peru in June of 2018 for a CHS & E through lab science SL-SA program. Utilizing the self-powered Lab-in-a-Suitcase from International Aid, the group conducted four CHS & E through lab science events in four different communities. We conducted hemoglobin, urinalysis, glucose, cholesterol, and STI screenings on more than 160 people. The CUY Project was the most involved activity with six interactive stations for the families to learn about anemia, parasites, and nutrition through lab tests. Parents and children learned more about their conditions through interactive lab science activities and tests. Following the workshop, parent participants were given an anonymous survey about their knowledge before and after the workshop as well as their suggestions for its improvement. Results: The lab-science based activities illustrated the biological impact of their lifestyle and dietary choices in a new and impactful way. Participants self-assessed that they learned significantly more about anemia and diabetes during the workshop. Participants learned more about hygiene than they knew before the workshop; however, the increase was not statistically significant. Parent participants surveyed (100%) stated that the workshop would help them make decisions in caring for their children and would help prevent future health problems. Conclusion: Although the newest iteration of the workshop is entitled Health Education Advances with Lab Science (HEALS) this poster will describe the preparation, implementation, and first stage of evaluation of the CHS & E through laboratory science workshop in Peru. This poster session is an opportunity to discuss how laboratory professionals can interact with their community and showcase the value of the field in public health education initiatives.","http://academic.oup.com/ajcp/article-pdf/154/Supplement_1/S129/34050174/aqaa161.283.pdf",""

The aim of this study is to identify the relationship between recent widowhood and change in depressive symptoms in older adults, and how social support moderates this association. Utilizing observations from the nationally representative Health and Retirement Study, the analytic sample consisted of 2,890 adults age 50 and over who were partnered or married in 2012. Depression was measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale short form (CESD-8). Positive social support was measured as perceived social support from family, friends, and children. Widowhood was a dichotomous measure indicating mortality of spouse between 2012 and 2014. Autoregressive multiple regression was used to determine if widowhood was associated with change in depression from 2012-2104 and whether positive social support moderated this relationship. Widowhood was associated with an increase in depressive symptoms from 2012-2014 (b=0.967, SE=0.145, p &lt;.001) and social support was negatively associated with change in depression (b=-0.021, SE=0.004, p &lt;.001). Social support appeared to moderate the association between widowhood and change in depression (b=0.068, SE=0.026, p =.010), though widowed older adults with higher social support appear to have more rapid increase in depression than those with lower social support. These preliminary findings and implications for supporting bereaved older adults will be discussed.","http://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/4/Supplement_1/69/34912991/igaa057.226.pdf",""

Grounded theory was used to analyze responses until a point of thematic saturation. The results indicate that consumers take a broad, inclusive view of wildlife crime. Participants describe the immediate probable future where micro‐, meso‐, and macrolevel wildlife crimes persist, and a preferred future of wildlife, including among others, reduced wildlife crime, decreased animal cruelty, and human–wildlife symbiosis.

RE efforts have already been successful in extracting device level functionalities from an integrated circuit (IC) with very limited resources [6]. Camouflaging is an obfuscation method that can thwart such RE [7-9]. Existing work on IC camouflaging primarily uses fabrication techniques such as doping and dummy contacts to hide the circuit structure or build cells that look alike but have different functionalities. While promising these Si complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) based obfuscation techniques adds significant area overhead and are successfully decamouflaged by the Satisfiability solver (SAT)-based reverse engineering techniques [9-13]. Emerging solutions, such as polymorphic gates based on giant spin Hall effect (GSHE) are promising but adds delay overhead in hybrid CMOS-GSHE designs restricting the camouflaging to a maximum of 15% of all the gates in the circuit. Here, we harness the unique properties of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) including MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, WS2, and WSe2 and their optically transparent transition metal oxides (TMOs) to demonstrate novel area efficient camouflaging solutions that are resilient to SAT-attack and automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) attacks. We show that resistors with resistance values differing by 8 orders of magnitude, diodes with variable turn-on voltages and reverse saturation currents, and field effect transistors (FETs) with adjustable conduction type, threshold voltages and switching characteristics can be optically camouflaged to look exactly similar by engineering TMO/TMD heterostructures allowing hardware obfuscation of both digital and analog circuits. Since this 2D heterostructure devices family is intrinsically camouflaged, NAND/NOR/AND/OR gates in the circuit can be obfuscated with significantly less area overhead allowing 100% logic obfuscation compared to only 5% for CMOS-based camouflaging. Finally, we demonstrate that the largest benchmarking circuit from ISCAS’85, comprised of more than 4000 logic gates when obfuscated with the CMOS-based technique are successfully decamouflaged by SAT-attack in less than 40 minutes; whereas, it renders to be invulnerable even in more than 10 hours, when camouflaged with 2D heterostructure devices thereby corroborating our hypothesis of high resilience against RE. Our approach of connecting unique material properties to innovative devices to secure circuits can be considered as one of its kind demonstrations, highlighting the benefits of cross-layer optimization.","https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-81183/v1",""

We measured rumen–reticulum organ mass and absorptive capacity in captive white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus (Zimmermann, 1780)) from central Texas, USA. Deer consumed a pelleted ration, ad libitum, of 1.77 kcal/g (low) or 2.67 kcal/g (standard) digestible energy from the time animals were weaned.

Molar height was lower in animals consuming the low energy diet. Analyses indicated sex-specific responses. Males eating the low energy diet had heavier rumen–reticulum organs, but females did not.

A collective narrative is a channel through which participants express themselves, and it thus signifies clues about their identities, values, and experiences. No study to date, however, has examined the contents of the stories. Using the generativity model as a theoretical underpinning for analysis, this paper examines the emergent themes of such collective stories. Research Design and Methods: This study used the data collected in a memory care community where a research team recruited and engaged 21 out of approximately 80 residents with dementia in 6 weekly creative storytelling sessions; 4 small groups of 4 to 6 participants created a total of 24 collective stories. Three researchers analyzed these stories by open-coding emergent themes. Once coded manually, the narratives were managed and analyzed in NVivo. Results: Consistent with the concept of generativity, a thematic analysis of collective narratives revealed various aspects of participants’ generative concerns. Three themes related to generativity: (1) caring and promoting the well-being of others, (2) family values, and (3) positivity. Discussion and Implications: The narratives show that participants living with dementia continue to express their generative values and concerns. The findings reveal generative identities held by persons living with dementia, which help destigmatize dementia. The findings also shed light on why creative group storytelling may affect multiple positive outcomes for its participants.","http://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/4/2/igaa002/32977295/igaa002.pdf",""

Although numerous recent studies have focused on base‐flow discharge in mountain systems, almost no work has explicitly investigated the role of karst groundwater in these systems across a full range of flow conditions. We directly measured groundwater discharge from 48 karst springs in the Kaweah River and its five forks in the Sierra Nevada mountains, California, United States. Relationships between spring and river discharge showed that karst aquifers and springs provide significant storage and delayed discharge to the river. Regression models showed that, of all potential seasonal groundwater storage compartments in the river basin, the area of karst (0.1–4.4%) present provides the best explanation of base‐flow recession in each fork of the Kaweah River (directly measured contributions from karst springs ranged from 3.5 to 16% during high‐flow to 20 to 65% during base‐flow conditions). These results show that, even in settings where karst represents a small portion of basin area, it may play an over‐sized role in seasonal storage and water resources in mountain systems. Karst aquifers are the single most important non‐snow storage component in the Kaweah River basin, and likely provide similar water storage capacities and higher base flows in other mountain river systems with karst when compared with systems without karst.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fhyp.13833",""

As a low-cost, more stable alternative to current hole transport materials, CuI may be used to template the epitaxial growth of perovskites such as CsPbBr3 owing to a 1% lattice constant mismatch and larger bulk modulus. We compare all eight atomic terminations of the interfaces between the (100) low-energy facet for both CsPbBr3 and CuI, increasing material thickness to consider charge density redistribution and bonding characteristics between surface and bulk-like regions. A low energy atomic termination is found to exist between these materials where alternating charge accumulation and depletion regions stabilize bonds at the interface. Band offset calculations reveal a type I straddling gap offset in the bulk shifting to a type II staggered gap offset as the thickness of the materials is increased, where the built-in potential changes as layer thickness increases, indicating the tunability of charge separation at the interface. CuI may, thus, be used as an alternative hole transport layer material in CsPbBr3 optoelectronic devices.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/adv/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/5.0018925/12977370/085023_1_online.pdf",""

Because shoppers travel hundreds of miles in pursuit of prescription drugs, data sharing should be an imperative.

Research supports the positive impact of the use of AT such as decreased burden on caregivers and behavioral support for people with dementia. Four reviews in the last six years have analyzed AT and PWD, but none have incorporated the dimension of medical outcomes. Objectives: The purpose of this review is to identify the facilitators, barriers, and medical outcomes commensurate with the use of AT with PWD. Method: This review queried The Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Web of Science, Science Direct, and PubMed databases for peer-reviewed publications in the last five years for facilitators, barriers, and medical outcomes commensurate with the use of AT with PWD. The study is reported and conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and the Kruse Protocol for conducting a systematic review. Results: 48 studies were analyzed. Fourteen types of AT, 17 facilitators, 17 barriers, and 16 medical outcomes were identified in the literature. The two most frequently mentioned ATs were cognitive stimulators (9/48, 19%) and social robots (5/48, 10%). The two most frequently mentioned facilitators were caregivers want AT (8/68, 12%) and enables increased independence (7/68, 10%). The top two barriers were cost (8/75, 11%) and PWD reject AT (8/75, 11%). The top medical outcomes were improved cognitive abilities (6/69, 9%), increased activities of daily living (ADLs), and increased autonomy (each at 5/69, 7%): Zero negative outcomes were reported. Conclusion: The systematic review revealed the positive relations that occur when PWD and their caregivers use AT. Although many reservations surrounding the use of AT exist, a majority of the literature shows a positive effect of its use. Research supports a strong support for AT by caregivers due to many positive medical outcomes, but also a reticence to adopt by PWD. If ATs for PWD are a way to reduce stress on caregivers, barriers of cost and complexity need to be addressed through health policy or grants.","https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/8/3/278/pdf",""

This research provides geographical incidence and cost models of this disease in the U.S. and explanatory models to account for hospitals’ number of heart failure DRGs using technical, workload, financial, geographical, and time-related variables. Methods: The number of diagnoses is forecast using regression (constrained and unconstrained) and ensemble (random forests, extra trees regressor, gradient boosting, and bagging) techniques at the hospital unit of analysis. Descriptive maps of heart failure diagnostic-related groups (DRGs) depict areas of high incidence. State- and county-level spatial and non-spatial regression models of heart failure admission rates are performed. Expenditure forecasts are estimated. Results: The incidence of heart failure has increased over time with the highest intensities in the East and center of the country; however, several Northern states have seen large increases since 2016. The best predictive model for the number of diagnoses (hospital unit of analysis) was an extremely randomized tree ensemble (predictive R2 = 0.86). The important variables in this model included workload metrics and hospital type. State-level spatial lag models using first-order Queen criteria were best at estimating heart failure admission rates (R2 = 0.816). At the county level, OLS was preferred over any GIS model based on Moran’s I and resultant R2; however, none of the traditional models performed well (R2 = 0.169 for the OLS). Gradient-boosted tree models predicted 36% of the total sum of squares; the most important factors were facility workload, mean cash on hand of the hospitals in the county, and mean equity of those hospitals. Online interactive maps at the state and county levels are provided. Conclusions. Heart failure and associated expenditures are increasing. Costs of DRGs in the study increased $61 billion from 2016 through 2018. The increase in the more expensive DRG 291 outpaced others with an associated increase of $92 billion. With the increase in demand and steady-state supply of cardiologists, the costs are likely to balloon over the next decade.

Results indicate students find value in having guest speakers, but not all speakers are created equal, and faculty need to strategically select who they invite and guide the presentation styles. Students prefer knowledgeable and passionate industry professionals as well as alumni who can share personal and industry examples. Gender and racial differences indicate women and Hispanic students have greater interest in learning from guest speakers.

As such, a great need has risen for the fabrication of these NPs in large scales. In this study, we used a high throughput fiber reactor for the preparation of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs via nanoprecipitation. The fiber reactor provided a high surface area for the controlled interaction of an organic phase containing the PLGA solution with an aqueous phase, containing poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) as a stabilizer. This interaction led to the self-assembly of the polymer into the form of NPs. We studied operational parameters to identify the factors that have the greatest influence on the properties of the resulting PLGA NPs. We found that the concentration of the PLGA solution is the factor that has the greatest effect on NP size, polydispersity index (PDI), and production rate. Increasing PLGA concentration increased NP sizes significantly, while at the same time decreasing the PDI value. The second factor that was found to affect NP properties was the concentration of PVA solution, which resulted in increased NP sizes and decreased production rates. Flowrates of the feed streams also affected NP size to a lesser extent, while changing the operational temperature did not change the product’s features. In general, the results demonstrate that fiber reactors are a suitable method for the large-scale, continuous preparation of polymeric NPs suitable for biomedical applications.","https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/13/14/3075/pdf",""

The proposed system performs a special type of spatial mapping, capable of converting a scanned indoor environment to a vector facet model. A ray-tracing algorithm uses the facet model for wireless signal predictions. Finally, an AR application overlays the signal strength predictions on the physical space in the form of holograms. Although some indoor reconstruction models have already been developed, this paper proposes an image to a facet algorithm for indoor reconstruction and compares its performance with existing AR algorithms, such as spatial understanding that are modified to create the required facet models. In addition, the paper orchestrates AR and ray-tracing techniques to provide an in situ network visualization interface. It is shown that the accuracy of the derived facet models is acceptable, and the overall signal predictions are not significantly affected by any potential inaccuracies of the indoor reconstruction. With the expected increase of densely deployed indoor 5G networks, it is believed that these types of AR applications for network visualization will play a key role in the successful planning of 5G networks.","https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/3/690/pdf",""

When it obstructs problem‐solving, individuals must reframe their approach. We examined how different training techniques—chunk decomposition (i.e., considering an object’s basic parts and physical properties) and constraint relaxation (i.e., considering an object’s different functions)—might rely upon different routes to creative reframing. Additionally, we investigated how different forms of cognitive load interact with these dual routes. Participants learned one of three techniques. Chunk decomposition participants created object breakdown diagrams; constraint relaxation participants created object functions lists; and free association (control) participants wrote a word that they associated with each of several concrete nouns. After training, participants attempted to solve five functional fixedness problems. E1 investigated how increasing germane cognitive load via either direct or indirect prompting affected training transfer. Experiment 2 investigated how reducing extraneous cognitive load by providing no transfer instructions and using an eye‐closure strategy. Across both experiments, results supported differences in accuracy and response latency by training. However, chunk decomposition and constraint relaxation did not follow the same pattern, suggesting different mechanisms of the effect. We discuss possible applications to increase innovation in real‐world domains such as education, business, and engineering.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fjocb.442",""

Mobility limitations were operationalized as a log-transformed count of 11 indicators of limitation in physical mobility. Dietary quality was measured using the Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010 (AHEI-2010) based on responses to a food frequency questionnaire. Food insecurity was a binary measure based on the USDA six-item short form. Nutritional assistance included receipt of supplemental food from sources such as food banks and/or reporting receipt of SNAP benefits (1=yes, 0=no). Autoregressive multiple regression was used to test whether AHEI-2010 predicted change in mobility limitations from 2012-2014 and whether food insecurity or receipt of supplemental food moderated this relationship. Around 10.7% of older adults were food insecure, and around 17.5% reported receipt of nutritional assistance. AHEI-2010 was associated with a slower decline in mobility limitations over the 2-year observational window (b=-0.014, SE=.003, p&lt;.001), but food insecurity nor nutritional assistance were associated with changing mobility limitation, either directly or as moderators of the association between progressing limitations and AHEI-2010.

There are multiple reasons that makes food traceability a challenging task including diversity of stakeholders and their lexicons, standards, tools and methods; unwillingness to expose information of internal operations; lack of a common understanding of steps in a supply chain; and incompleteness of data. Ontologies can address the traceability challenge by creating a shared understanding of the traceability model across stakeholders in a food supply chain. They can also support semantic mediation, data integration, and data exploration.

Nine environmental interpreters participated in a 4-week mindfulness intervention program and engaged in in-depth conversations regarding their experience with mindfulness and interpretation. Constructivist grounded theory coding and analysis indicated that participants in the study experienced the construct of mindfulness in a variety of ways and perceived its impact on their interpretive practice in the following ways specifically: (a) it enhanced personal experiences of nature, and (b) it created more authentic interpretive experiences for their program attendees.

For instance, non‐Hispanic (NH) Black mothers are more likely to have an infant with encephalocele, although less likely to have an infant with anotia/microtia compared to NH Whites. When stratifying by nativity and years lived within the United States, additional variations become apparent. Methods: Data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study were used to calculate descriptive statistics and estimate crude/adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) among NH Blacks with one of 30 major defects and non‐malformed controls. Total case/controls were as follows: U.S.‐ (2,773/1101); Foreign‐ (343/151); African‐born (161/64). Study participants were also examined by number of years lived in the U.S. (≤5 vs. 6+ years). Results: Compared to U.S.‐born, foreign‐born NH Black controls tended to be older, had more years of education, and were more likely to have a higher household income. They also had fewer previous livebirths and were less likely to be obese. In the adjusted analyses, two defect groups were significantly attenuated: limb deficiencies, aORs/95%CIs = (0.44 [0.20–0.97]) and septal defects (0.69 [0.48–0.99]). After stratifying by years lived in the United States, the risk for hydrocephaly (2.43 [1.03–5.74]) became apparent among those having lived 6+ years in the United States. When restricting to African‐born mothers, none of the findings were statistically significant. Conclusions: Foreign‐born NH Blacks were at a reduced risk for a few selected defects. Results were consistent after restricting to African‐born mothers and did not change considerably when stratifying by years lived in the United States.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fbdr2.1665",""

Our matched case–control study examined data on 3–5 year‐old patients with any ASD diagnosis in the Texas Medicaid system in 2010–2012. Subjects were linked to their 2007–2009 newborn screening blood test data, which included values for 36 analytes or analyte ratios. Data were available for 3,005 cases and 6,212 controls. The most compelling associations were evident for fatty acid oxidation analytes octanoylcarnitine (C8) and octanoylcarnitine/acetylcarnitine (C8/C2). Their adjusted odds ratios comparing 10th versus first analyte deciles were between 1.42 and 1.54 in total births, term births, and males. C8 was consistent with first screen results. Adipylcarnitine (C6DC), an organic acid analyte, showed opposite results in the two screens. Several other analytes exhibiting significant associations in the first screen did not in the second. Our results provide evidence that abnormal newborn blood levels of some carnitines may be associated with risk of later ASD, possibly related to their involvement with mitochondrial function in the developing brain.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fajmg.b.32804",""

REWOD has been demonstrated to effectively generate electrical current at a low frequency range (&lt; 3 Hz), which is the frequency range for various human activities such as walking, running, etc. However, the current generated from the REWOD without external bias source is insufficient to power such motion sensors. In this work, to eventually implement a fully self-powered motion sensor, we demonstrate a novel bias-free REWOD AC generation and then rectify, boost, and amplify the signal using commercial components. The unconditioned REWOD output of 95–240 mV AC is generated using a 50 μL droplet of 0.5M NaCl electrolyte and 2.5 mm of electrode displacement from an oscillation frequency range of 1–3 Hz. A seven-stage rectifier using Schottky diodes having a forward voltage drop of 135–240 mV and a forward current of 1 mA converts the generated AC signal to DC voltage. ∼3 V DC is measured at the boost converter output, proving the system could function as a self-powered motion sensor. Additionally, a linear relationship of output DC voltage with respect to frequency and displacement demonstrates the potential of this REWOD energy harvester to function as a self-powered wearable motion sensor.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2020-24189/6637846/v008t08a035-imece2020-24189.pdf",""

In this paper, the optical properties of commonly used binders (PG 64-22, Rubber modified binder, and SBS modified binder) containing wax additives (LEADCAP and Sasobit) were investigated using UV-Vis spectrometer. The result of this study showed that (1) the addition of modifiers (crumb rubber and SBS) with the base binder slightly increases the absorption of the binder; (2) the binder types and aging level have significant contribution on optical properties; (3) in general, the aged binders were observed to have higher reflectivity compared to the unaged binders; and (4) the addition of wax additives is observed to have a significant effect on the optical properties.","http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/ace/2020/4170691.pdf",""

For example, there was a large gap between when the digital camera was invented and when it became popularly used, and when it was adopted by law enforcement agencies to capture images for the documentation of crime scenes and physical evidence. Similarly, although smartphones are commonly used for taking photos and are gradually replacing digital cameras to become the mostly used photography devices, using smartphones for evidence photography is still uncommon among law enforcement agencies. In this article, we discuss a particular use scenario of smartphone photography, that is, using a smartphone to capture images of latent fingerprints. To collect experimental data, images of fingerprints were taken by a standard digital SLR camera and a smartphone camera. The numerical values representing the fingerprint qualities of these two sets of images were then generated by a Biometric SDK software. From the comparison of the quantitative image quality results, we concluded that no statistically significant difference was found between the two image acquisition devices.

While the use of simulations has grown in business education, the research on simulations is quite nascent. This is especially true when it comes to understanding which factors lead students to perform better or worse in a business simulation environment. By integrating goal the orientation and generative learning literature, this study seeks to address this shortcoming in the existing literature. More specifically, we explore how student teams’ goal orientation affects their team’s performance in a simulation context. Results suggest Learn and Avoid Goal orientations are positively related to an objective performance metric (i.e., sales growth), while the Avoid Goal orientation is positively related to a subjective performance metric of team effectiveness. On the other hand, the Prove Goal orientation was negatively related to both metrics.

The chivalry hypothesis suggests women are treated more leniently than men and, therefore, less likely to be arrested.

Methods:: Using the 2015 Korean national census data, 429 individuals were selected and classified into two groups based on visual impairment level: severe and mild. A one-way multivariate analysis of variance was used to compare each group difference, followed by univariate analyses. Results:: Participants with mild visual impairment reported social activity was the highest mean scores on health perception ( M = 2.70, SD = 0.56) and life satisfaction ( M = 3.54, SD = 0.37), and religious activity was the highest mean score on self-esteem ( M = 2.79, SD = 0.52).

Microglia could be polarized into two phenotypes: pro‐inflammatory (M1) and anti‐inflammatory (M2). The pro‐inflammatory phenotype of microglia is known to harmful in ischemic stroke disease processes. An intervention, therefore, that could shift the phenotype of microglia toward the anti‐inflammatory phenotype could be beneficial in cerebral protection against ischemic stroke. Intermittent hypoxic training (IHT) protects the microglia against hypoxia and reoxygenation stress and increases the M2/M1 ratio. The involvement of the melatonin, an antioxidant, was proposed from the many laboratories. We studied the function of melatonin in the polarization of microglia in the IHT. Methods: EOC20, mouse microglia, have been assigned to the control, oxygen‐glucose deprivation (OGD), IHT, OGD + IHT. The cell viability of each group was assayed by using Calcein‐AM assay. The phenotype of EOC20 cells was determined with immunocytochemistry staining CD 68 (M1) and CD 206 (M2) and quantified by flow cytometry. The involvement of melatonin (30 μM) and melatonin receptor was determined by using melatonin and melatonin receptor antagonist, Luzindole (50 μM). Protein contents of melatonin receptor 1B, Akt, Erk1/2 were measured by immunoblot. Two factors (treatment and protocol) ANOVA and Tukey post hoc test was used to find statistical significance. P<0.05 was considered a significant value. Result: Cell viability in the OGD group was significantly decreased comparing to the control, IHT, OGD+ IHT groups. Meaningful elevation in the melatonin 1B receptor and phosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2 were detected, but those protein contents were blunted with Luzindole treatment. M2/M1 ratio was altered with melatonin treatment, control group 0.32 and melatonin group 2.7. Conclusion: Microglia was activated and polarized to the pro‐inflammatory phenotype after OGD and reoxygenation. However, IHT was able to mitigate cell death and shift the phenotype to the anti‐inflammatory phenotype. IHT‐induced favorable effects including phenotype of microglia were diminished by inhibiting melatonin 1B receptor with Luzindole.

This cross-sectional study examined associations between adolescent dietary behaviors and family/home environments with parent-adolescent dyadic analysis. Methods. Secondary data were analyzed for adolescents and their parents who participated in the 2014 Family Life, Activity, Sun, Health, and Eating (FLASHE) study. Relationships between adolescent and parent intake of convenience/fast-food, fruits/vegetables, and sugar, as well as family/community and mealtime environments, were examined using Pearson’s correlations, 2-sample t tests, analysis of variance, and general linear model analyses. Results. Among this nationwide parent-adolescent dyad sample (N = 1890), a moderate relationship between parent and adolescent consumption of convenience/fast-foods ( r = 0.426) and fruits/vegetables ( r = 0.416) was found. Adolescent convenience/fast-foods intake differed by sex, neighborhood socioeconomic status, meals eaten with family, and meals eaten in front of the TV ( P < .001 for all) as well as race/ethnicity ( P = .004). Adolescent fruit/vegetable intake differed by home location ( P = .029), school location ( P = .032), meals eaten together with family, meals eaten in front of the TV, and body mass index category ( P < .001 for all). Generalized linear models revealed multiple predictors of adolescent dietary behaviors. Conclusion. Findings suggest dynamic relationships between adolescent and parent dietary cancer risk factors and adolescent fruit/vegetable consumption disparities by multiple environmental factors.

The vast majority of MCH research has focused only on males. Further, how endogenous levels of MCH parallel metabolic and behavioral measures over time, or are affected by diet, has not previously been investigated. We evaluated how endogenous MCH changes, as a function of sex, in adult rats as they consumed either a control diet alone, or a control diet supplemented with a high fat/high sugar (i.e., “Western”) diet. During the final week of this 8 week dietary manipulation period, rats received daily injections of the MCH receptor 1 antagonist GW803430 (3 mg/kg) or vehicle (1 mL/kg). Weekly blood sampling for the duration of the diet manipulation allowed for measurement of circulating MCH, insulin, leptin, and glucose levels. Surprisingly, we noted that GW803430 significantly reduced endogenous MCH levels only in males consuming control diet. Endogenous insulin levels were also dramatically lowered in males receiving GW803430, independent of diet condition. Though female rats did not exhibit these hormonal changes in response to drug, they did exhibit diet‐ and drug‐specific emotional behavior responses in the forced swim test that mapped on to endogenous MCH levels. Ongoing analyses are examining leptin levels, food consumption, and hepatic steatosis in relation to endogenous MCH. To our knowledge, these are the first investigations into how MCH receptor 1 antagonism affects circulating metabolic hormones, and into how this drug affects emotional behavior in females. To confirm involvement of the MCH receptor 1 in these sex‐selective hormonal reductions and behavioral effects, future experiments will employ a different MCH receptor 1 antagonist.

In the domain of social anxiety, however, studies examining links between social cognitive ability and anxiety have produced mixed results. One potential explanation is that varied facets of social cognition are differentially linked to social anxiety across development. To better understand how social cognition relates to social anxiety, we assessed multiple facets of two important social cognitive capacities—mind‐mindedness and theory of mind— in school‐aged children aged 7–12 and young adults aged 18–24. We also measured social anxiety traits. We found that, across ages, mind‐mindedness and theory of mind were not related to each other. Additionally, for children and adults, higher levels of social anxiety correlated with higher levels of mind‐mindedness toward close social partners, indicating an increased propensity to describe partners using mental state terms. By contrast, social anxiety was not correlated with theory of mind, which measured the ability to decipher or attribute mental states to photographs, videos, or story characters. These findings offer insight into how different components of social cognition are related and how more naturalistic measures of social cognition involving relationships may relate to social anxiety across development.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fsode.12468",""

In situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy monitored changes in the composition of the SSE Li garnet [Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LLZTaO)] upon annealing in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) and upon Ar+ ion sputtering. Trends in core level spectra demonstrate that binding energy (BE) calibration of the Li 1s at 56.4 eV yields a more consistent interpretation of results than the more commonly used standard of the adventitious C 1s at 284.8 eV. Annealing one ambient-exposed sample to &gt;1000 K in UHV effectively reduced surface carbonate and oxygen, leaving significant amounts of carbon in lower oxidation states. A second ambient-exposed sample was subjected to 3 keV Ar+ ion sputtering at 500 K in UHV, which eliminated all surface carbon and reduced the O 1s intensity and BE. These methods present alternative approaches to lithium carbonate removal than heating or polishing in inert atmospheres and are compatible with fundamental surface science studies. In particular, the data show that sputtering at mildly elevated temperatures yields facile elimination of carbonate and other forms of surface carbon. This is in contrast to annealing in either UHV or noble gas environments, which result in carbonate reduction, but with significant remnant coverages of other forms of carbon.","http://avs.scitation.org/doi/am-pdf/10.1116/1.5128102",""

The AI-PoP beads were made using Plaster of Paris powder, antibiotic, and tap water, cured for 24 hours, sterilized by ethylene oxide, and stored up to 5 months before testing. For each antibiotic, twenty beads were combined with bovine serum in sterile tubes and incubated at 37° C on a rocker. Serum was replaced at intervals over the 14 day study period, and antibiotic concentrations were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry. Separately, the growth of E. coli and T. pyogenes in eluent from 10 beads for each antibiotic was quantified by flow cytometry. Results: Antibiotic was detected in AI-PoP bead eluent for 14 days for all but the ampicillin beads, for which antibiotic was detected for 8 days. The concentration of antibiotic in eluent was greater than five times the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of tested bacteria for the entire study period for penicillin, tetracycline, and florfenicol. The concentration of ampicillin remained greater than five times the MIC of E. coli for 4 days and T. pyogenes for 5 days.

However, depictions of activists as information disseminators do not explain how they perform their quintessential role – pressuring resistant firms to engage in responsible innovation that emphasizes the creation of socioenvironmental value. Drawing from social movement theory that identifies claims as the instrument of such pressure, we examine four activist organizations’ use of claims across six campaigns to drive firms to adopt more socially and environmentally responsible practices, a form of responsible innovation. Our core contribution is an empirically grounded theory of activist‐driven responsible innovation (ARI) that proposes how activists use claims to drive firms to engage in responsible innovation, as well as how features of the two sides may shape this outcome. Our ARI theory primarily enriches accounts of stakeholder influence on corporate social responsibility in the CSR domain and, in doing so, secondarily enriches accounts of the influence of activists’ claims on firms in the social movement domain. These contributions also speak to the resolution of grand challenges, a core interest of the special issue.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fjoms.12548",""

I argue that ES and CG research agendas are characterized by a meaningful overlap and attempts to synthesize them will add value to both bodies of knowledge. This paper overviews both of these research agendas, identifies major challenges and gaps in the extant literature in ES, and suggests how CG can help move the ES research agenda forward.

Data were collected through mapping the built environment, an electronic daily transportation diary app called “MyAmble” on tablets, walk audits and focus groups.

To fill the gap, we used data from the Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (2000-2014) and analyzed 15,379 respondents (13,278 non-Hispanic whites and 2,101 non-Hispanic blacks) ages 50 and older in 2000 who had no dementia. Discrete-time event history models were estimated. Our preliminary analysis showed that marital status was significantly associated with the odds of dementia for both whites and blacks. Furthermore, the associations between unmarried status (i.e., cohabiting, widowed, and never married) and dementia were stronger among blacks than whites. The effect of divorce on odds of dementia did not differ by race. The results were robust after controlling for socioeconomic status, health and lifestyle factors, and social engagements.

Researchers and clinicians strive to identify and rehabilitate those at risk of falling in order to mitigate the impact of fall events and prevent future falls. Recently, perturbation-based balance testing and interventions have received increased attention, partly because reactive postural control responses triggered by perturbations are important for balance recovery during actual falls. However, current systems are limited by the need for multiple individuals to operate the device, downtime between trials to reset the perturbation and/or single mode functionality. To this end, we have developed a Perturbation Platform System that can induce perturbations in both vertical and angled directions. Results The system consists of two box platforms that can individually perform straight (25.4 mm, 50.8 mm and 76.2 mm) and angled (5°, 10°, and 15°) height changes while an individual is standing or walking overground. In addition, the system can automatically reset to the original position following perturbation. The platform achieves peak downward accelerations of 5.41 m/s2 during drop events that simulate sudden changes in foot-contact surfaces. Conclusions The novel system can be used in a laboratory setting to better understand balance response and control mechanisms. In addition, this portable system can be used in a clinical or home setting to provide perturbation-based balance exercises that aim to improve balance and mobility.","https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-13958/v1",""

Here, we consider such futures through readings of Kim Stanley Robinson’s Three Californias Trilogy, which imagines various sociopolitical futures for southern California. Attending to the roles that infrastructures play in shaping these futures, we argue for a perspective that sees collapse as an opening of material possibility and highlight aspects of infrastructures, such as their distribution in space that might prove meaningful in thinking about such crises and transitions.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0263775820911940",""

We find that banks that disclose a material weakness in internal controls have higher risk-taking and worse performance in the future, including having a higher (lower) likelihood of experiencing large losses (gains). These findings suggest that weak controls increase (reduce) downside (upside) risk-taking or conversely that strong controls increase (reduce) upside (downside) risk-taking. Path analyses suggest that 22.3 to 43.7 percent of the effect of internal control quality on future performance is through risk-taking. Additionally, material weaknesses are negatively associated with total asset, loan, interest income, and non-interest income growth, suggesting that internal control quality affects both core and non-core activities of banks. Overall, results suggest that strong internal controls improve bank risk-taking, in part through asymmetrically reducing downside risk-taking while facilitating upside risk-taking, ultimately improving bank performance.","https://publications.aaahq.org/ajpt/article-pdf/40/2/49/51191/i1558-7991-40-2-49.pdf",""

Exit velocities (EV) and chute scores (CS) were recorded at weaning. Starting three months post-weaning, ADG was measured across a 28-d period prior to testing commencement. Pen Scores (PS) from all steers were taken at the end of the 28-d period. Steers were video recorded during an Open Field Test (OFT), an Individual Startle Test (IST), a Group Startle Test (GST), and during a Bovine Zero Maze (BZM) evaluations, and the number of steps performed during each test recorded. Steers experienced each test twice, in random order, across a 50 day period with a 5-day minimum washout period between tests. Repeatability (Pearson’s correlation; PROC CORR), validity (relative to ADG; PROC REG), and reliability (Chronbach’s alpha; PROC CORR) were evaluated for PS, EV, CS, and the number of steps performed in the OFT, IST, GST, and BZM. Correlations among ADG, PS, EV, and CS illustrated that as ADG increased, EV (FEAR; R = -0.41; P = 0.02) and PS (PANIC; R = -0.42; P = 0.02) decreased. No relationship was observed between ADG and CS (RAGE). A positive relationship (R = 0.45; P = 0.01) was observed between PS (PANIC) and EV (FEAR). No relationship was observed between CS (RAGE) and EV nor between CS (RAGE) and PS (PANIC). The data separated (PROC VARCLUS) into the three primary clusters (FEAR, RAGE, and PANIC/SEEKING). The number of steps in the GST (FEAR) clustered with ADG and EV (FEAR). The number of steps in the BZM (PANIC/SEEKING), OFT (PANIC/SEEKING), and IST (PANIC/SEEKING) clustered together. Chute score (RAGE) did not cluster with any of the other variables. A model was developed to illustrate these relationships.

Lifestyle interventions to decrease obesity might serve to prevent obesity-induced PDAC. We examined whether decreasing obesity via increased physical activity (PA) and/or diet-induced weight loss could prevent PDAC in mice and compared the levels of systemic inflammatory-associated cytokines in human subjects undergoing a PA intervention. Methods: Obesity-induced PDAC mouse models were exposed to various interventions before and after cancer initiation, that included increased PA, diet-induced weight loss, and/or chemotherapy. We evaluated body composition, tumor progression, growth, fibrosis, and inflammation. Circulating inflammatory-associated cytokines of overweight/obese human subjects before and after a PA intervention were also compared. Results: Genetically engineered PDAC mice on a PA intervention while on a HFD, gained less weight, displayed lower grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias lesions, and fewer mice developed PDAC compared to controls. Similar results were observed in PDAC mice given a HFD to induce obesity, prior to a control diet (CD) and PA intervention, compared to mice given a CD after the HFD. PA alone or with a CD intervention decreased body weight but did not prevent tumor growth in an orthotopic mouse model of PDAC. PA combined with chemotherapy increased the percentage of splenic cluster of differentiation 8+ (CD8+) T cells in PDAC mice. Finally, PA prevented the increase of systemic inflammatory-associated cytokines in PDAC mice and in overweight/obese control human subjects. Conclusions: PA alone or with diet-induced weight loss delayed the progression of PDAC in genetically engineered mice and reduced inflammation. While these interventions did not prevent tumor growth in the orthotopic mouse model, it did modulate immune responses. Reducing obesity by increasing PA and decreasing dietary fat intake could be a way of reducing the incidence of PDAC in high-risk obese individuals.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/80/22_Supplement/PO-034/645571/Abstract-PO-034-Increased-physical-activity-delays",""

As long‐term residents of the city evacuated, New Orleans witnessed an influx of new Latino/a immigrants who arrived to demolish irreparable structures, clear toxic debris, and rebuild. Disaster recovery work draws on construction and low‐skilled service sectors, which are already niches for undocumented Latino/a labour in the USA. Migration to disaster recovery sites is a potentially lucrative strategy for undocumented migrants, who use their mobility to seek better employment. By highlighting differences in gendered labour experiences in a neoliberal disaster‐recovery context, this study illustrates how migrant‐labour niches and a lack of reproductive support systems constrain opportunities and shape migrants’ mobility strategies. Through a perspective of constrained agency, it considers how migrants’ experiences differ according to gender as they negotiate labour and care possibilities. The constraints on migrant aspirations are explored through interview and survey data collected from 256 Latino/a migrants to post‐Katrina New Orleans who were working between 2006 and 2008. The paper argues that while disaster recovery sites create opportunity for some of the most vulnerable workers, gendered immigrant employment niches and the absence of reproductive support constrain women’s success.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/area.12687",""

Using SQUID magnetometer, the magnetic properties are studied when the magnetic field was applied both in plane and out of plane. The Curie temperature of this structure is found to be at 290 K. Most significantly, at 2 K, we observed a complete up/down shift (along magnetization axis) of hysteresis loop when the sample was cooled under a magnetic field of ± 5000 Oe in the in-plane configuration. We believe that the strong antiferromagnetic (super) exchange coupling of Mn-Cr across the two interfaces is responsible for the observed exchange bias.

Guided by the Health Belief Model, we also examined whether subjective health perception would function as a mediator in the link between physical health constraints and psychological distress. Using data from 533 Asian Americans aged 60 and over (mean age=69.4, SD=6.88) in the 2016 Asian American Quality of Life Study, the direct and indirect effect models were tested with multivariate linear regressions and the PROCESS macro. Advanced age, unmarried status, lower levels of acculturation, and more chronic physical conditions were significant predictors of psychological distress. When subjective health perception was added to the model, an additional 5% of the variance was accounted for, resulting in 25% of the total variance explained by the estimated model. Negative health perception was a significant predictor of increased level of psychological distress. Supporting the mediation hypothesis, all direct paths among physical health constraints, subjective health perception, and psychological distress were significant. The indirect effect of physical health constraints on psychological distress through subjective health perception status was significant, as evidenced by the 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the indirect effect not containing zero (.07, .28). The findings not only help better understand the psychological mechanisms that underlie physical health constraints and psychological distress but also suggest avenues for interventions.","http://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/4/Supplement_1/336/34913171/igaa057.1080.pdf",""

Furthermore, in many instances, doctoral students begin teaching while they are still in their doctoral program without any formal training. We aim to address this institutionalized deficiency by providing a concise and actionable framework for teaching doctoral students how to teach that can serve as a template for other business school doctoral programs seeking to implement a doctoral teaching seminar. We provide an example of a doctoral teaching seminar in a College of Business developed to train doctoral students in five teaching competencies intended to ensure they are able to provide quality instruction to university students.

Within location heifers were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups: 1) PG16 (n = 452), heifers received a CIDR insert on d 0 for 14 d, a 25-mg injection of PGF 16 d after CIDR removal [d 30], and a 100-µg injection of gonadotropin-releasing hormone concurrently with TAI 66 ± 2 h later; or 2) PG17 (n = 459), heifers were treated the same as PG16, however, PGF was administered 17 d after CIDR removal [d 31], and heifers were TAI 66 ± 2 h later. Estrus detection patches were applied to heifers at the time of PGF administration and were examined for activation at TAI. Dominant follicle diameter was determined via transrectal ultrasonography at PGF administration and TAI in a subset of heifers (n = 171). Furthermore, transrectal ultrasonography was performed to determine pregnancy rates to TAI (PR/AI) between 30 and 45 d after TAI. Estrus expression prior to TAI was similar (P = 0.50) between treatments (48.9 vs. 52.0%, respectively). Moreover, dominant follicle diameter at PGF and TAI was similar (P ≥ 0.43) between PG16 and PG17 heifers. Pregnancy rates to TAI did not differ (P = 0.48) between treatment groups (46.4 vs. 48.9%, respectively). The results of this experiment indicate that delaying the injection of PGF from d 30 to d 31 along with TAI in the 14-day CIDR-PG & TAI protocol had no effects on fertility parameters in beef heifers. In conclusion, the PGF injection and TAI in the 14-d CIDR-PG & TAI protocol may be delayed, providing more flexibility in scheduling without negatively affecting fertility.","http://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/98/Supplement_4/375/34595861/skaa278.660.pdf",""

Cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction may contribute to heart disease associated with T2DM and obesity. The purpose of this study was to test hypothesis that a maternal obesogenic diet would alter offspring cardiac mitochondrial function and systemic metabolism. Female CD‐1 mice were fed either a high‐fat, high‐sucrose diet (HFHS) or a refined low‐fat, low‐sucrose diet (LFLS) for eight weeks before initiation of pregnancy, gestation, and during lactation. At 21 days, male mice were randomly divided into 3 groups: offspring of HFHS dams weaned onto a standard chow diet (HC), HFHS diet (HH), or offspring of LFLS dams continue fed to LFLS diet (LL). Glucose and insulin tolerance tests were performed in 6 month‐old male offspring, followed by sacrifice for evaluation of cardiac mitochondrial respiratory function. HFHS diet‐induced maternal obesity impaired glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in HH offspring. Switching offspring to the control diet (HC) did not decrease body weight associated with maternal obesity, but significantly decreased subcutaneous fat mass compared to the HH, and preserved glucose tolerance and insulin responsiveness to near LL levels. In freshly isolated cardiac mitochondria, maximal oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)‐linked respiratory capacity and coupling efficiency was significantly higher in the HC in the presence of fatty acid substrate (palmitoylcarnitine) compared to LL. In the absence of fatty acids, OXPHOS‐linked respiratory capacity and OXPHOS coupling control were not altered. These results indicate that both maternal and postnatal diet modulate offspring cardiac mitochondrial metabolism, favoring greater fatty acid oxidation in offspring fed a control diet following maternal obesity.

The data for this study were provided by 44 students (20 boys; 24 girls) who participated in a larger longitudinal project on students’ running motivation in schools. They were individually interviewed from fourth to eighth grade. All interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed verbatim for inductive analysis, revealing the criteria that students used to assess their own ability in running and reasons why they believed they could improve their ability in running. Frequencies and percentages were computed to determine changes in students’ ability assessment criteria over time. Results showed that students used ability, effort, task mastery, intra-individual comparisons, and social comparisons as criteria to assess their own ability in running as they progressed from the fourth to eighth grade. However, they increasingly used social comparison in assessment as they became older. Most students believed they could improve their ability in running, suggesting that they were incremental theorists. Ability/maturation, effort, experiences, and influences from significant others were cited as contributors to their beliefs about improving running ability. This study took the first step to provide longitudinal qualitative data on students’ ability beliefs about running in physical education/athletics classes.

The impact of UV light disinfection and the level of interdependence between the modalities remains unclear. Methods: Samples were collected from 5 high touch surfaces from 10 patients room following discharge prior to manual disinfection, following manual disinfection, and following pulsed xenon UV disinfection using Rodac contact plates (total 150 samples). Colonies were identified using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The bacterial colony counts were recorded and analyzed as pathogenic or commensal organisms (based on CDC criteria) to assess the efficacy of the disinfection process. Results: Average colony counts for the rooms prior to disinfection, post disinfection, and post UV light were 185.8 CFU +/- SD 280, 43 CFU +/- 121, and 20 CFU +/- 36.7 respectively. The average drop in colony-forming units of the five high touch areas in patient’s rooms can be seen in table 1. Twelve commensal bacterial species were isolated: Bacillus species (sp.), Corynebacterium sp., Enhydrobacter sp., Kocuria sp., Lysinibacillus sp., Macrococcus sp., Micrococcus sp., Paenibacillus sp., Pantoea sp., Psychrobacter sp., Siccibacter sp., Coagulase negative staphylococcus. Seven pathogenic bacteria were isolated: Acinetobacter sp., Brucella sp., Proteus sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia sp., Enterococcus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Reductions in the predominant bacterial species following disinfection modality are noted in table 2. Conclusion: A combination of manual disinfection and UV has shown a notable additional reduction in overall bacterial contamination of the patient rooms, including the majority of high touch areas as compared with manual disinfection alone. No additional reduction in commensal bacteria isolates was noted after UV light, however a further decrease in pathogenic bacteria (Acinetobacter and Enterococcus) was noted. UV light may be considered as an additional room disinfection method to reduce overall bacterial burden and pathogenic bacterial contamination of rooms as a comprehensive strategy to reduce nosocomial infections.

Econometric examination of over 31,000 minor league games across multiple leagues and seasons finds proximity to an opponent’s major league parent team increases attendance.

Thirty-one participants (n = 31; males = 15, females = 16; Age: 21 ± 3.5 years) participated in an ASD involving professional actors playing the role of one active gunman, as well as four victims. The ASD lasted approximately 50 s. Blood samples were collected 15 min prior as well as after the ASD and analyzed for epinephrine (EPI) and norepinephrine (NE) levels. Saliva samples were collected 30 and 5 min prior to the ASD and 5 and 30 min after the ASD, were analyzed for cortisol, α-amylase, and secretory immunoglobulin-A (SigA). The ASD resulted in significant (p < 0.05) increases in EPI, α-amylase, and SigA levels. The increase in NE from pre to post ASD approached significance (p = 0.06). These results demonstrate that a short duration (~50 s) ASD results in significant increases in both blood and salivary markers of stress.

Methods: Using MarketScan data, the study identified 23,440 opioid-naïve patients who received surgery for breast cancer between January 2000 and December 2014 and filled at least one opioid prescription attributable to surgery. Prolonged opioid use was defined as one or more prescriptions for opioids within 90 to 180 days after surgery and defined extra-prolonged opioid use as one or more opioid prescriptions between 181 and 365 days after surgery. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed to ascertain factors associated with prolonged and extra-prolonged use of opioids. Findings: Of the 23,440 patients, 4,233 (18%) had prolonged opioid use, and 2,052 (9%) had extra-prolonged opioid use. Patients who received mastectomy plus reconstruction had the highest rate of prolonged opioid use (38%) followed by mastectomy alone (15%). A multivariable logistic regression confirmed that patients with mastectomy and reconstruction had the highest odds ratio of prolonged opioid use compared to lumpectomy and whole breast irradiation (adjusted odds ratio, 5.6; 95% confidence interval, 5.1–6.1). Mean daily opioid dose was consistently high without any obvious dosage reduction among patients with opioid use.

Here, we establish the first high-precision U-Pb zircon geochronological framework for the province. Weighted mean 206Pb/238U dates from mafic and felsic rocks in the Wichita Mountains indicate emplacement in a narrow time frame from 532.49 ± 0.12 Ma to 530.23 ± 0.14 Ma. Rhyolite lavas in the Arbuckle Mountains farther east yield weighted mean 206Pb/238U dates of 539.20 ± 0.15 Ma and 539.46 ± 0.13 Ma. These dates for the WIP indicate that magmatism in the Southern Oklahoma Aulacogen postdated the ca. 540 Ma rift-drift transition along the Appalachian margin to the east. Whole-rock trace-element and isotopic geochemistry, supplemented by trace elements in zircon, tracks the evolution of magma sources during WIP petrogenesis. These data indicate that initial melting and assimilation of subcontinental mantle lithosphere by an uprising mantle plume were followed by increasing involvement of asthenospheric melts with time. We suggest that upwelling of this plume in the area of the Southern Oklahoma Aulacogen triggered an inboard jump of the spreading center active along the eastern margin of Laurentia, which led to separation of the Precordillera terrane (now located in Argentina) from the Ouachita embayment present in the southern Laurentian margin.","https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-pdf/49/3/268/5236737/268.pdf",""

Wildlife, such as snakes (suborder Serpentes), are prone to entanglement in erosion control blankets (ECBs) that contain polypropylene mesh with fused apertures. Previous reports have noted that the occurrences of entanglements are not uniform in their distribution across an ECB, but primarily occur where the edge of the mesh is exposed. We conducted an experiment to determine if modification to the installation methods of ECBs affects the likelihood of snake entanglement. We conducted entanglement trials to compare the likelihood of snake entanglement between two treatments: 1) exposed ECB edge (i.e., perimeter) and 2) buried ECB edge. Snakes were less likely to attempt to pass through the mesh on the buried edge treatment and all entanglements occurred on the exposed edge treatment. These results provide support that modification to the installation methods reduces snake entanglement in ECBs in some settings. However, we conducted our study in an experimental setting, and it should be evaluated under natural field conditions. This research can be used to inform several parties including contractors, habitat managers, and agency decision makers on additional steps that can be taken for products that fit their application needs to minimize risks to wildlife.","http://meridian.allenpress.com/jfwm/article-pdf/11/1/273/2511650/i1944-687x-11-1-273.pdf",""

In this correlation research study, instructors administered surveys to students in a required first-year orientation course. Survey data was then merged with institutional data. The results of the multiple regression analysis suggested that first-year grade expectations, present-focused time perspective, age, ethnicity, first-generation status, and academically underprepared status were statistically significant predictors of first-semester GPA and explained 9.0% of the variation, whereas future-focused time perspective, sex, and economically disadvantaged status were not.

Research has documented this as a concern in relation to safe infant sleep health campaigns. Often, caregivers' knowledge of recommended practices is not associated with a change in infant sleep choices. Purpose:: Health campaigns, including most safe infant sleep efforts, often share specific risk factors and steps for avoiding risk, that is, in a verbatim format. Research has shown that caregivers' behavior may be more likely to change when presented with messages based on their general understanding of risk, that is, gist-based format. This research examines caregivers' responses as related to verbatim- and gist-based safe sleep information. Methods:: Five hundred forty-one caregivers of infants were shown 12 images depicting infants in safe or unsafe sleep spaces. Images varied across three commercially available spaces, infant race, and presence/absence of one policy-based risk factor. Results:: Differences in caregivers' discernment of safe and unsafe sleep images paralleled reported differences in knowledge of safe sleep recommendations. Discernment of safe/unsafe images was greater for White than Black caregivers, as well as for females in comparison with male caregivers. Gist-based considerations, such as familiarity with the sleeper depicted or infant race, were also associated with caregivers' discernment of safe/unsafe images. Implications for practice:: Attending to both gist- and verbatim-based knowledge regarding safe infant sleep campaign information may help to effectively facilitate caregivers' ability to always create safe sleep spaces for their infants.","https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/JXX.0000000000000365",""

Ninety-six recently weaned Angus-influenced heifers were obtained from an auction facility. Heifers originated from four cow-calf ranches, and were reared in the same herd within each ranch since birth. Heifers were loaded into two livestock trailers at the auction yard (two sources per trailer; d −2), arranged in two sections of each trailer according to source, and transported for 10 h to stimulate the stress of a long-haul. Heifers were not mixed with cohorts from other sources prior to and at the auction yard. Upon arrival (d −2), shrunk body weight (BW) was recorded and heifers were maintained in four paddocks by source with ad libitum access to a complete starter feed and water for 36 h. On d 0, heifers were ranked by source and shrunk BW and allocated to 1 of 24 drylot pens (four heifers per pen) containing: 1) heifers from a single source (1SRC, n = 8), 2) heifers from two sources (2SRC, n = 8), or 3) heifers from four sources (4SRC, n = 8). From d 0 to d 55, heifers had free-choice access to the complete starter feed and water. Heifers were assessed daily for symptoms of bovine respiratory disease (BRD), and feed intake was recorded from each pen daily. Blood samples were collected on d 0, d 6, d 13, d 27, d 41, and d 55, and shrunk BW (after 16 h of water and feed withdrawal) was recorded on d 56 for average daily gain (ADG). No treatment differences were noted (P ≥ 0.56) for heifer ADG (mean ± SE = 0.853 ± 0.043 kg/d), final shrunk BW, feed intake, and feed efficiency.

Objective: To identify which metrics of thigh-muscle function discriminate between patients who meet and patients who fail to meet age- and sex-matched normative values for patient-reported knee function in the first 9 months after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) and establish cutoffs for these metrics by covariate subgroups. Design: Cross-sectional retrospective study. Setting: Laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 256 patients (129 females, 128 males; age = 17.1 ± 3.0 years, height = 1.7 ± 0.1 m, mass = 74.1 ± 17.9 kg, months since surgery = 6.4 ± 1.4), 3 to 9 months after primary unilateral ACLR. Main Outcome Measure(s): We stratified the sample into dichotomous groups by the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score (IKDCMET, IKDCNOT MET) using sex- and age-matched normative values. We measured quadriceps and hamstrings isokinetic (60°/s) torque and power bilaterally. Normalized quadriceps and hamstrings peak torque (Nm/kg) and power (W/kg), limb symmetry indices (LSI, %), and hamstrings : quadriceps ratios were calculated. Logistic regression indicated which of these metrics could predict IKDC classification while controlling for age, graft type, and sex. Receiver operating characteristic curves established cutoffs for explanatory variables for both total cohort and covariate subgroups. Odds ratios (OR) determined the utility of each cutoff to discriminate IKDC status. Results: Quadriceps torque LSI (≥69.4%, OR = 3.6), hamstrings torque (≥1.11 Nm/kg, OR = 2.1), and quadriceps power LSI (≥71.4%, OR = 2.0) discriminated between IKDC classification in the total cohort. Quadriceps torque LSI discriminated between IKDC classification in the patellar-tendon graft (≥61.6%, OR = 5.3), hamstrings-tendon graft (≥71.8%, OR = 10.5), and age &lt;18 years (≥74.3%, OR = 5.2) subgroups. Hamstrings torque discriminated between IKDC classifications in the age &lt;18 years (≥1.10 Nm/kg, OR = 2.6) subgroup. Conclusions: Quadriceps torque LSI, hamstrings torque, and quadriceps power LSI were the most useful metrics for predicting normal patient-reported knee function early after ACLR.

To better understand this apparent mismatch, this study explores factors that might predict the school-assigned identification of individuals with dyslexia. Deidentified data on 7,947 second-grade students in 126 schools from one U.S. state included a universal screening measure of literacy skills indicative of dyslexia (i.e., reading and spelling), school-assigned dyslexia classification, and demographic characteristics. As expected, behavioral characteristics of dyslexia from universal screening were associated with school-assigned dyslexia classification. However, dyslexia classification was less likely for minority students and individuals attending schools with a higher percentage of minority students. Students who showed behavioral characteristics of dyslexia and attended schools with a higher proportion of other students with similar poor literacy skills were more likely not to receive a school-assigned dyslexia classification. The findings suggest systematic demographic differences in whether a student is identified with dyslexia by schools even when using universal screening.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0022219420914551",""

Steers were transitioned to a dry-rolled corn-based finishing diet from d 0 to 21 and then were fed the control finishing diet until d 50. Treatment diets were formulated to achieve ≤ 5 ppm (CON), 15 (15PPM), 30 (30PPM), 60 (60PPM), and 90 ppm (90PPM) of total dietary fumonisin. Steers were fed the fumonisin treatment diets from d 50 until harvest on d 160; individual animal body weights were taken on days 0, 50, 100, 150 and 160. Animal performance and carcass data were analyzed using PROC MIXED in SAS with animal as the experimental unit and PROC GLIMMIX was used to analyze categorical carcass data. Contrasts were used to test for linear and quadratic responses. Throughout the study, there was no effect of treatment (P &gt; 0.60), or a linear response (P &gt; 0.16) from increasing fumonisin levels, on BW or DMI. However, CON tended to have lower ADG than the other treatments during the fumonisin treatment period (P = 0.10), and there was a positive linear response (P = 0.02) of ADG to fumonisin dose during the treatment period.

However, these techniques have limited clinical utility. Spectral analysis of the low frequency periodic oscillations in laser Doppler flowmetry‐derived red blood cell flux (i.e., skin flowmotion) is a noninvasive technique that has been used to quantify cutaneous microvascular control mechanisms (e.g., endothelial, neurogenic, myogenic). To date, conclusions regarding the mechanistic regulation of cutaneous microvascular function derived from spectral analysis have been primarily limited to basal conditions. Thus, the aim here was to examine the validity of spectral analysis to quantify sympathetic neural control of skin blood flow during a dynamic physiological stimulus (local skin heating to 42°C). We hypothesized that pharmacological blockade of sensory nerves would reduce the spectral power of the neurogenic frequency band during local heating.

High levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) are observed in several diseases including DN and are a strong prognostic marker for cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes and end-stage renal disease. ADMA, an endogenous endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3) inhibitor, is selectively metabolized by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH). Low DDAH levels have been associated with cardiac and renal dysfunction, but its effects on DN are unknown. We hypothesized that enhanced renal DDAH-1 expression would improve DN by reducing ADMA and restoring NOS3 levels. DBA/2J mice injected with multiple low doses of vehicle or streptozotocin were subsequently injected intrarenally with adenovirus expressing DDAH-1 (Ad-h-DDAH-1) or vector control [Ad-green fluorescent protein (GFP)], and mice were followed for 6 wk. Diabetes was associated with increased kidney ADMA and reduced kidney DDAH activity and DDAH-1 expression but had no effect on kidney DDAH-2 expression. Ad-GFP-treated diabetic mice showed significant increases in albuminuria, histological changes, glomerular macrophage recruitment, inflammatory cytokine and fibrotic markers, kidney ADMA levels, and urinary thiobarbituric acid reactive substances excretion as an indicator of oxidative stress, along with a significant reduction in kidney DDAH activity and kidney NOS3 mRNA compared with normal mice. In contrast, Ad-h-DDAH-1 treatment of diabetic mice reversed these effects. These data indicate, for the first time, that DDAH-1 mediates renal tissue protection in DN via the ADMA-NOS3-interaction. Enhanced renal DDAH-1 activity could be a novel therapeutic tool for treating patients with diabetes.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajprenal.00518.2019",""

Nonlactating, pregnant, multiparous Angus × Hereford cows (n = 104) that conceived during the same fixed-time artificial insemination protocol were assigned to this experiment. Cows were ranked by pregnancy sire (one of two sires), body weight (BW), and body condition score (BCS) on day −15 of the experiment (day 180 of gestation). Cows were then assigned to receive (dry matter basis) 415 g of soybean meal per cow daily in addition to: 1) 195 g/cow daily of CSSO (n = 52) or 2) 170 g/cow daily of CON (n = 52). Cows were maintained in two pastures (26 cows/treatment per pasture) and received daily 12.7 kg/cow (dry matter basis) of grass-alfalfa hay from day −15 to calving. Cows were segregated into 1 of 24 feeding pens three times weekly and received treatments individually from day 0 to calving. Calves were weaned on day 290 of the experiment, preconditioned for 35 d (day 291 to 325), and transferred to a feedyard, where they remained until slaughter (day 514). Cows receiving CSSO and their calves had greater (P &lt; 0.01) plasma concentrations of linoleic acid and total ω-6 PUFA compared with CON after calving. Concentrations of immunoglobulin G in the colostrum and in calf plasma 24 h after birth were greater (P ≤ 0.02) in CSSO vs. CON cattle. Calves from CSSO cows had greater (P ≤ 0.05) expression of adipogenic (adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein and stearoyl-CoA desaturase) and myogenic (myogenic differentiation 1 and myogenin) genes in the longissimus muscle (LM) compared with CON. No treatment differences in birth BW, weaning BW, and final preconditioning BW were noted (P ≥ 0.36). Average daily gain and final BW in the feedyard were greater (P ≤ 0.05) in steers from CSSO cows compared with CON. The incidence of calves diagnosed with BRD that required a second antimicrobial treatment was less (P = 0.03) in calves from CSSO cows, resulting in reduced (P = 0.05) need of treatments to regain health compared with CON. Upon slaughter, LM area was greater (P = 0.03) in calves from CSSO cows compared with CON. Collectively, these results are indicative of programming effects on postnatal offspring growth and health resultant from CSSO supplementation to late-gestating cows. Hence, supplementing CSSO to beef cows during pregnancy might be a feasible alternative to optimize offspring productivity and welfare.","http://academic.oup.com/jas/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jas/skaa247/33649787/skaa247.pdf",""

Our aim is to understand the contextual and personal characteristics that influence patient-consumers’ decisions to trust or ignore information sources about healthcare quality. We use data from Finding Quality Doctors: How Americans Evaluate Provider Quality in the US, 2014, to examine factors that explain trust in sources reporting healthcare quality provided by physicians. Using factor analysis, 3 overarching information sources were identified: (1) employers and healthcare providers; (2) user advocacy sources; and (3) insurance companies and government. We use multiple regression analysis to understand the factors that impact trust in these 3 information sources. Our study found that contrary to previous findings, health status was not a significant factor that affects trust in sources reporting care quality data. Also, age was the only factor that significantly correlated with trusting information from all 3 sources. Specifically, younger adults trusted information from all sources compared to older adults. Furthermore, political affiliation, employment status, income, and area of residence correlated with trusting care quality information from either companies and government agencies or family and social network sources. Results suggest that individual and contextual characteristics are significant factors in trusting information sources regardless of health status and these should be taken into consideration by those promoting public reporting of healthcare quality information.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0046958020952912",""

However, data on continuous albuterol delivery (CAD) via HFNC are lacking. This study quantified CAD via HFNC/vibrating mesh nebulizer (VMN) and large‐volume jet nebulizer (LVN) with face mask (FM) in a pediatric model. Aerosol delivery with two HFNC cannula designs were also compared. Methods: A pediatric manikin was connected to a lung simulator (Vt = 150 mL, RR = 28 breaths/minute, I:E 1:2.4) via collecting filter at the carina. XL Pediatric and SML Adult HFNC designs were tested to determine optimal cannula design for CAD. VMN was placed Before humidifier (37°C), albuterol (5 mg/mL) was nebulized at 3, 6, and 12 L/minute (n = 3). To compare HFNC/VMN with LVN and FM, albuterol (15 mg/hour) was aerosolized for 3 hours/device (n = 3). LVN was connected to FM and filled with 9 mL of albuterol (5 mg/mL) and 66 mL of normal saline to deliver 25 mL/hour at 13 L/minute. VMN was connected to the infusion pump to deliver 7.5 mL/hr of albuterol (2 mg/mL). Drug eluted from filters was assayed with UV spectrophotometry (276 nm). Results: Optimal aerosol delivery occurred at 3 L/minute (12.6% ± 0.5%) with SML Adult HFNC ( Conclusions: Administration of CAD via HFNC/VMN led to a greater than fourfold increase in drug delivery compared to LVN with FM.

The function of osteoderms is further obscured, since there is little histomorphological information on these structures. Indeed, understanding the cellular and molecular events that initiate and drive osteoderm development may clarify the functional significance of these structures. Dubansky & Dubansky (2018) conducted the first histological description of the development of the osteoderm in the American alligator, and identified discrete developmental stages based on the organization of collagen fibers and contributing cell mediators, as well as the degree of mineralization of the matrix. However, questions remain regarding the type of collagen and the identity of the cell precursors that are involved at different stages, as well as the existence of a hyaline cartilage model.

Solferino is so small that Italians from elsewhere in the country will not recognize the name unless you mention the Battaglia (di Solferino), the last engagement of the Second Italian War of Independence. 300,000 soldiers—deployed from the Austrian Empire, the Kingdom of Sardinia, the Kingdom of Hungary, and the Second French Empire—clashed on June 24th, leaving many nations' blood on the Italian hills. With 6,000 soldiers dead and another 40,000 wounded, little did the rulers of that time know the devastating bloodshed at Solferino would inspire one of the largest humanitarian aid programs in the world and bring the once‐battling nations harmoniously together (ICRC, 1998). Henry Dunant was struck by the plight of Solferino veterans and in 1859 founded the Red Cross to provide for victims' families and bring nations together in both war and peace. A century and a half later, over 10,000 volunteers from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), representing seventy‐six nations, gathered in Solferino to memorialize the battle and celebrate Dunant's recognitions. The importance of anthropology represented here is commemorated by the annual unification of nations from all over the world in a common purpose deeply supported by the history of Solferino. Dunant's impact on Solferino has not only brought cultural awareness to the town but has also brought many nations together in universal humanitarianism through his memoir","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/j.sda2.20200700.0002",""

To answer this question, we tested the relationships between a job incumbent’s family life and a co-worker’s work life and found that one person’s family may impact another person’s work. We hypothesized that job incumbent family functioning influences workplace outcomes through work–family balance (WFB) to shape a co-worker’s job attitudes and experiences. Further, we proposed that task interdependence moderates the mediated effects of WFB on the relationship between family functioning and these outcomes. Our sample was 226 married job incumbents living in the United States who work full time, along with responses from both their spouses and co-workers. We found that WFB mediates family functioning’s relationship with the co-worker’s job satisfaction, job incumbent’s incivility, and job incumbent’s task-focused organizational citizenship behaviors. Task interdependence moderated family functioning’s indirect effect on co-worker job satisfaction and the incumbent’s incivility through WFB. There were no significant effects of job incumbent family functioning on co-worker organizational commitment. Thus, family does matter as positive family functioning not only allows the employee to reap the benefit of WFB, but also co-workers benefit through increased job satisfaction and the job incumbent performing more helpful and collegial behavior toward the co-worker.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0018726720930067",""

Social workers are working at the front lines responding to the current COVID-19 pandemic in a variety of health care practice settings, including nursing homes, however it is unclear how social workers perceive their preparedness during this time. This study employed a cross-sectional survey to nursing home social workers via social media on feelings of preparedness for COVID-19, what has been most professionally helpful for social workers during these times in their role in COVID-19, as well as demographic questions. Demographic data were analyzed using SPSS and qualitative data were analyzed using the rigorous and accelerated data reduction (RADaR) technique. Data are based on a sample of 63 (N=63) nursing home social workers. Findings revealed that while some social workers felt prepared for the coronavirus, many respondents stated that they were unprepared to meet the demands and challenges they were facing. Moreover, participants shared that professional support was critically important to get through COVID-19. These findings are important, as social workers are tasked with ensuring each resident attains their highest level of psychosocial well-being, which can be achieved only when nursing home staff are supported. Findings from the present study suggest that additional support for nursing home staff ought to include peer mentoring and mutual support. Additionally, improved leadership across health care settings is worth assessing.","http://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/4/Supplement_1/953/34914939/igaa057.3487.pdf",""

The majority of air conditioning occurs in the nasal passages, where heat and moisture are transferred to inspired air from nasal mucosa via concurrent convection and evaporation. Given that physiological demand for air conditioning is largely dependent on the external environment, many studies have noted strong associations between climate and ecogeographic patterning of human nasal morphology. Specifically, these studies have shown that individuals indigenous to cold‐dry environments exhibit relatively longer/taller/narrower nasal passages than individuals from hot‐humid climates. These apparent climate‐mediated morphologies are assumed to reflect functional differences, with longer/taller/narrower nasal passages in cold‐dry climates enhancing respiratory heat and moisture exchange via increased relative mucosal surface area. However, few attempts to experimentally test these assertions have been made. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to empirically test associations between nasal morphology and air‐conditioning function through both morphometric assessments of 3D morphology using Computed Tomography (CT) imaging and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analyses of nasal airflow. We assessed cranial CT scans of 2 individuals—one of European ancestry and one of West African ancestry. 3D models of the nasal passages were created using 3D Slicer and Mesh Mixer software.

The current study aimed to examine the association between chronic body pain management and cognitive function over time among Chinese older adults. A total of 792 respondents aged 60 and above from urban and rural households in 28 provinces, 150 counties/districts, and 450 communities were selected from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (2013–2015). Cognitive function was measured in three domains: episodic memory, mental status, and global cognitive function. Difference-indifferences approach and mixed-effects linear regression models were employed to assess the association between chronic body pain management and cognitive function over time. Scores of mental status were found to decline slower by 0.49 unit (SE = 0.22, p &lt; 0.05) in respondents who received pain management using analgesics, complementary and alternative medicine, or both from 2013 to 2015 after controlling for basic demographic and health confounders. Chronic pain management was associated with slower decline in domain-specific cognitive function, mental status over time. Findings of the study may contribute to understanding the mechanism of change in diverse cognitive abilities attributable to pain symptoms.

Mean plasma β-hydroxybutyrate concentration was greater (P &lt; 0.01) in BAS vs. CON (3.23 and 2.75 mg/mL; SEM = 0.12). Incidence of BRD was greater (P ≤ 0.05) in BAS vs. CON from days 6 to 10 and days 19 to 23 (treatment × day; P &lt; 0.01), although overall BRD incidence did not differ (P = 0.20) between treatments (82.4% vs. 76.6%, respectively; SEM = 3.2). A greater proportion (P = 0.04) of BAS steers diagnosed with BRD required one antimicrobial treatment to regain health compared with CON (59.3% vs. 47.6%, SEM = 4.2). Hence, BAS administration to steers upon feedlot arrival improved BW gain during a 45-d receiving period by enhancing feed efficiency. Moreover, results suggest that BAS improved steer performance by facilitating early detection of BRD signs, lessening the disease recurrence upon first antimicrobial treatment.","http://academic.oup.com/jas/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jas/skaa339/33932828/skaa339.pdf",""

Our study examined relationships between scores on several personality scales, including the Meaning in Life Questionnaire (Steger et al., 2009) and the WHO-5 Well-Being Index, a proxy measure of mood/depression. Community-dwelling members (N=535) of Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes aged 50 and up (mean age 71.4, SD = 6.93) at 3 U.S. sites completed surveys. Higher wellness levels were significantly correlated with increased resilience, optimism, life satisfaction, and presence of meaning in life, while lower levels were associated with greater searching for meaning in life. A multivariate linear regression model (F = 55.597, df = 4, p = .000, R = .566, R2 = .320) showed that wellness scores increased with higher scores in optimism (ß = .348, p =.000), resilience (ß = .183, p = .000), and presence of meaning in life (ß = .106, p = .019). However, searching for meaning in life significantly predicted decreases in wellness scores (ß = -.084, p=.019). These results support those of previous studies, suggesting that for older persons, an ongoing search for meaning in life is linked to negative outcomes than a perception of existing meaning in life. A variety of available interventions aimed at increasing meaning and purpose in life (Guerrero-Torelles et al., 2017) may contribute to better health and well-being in older adults.","http://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/4/Supplement_1/112/34915665/igaa057.369.pdf",""

Thermal characteristics described by changes in the denaturation temperature (between 55°C – 60°C) and enthalpies of protein denaturation (70°C – 75°C) both differed (P = 0.031 and P = 0.001, respectively) among thick steaks, with thick steaks cooked on a high grill surface temperature having a lower denaturation temperature and enthalpy compared with thick steaks cooked on a low grill surface temperature. No differences (P &gt; 0.05) were observed among thin steaks for denaturation temperature or enthalpy. The elastic behaviors of the surface and center of the steaks were analyzed to determine how the microstructure of the beef responded to applied stress. The elastic behavior of steak centers was influenced in a three-way interaction (P = 0.029) between quality grade, steak thickness, and grill surface temperature. The elastic behavior of the surface of steaks was influenced by the interaction of quality grade and steak thickness (P = 0.031). These interactions, along with the differences in the thermal characteristic of proteins, suggest that the microstructure of steaks was affected by each cooking treatment group. Hardness, resilience, and chewiness were each influenced by a three-way interaction (P = 0.023; 0.014; and 0.030; respectively). Thin steaks possessed greater cohesiveness (P = 0.038) and shear force ( P = 0.007) values. Meanwhile, thin steaks exhibited lower springiness (P = 0.002). The measured alterations in thermal and physical proper- ties in the beef steaks suggest that the composition, thickness, and cooking regiments impact the microstructure of beef, and this was ultimately confirmed through textural measurements. The results of this research can be used in the design of cooking processes that match beef characteristics.","https://www.iastatedigitalpress.com/mmb/article/10916/galley/11002/download/",""

It is associated with different cancers. Our research focuses on studying lung cancer hemimethylation, which refers to methylation occurring on only one of the two DNA strands. Many studies often assume that methylation occurs on both DNA strands at a CpG site. However, recent publications show the existence of hemimethylation and its impact. It is important to identify cancer hemimethylation patterns. Methods: In this paper, we use the Wilcoxon signed rank test to identify hemimethylated CpG sites based on publicly available lung cancer methylation sequencing data. We then identify two types of hemimethylated CpG clusters, regular and polarity clusters, and genes with large numbers of hemimethylated sites. Highly hemimethylated genes are then studied for their biological interactions using available bioinformatics tools. Results: In this paper, we have conducted the first-ever in-depth investigation of hemimethylation for lung cancer. Our results show that hemimethylation does exist in lung cells either as singletons or clusters. Most clusters contain only 2 or 3 CpG sites. Polarity clusters are much shorter than regular clusters and appear less frequently. The majority of clusters found in tumor samples have no overlap with clusters found in normal samples, and vice versa. Several genes that are known to be associated with cancer are hemimethylated differently between the cancerous and normal samples. Furthermore, highly hemimethylated genes exhibit many different interactions with other genes that may be associated with cancer. Hemimethylation has diverse patterns and frequencies that are comparable between normal and tumorous cells. Therefore, hemimethylation may be related to both normal and tumor cell development. Conclusions: Our research has identified CpG clusters and genes that are hemimethylated in normal and lung tumor samples. Due to the potential impact of hemimethylation on gene expression and cell function, these clusters and genes may be important to advance our understanding of the development and progression of lung cancer.","https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-17794/v1",""

However, research points to potential selection bias, in that older adults with key advantages, such as higher wealth, are more likely to volunteer and reap its benefits. As such, we test two competing propositions: Volunteering may act as an equalizer if it benefits the health of the least wealthy the most, or it may further exacerbate disparities if it benefits the health of the wealthiest the most. To that end, we analyzed data from the 2012 and 2014 waves of the Health and Retirement Study (N≈15,000). First, we used relevant covariates (e.g., sociodemographic characteristics, informal volunteering, and health) in 2012 to predict volunteering in 2014, developing the propensity score weights from these results. We then performed several regression analyses to assess the influence of volunteering on self-reported health and depressive symptoms among the general population (ATE) and volunteers themselves (ATT), while comparing the findings for the highest and lowest wealth quintiles. We found that volunteering enhanced self-reported health and reduced depressive symptoms. Further, those in the highest quintile experienced significantly fewer depressive symptoms from volunteering while those in the lowest quintile did not, albeit with no significant differences between the two coefficients. The study enhances the nuanced understanding of volunteering and health while suggesting that unmeasured factors felt strongest among the least wealthy—such as financial distress, discrimination, or lack of organizational support—may attenuate the benefits of voluntary activity.","http://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/4/Supplement_1/36/34915664/igaa057.117.pdf",""

Muscles are composed of two primary fiber types: slow‐twitch (type I) and fast‐twitch (type II).

Here we use a rodent model to examine the plasticity of the masseter muscle fibers in response to inter‐individual variation in dietary material properties.

Despite this progress, a limited consensus exists on the influence of the founder CEO owing to the fragmented nature of extant research. In this review, we address this fragmentation by reviewing current literature, synthesizing the discipline‐specific findings into an integrated framework, and highlighting promising directions for future founder‐CEO research. Research Findings/Insights: Using a cross‐disciplinary review of founder‐CEO research based on 221 articles from 24 academic journals, we synthesize current research and provide directions for future research. Our framework organizes current research on the founder CEO into three broad themes. First, we review and synthesize scholarly work on factors related to the founder CEO during the nascent years of the firm. In the second theme, we review research that explores the impact of the founder CEO on strategic choices and firm configurations. In the third theme, we review the performance consequences of the founder CEO. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This review advances research on the founder CEO by taking stock of insights from various disciplines, highlighting advancements made, and suggesting promising directions for future research on founder CEOs. Additionally, a critical evaluation of current methodological approaches provides opportunities for strengthening the rigor of scholarly inquiry in this area.

While previous studies have outlined the importance of quantifying future flood risk, most have focused on broad aggregations of monetary loss using bathtub SLR-type models. Here we quantify, for the first time at the multi-state scale, actual impacts to coastal communities at the census block level using a dynamic, high-resolution, biogeophysical modeling framework that accounts for future sea-levels and coastal landscapes. We demonstrate that future SLR can increase the number of damaged residential buildings by 600%, the population of displaced people by 500% and the need for shelter assistance of up to 460% from present-day conditions. An exponential increase in flood damage associated with increasing sea level deems it essential for stakeholders to plan for plausible future conditions rather than the current reality.","https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-63173/v1",""

Based on recent evidence that gut dysbiosis may be an early response to stroke, the present study tested the hypothesis that in the acute phase, stroke will result in greater permeability of the gut blood barrier and gut dysbiosis in males as compared to females. Method: Male and female Sprague Dawley rats (5-7 months of age) were subject to endothelin (ET)-1-induced middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). Fecal samples, blood draws and sensory motor tests were conducted pre and 2d after MCAo. Fecal samples were analyzed for 16s sequencing and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Gut permeability was assessed in serum samples using biomarkers of gut permeability as well as functional assays using size-graded dextrans. Results: We confirmed stroke-induced sex differences, including greater mortality and sensory motor deficit in males as compared to age-matched female rats. Remarkably, fecal 16s sequencing showed greater bacterial diversity in females at baseline (prior to stroke) while 2 days after stroke, these measures were similar between the sexes. In contrast, fecal levels of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) which are usually beneficial, were higher in males. MCAo-induced gut permeability was much worse in males as compared to females, as indicated by histological analysis, biochemical markers in serum, and serum measurement of fluorescent-labeled dextrans following oral gavage. Additionally, males had higher serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-17A, MCP-1, IL-5 and EGF compared to females after stroke. Predictive modeling indicated that markers of gut permeability were associated with stroke-induced sensory-motor impairment. Conclusions: Poor stroke outcomes in adult males is mirrored by increased gut permeability in this group. Additionally, these data suggest that constitutive sex differences in the diversity and richness of gut microbial communities may predispose better functional outcomes after stroke in females, and support the idea that preventative modification of the gut microbiome may reduce the risk for stroke in vulnerable populations such as the elderly or those with co-morbid conditions.","https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-50069/v1",""

X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy show the crystallinity of the heterostructure deposited by ALD. After postdeposition annealing of the La-doped STO film in ultrahigh vacuum at 600 °C for 5 min, x-ray photoelectron spectra show the lack of La-dopant activation when the film is deposited on 10 nm-thick BTO.

The current study examined how living alone was related to social contact and emotional well-being among older adults during the pandemic. Adults (N = 226) aged 69+ completed a brief survey assessing their living situation, social contact with different social partners (in person, by phone, electronically), and emotions during the morning, afternoon and evening the prior day. Older adults who live alone were less likely to see others in person or to receive or provide help, and reported less positive emotion the prior day than those who lived with others. Living alone was associated with more positive emotions concurrent with in-person contact. In contrast, phone contact was related to higher levels of negate affect among those living alone, but not among those who live with others. Findings suggest older adults who live alone may be more reactive to social contact during the COVID 19 outbreak than older adults who reside with others. In-person contact appears to confer distinct benefits not available via telephone contact, suggesting that possible interventions during the pandemic may work best with safe forms of in-person contact.","http://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/4/Supplement_1/951/34914026/igaa057.3479.pdf",""

Respondents’ most desired curricular change was for additional instruction in rehearsal planning, error detection and correction, and instrument-specific pedagogy.

In this article, I have three aims. First, I will show that there is a stronger version of one of the arguments against understanding transmission that Malfatti considers, which avoids her objection. This argument also fails, however, and the reason it fails suggests that if understanding cannot be transmitted this is not due to the nature of epistemic trust. Second, I will offer a positive argument for understanding transmission on Malfatti's behalf, and defend the view of understanding on which it depends. Finally, I will raise a further challenge to the proponent of understanding transmission. The upshot is that although Malfatti is right that we have no clear reason to exclude the possibility of understanding transmission – and, if I am right, we have positive reason to accept it – nevertheless a puzzle remains about such transmission.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Ftheo.12263",""

Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is one of the PAH that is generated mainly from cigarette smoke, wood‐burning, automobile exhaust etc. The molecular mechanisms that lead to inflammatory skin diseases following exposure to BaP are not well elucidated, though there are suggestions that these responses could be mediated by aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a xenobiotic sensor. To investigate the effect of BaP exposure on skin inflammation in a mouse psoriatic model, the dorsal skin of naïve C57BL/6 mice was shaved (48h prior to exposure) and exposed to 62.5mg of 5% imiquimod (IMQ) cream once daily for five days. For assessing the initiation or exacerbation of psoriasis from exposure to BaP, mice were exposed 64μg BaP in 50μl acetone for five days before IMQ application [BaP+IMQ] or for five days together with the IMQ [(BaP+IMQ)] application. Following the analysis and scoring of clinical lesions, mice were sacrificed, and skin sections were analyzed for inflammation‐related histopathological and molecular changes. BaP exposure together with IMQ exacerbated IMQ‐induced psoriatic inflammatory lesions including the skin bi‐fold thickness, epidermal and dermal thickness, hyperkeratosis, dermal fibrosis, neutrophil infiltration, neutrophil degeneration and mast cell degranulation. Molecular analysis on the skin samples to further elucidate the effect BaP on IMQ‐induced inflammatory markers such as neutrophil infiltration, macrophages, inflammatory cytokines that could exacerbate psoriasis is being carried out. In other studies, defining the role of AhR in BaP‐induced biological, molecular, and metabolic alterations in mouse skin, concomitant treatment with AhR antagonist CH‐223191 was given before BaP+IMQ treatment. The antagonist treatment before the (BaP+IMQ) treatment abrogated the BaP‐caused increase in epidermal and dermal thickness in psoriatic mice. The effect of the AhR inhibitor on other biological and molecular psoriatic parameters that are exacerbated on exposure to BaP are also being analyzed to decipher the role of AhR in BaP‐induced and/or exacerbation in inflammatory skin diseases like psoriasis.

The research relationship can be viewed as co-constructed by researchers, participants, and communities, but this nature often goes unrecognized because it is confined by the limits of Western epistemology. Dominant Western knowledge systems assume an objective reality or truth that does not support multiple or subjective realities, especially knowledge in which culture or context is important, such as in Indigenous ways of knowing. Alternatives and critiques of the current academic system of research could come from Native conceptualizations and philosophies, such as Indigenous ways of knowing and Indigenous protocols, which are increasingly becoming more prominent both Native and non-Native societies. This paper contains a narrative account by an Indigenous researcher of her personal experience of the significant events of her doctoral research, which examined the narratives of Native Canadian counselors’ understanding of traditional and contemporary mental health and healing. As a result of this narrative, it is understood that research with Indigenous communities requires a different paradigm than has been historically offered by academic researchers. Research methodologies employed in Native contexts must come from Indigenous values and philosophies for a number of important reasons and with consequences that impact both the practice of research itself and the general validity of research results. In conclusion, Indigenous ways of knowing can form a new basis for understanding contemporary health research with Indigenous peoples and contribute to the evolution of Indigenous academics and research methodologies in both Western academic and Native community contexts.","",""

The purpose of the study was to investigate the impact of virtual reality (VR)-generated environments at different virtual heights on postural stability. Methods: Nineteen adults were analyzed for postural stability, tested in real (No VR) environment and in three VR environments, randomly assigned, at virtual heights of 0 ft. (VR0), 40 ft. (VR40), and 120 ft. (VR120). Postural stability was quantified using center of pressure postural sway variables and analyzed using a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Participants also completed a simulation sickness questionnaire (SSQ) before and after VR exposure and a presence questionnaire (PQ) after VR exposure. Findings: Significant postural instability ( p < .05) was identified between VR and No VR, in which increased postural instability was evident in all VR conditions compared with No VR. Scores from SSQ were within a pre–post score difference of five and the PQ score was (104.21 ± 14.03). Conclusion/Application to Practice: Findings suggest that VR environments, regardless of virtual height, induced increased postural instability, which can be attributed to visual sensory conflicts to the postural control system created by VR exposure. Participants’ subjective responses on SSQ and PQ confirmed the feasibility of using VR to represent realistic immersions in virtual heights. However, objectively, VR could potentially lead to postural instability, stressing caution. VR can be a potential tool for providing virtual high-altitude environment exposure for fall prevention training, however, more research is needed on postural adaptation with acute and chronic exposure to VR.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2165079920934000",""

However, for this plant to become economically viable, its oil production needs to be improved. In vivo culture conditions that resemble the development of pennycress embryos in planta were developed based on the composition of the liquid endosperm. Then, substrate uptake rates and biomass accumulation were measured from cultured pennycress embryos, revealing a biosynthetic efficiency of 93%, which is one of the highest in comparison with other oilseeds to date. Additionally, the ratio of carbon in oil to CO2 indicated that non-conventional pathways are likely to be responsible for such a high carbon conversion efficiency. To identify the reactions enabling this phenomenon, parallel labeling experiments with 13C-labeled substrates were conducted in pennycress embryos. The main findings of these labeling experiments include: (i) the occurrence of the oxidative reactions of the pentose phosphate pathway in the cytosol; (ii) the reversibility of isocitrate dehydrogenase; (iii) the operation of the plastidic NADP-dependent malic enzyme; and (iv) the refixation of CO2 by Rubisco. These reactions are key providers of carbon and reductant for fatty acid synthesis and elongation.","http://academic.oup.com/jxb/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jxb/eraa060/32959220/eraa060.pdf",""

In a recent report, we introduced the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) as an index of temporal persistence for such features. Here, we present a novel approach using synthetic features to study which aspects of a biometric identification study are influenced by the temporal persistence of features. What we show is that using more temporally persistent features produces effects on the similarity score distributions that explain why this quality is so key to biometric performance. The results identified with the synthetic data are largely reinforced by an analysis of two datasets, one based on eye-movements and one based on gait. There was one difference between the synthetic and real data, related to the intercorrelation of features in real data. Removing these intercorrelations for real datasets with a decorrelation step produced results which were very similar to that obtained with synthetic features.","https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/16/4555/pdf",""

Whereas this relationship has helped in developing predictions about food web structure and dynamics in mesocosms and simple communities, a trophic‐level–body‐size relationship may not exist for all kinds of communities or taxa, especially those with many non‐carnivorous species. Moreover, functional traits associated with trophic level generally have not been considered. Herein, we examine the correlation between trophic level and body size in fishes and how this relationship may vary in relation to functional traits (body dimensions, mouth size and orientation, tooth shape, gill rakers, and gut length) and trophic guilds (carnivorous vs. non‐carnivorous). We analyzed data from morphological measurements and dietary analyses performed on thousands of specimens from freshwater and estuarine habitats across three zoogeographic regions (Neartic, Neotropical, and Afrotropical). A positive relationship between trophic level and body size was only found for carnivorous fishes. No relationship was found when all species were analyzed together, rejecting the idea that trophic level is positively related with body size in fishes generally. This result was consistent even when using either body mass or standard length as the measure of body size, and trophic level for either species (average values) or individual specimens as the response variable. At the intraspecific level, trophic level varied consistently with size for one third of the species, among which only 40% had positive relationships. Body depth, tooth shape, and mouth width were all associated with the trophic‐level–body‐size relationship. Overall, predators with conical or triangular serrated teeth, large mouths, and elongated/and/or fusiform bodies tend to have positive trophic‐level–body‐size relationships, whereas primarily non‐carnivorous species with unicuspid or multicuspid teeth, deep bodies and small to medium sized mouth gapes tended to have negative relationships. Given the diverse ecological strategies encompassed by fishes, trophic level and food web patterns and processes should not be inferred based solely on body size. Research that integrates multiple functional traits with trophic ecology will improve understanding and predictions about food web structure and dynamics.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fecm.1415",""

Result To enable the analysis of this biologically meaningful feature, we developed a novel bioinformatic toolkit, MetaPrism, which can analyze sequence reads for a set of joint taxa/gene analyses: 1) classify sequence reads and estimate the abundances for taxa-specific genes; 2) tabularize and visualize taxa-specific gene abundances; 3) compare the abundances between groups, and 4) build prediction models for clinical outcome. We illustrated these functions using a published microbiome metagenomics dataset from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy and showed the joint features can serve as potential biomarkers to predict therapeutic responses. Conclusions MetaPrism is a toolkit for joint taxa and gene analysis. It offers biological insights on the taxa-specific genes on top of the taxa-alone or gene-alone analysis. MetaPrism is open source software and freely available at https://github.com/jiwoongbio/MetaPrism.

Design: Prospective blinded study. Animals: Eighteen client‐owned dogs with radiographically confirmed elbow OA. Methods: Videos were obtained for all dogs at a walk and at a trot both prior to and immediately after orthopedic examination. All videos were randomly sequenced. Six observers, unaware of the timing of the video, independently assigned both NRS and VAS twice, with at least a 2‐week interval. Scores were evaluated with mixed analysis of variance, and the agreement among observers was accessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: No difference was detected between NRS and VAS at walk or at trot before and after orthopedic examination. Numeric rating score and VAS at walk were lower than those at trot before an orthopedic examination by scores of 0.17 ( Conclusion: An orthopedic examination did not exacerbate the NRS and the VAS for dogs with elbow OA.

Recent work suggests the possible role of EHF audibility in natural listening environments (e.g., spatial hearing) and hidden hearing loss. In this article, we examine the development of frequency discrimination (FD) in the EHFs. Specifically, the objectives of the present study were to answer if the developmental timeline for FD is different for EHFs; and whether the discontinuity of FD thresholds across frequency—representing the hypothetical shift from a temporal to place code—for children occurs at about the same frequency as adults. Design:: Thirty-one normal-hearing children (5 to 12 years) and 15 young adults participated in this study. FD thresholds were measured for standard frequencies (1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 kHz) and EHFs (10 and 12.5 kHz) using a three-alternative (odd-ball) forced-choice paradigm. Statistical analysis focused on examining the change of FD thresholds as a function of age and estimating the breakpoints in the discrimination threshold-frequency functions. Results:: FD performance in younger children for EHFs was nearly six times poorer relative to older children and adults; however, there was no effect of test frequency on the child-adult difference. Change-point detection on group data revealed a higher knot frequency—representing the putative transition from temporal to place mechanisms—for adults (9.8 kHz) than children (~6 kHz). Individual spline functions suggest that the knot frequency varied from 2 to 10 kHz across participants. Conclusions:: The present study provides evidence for a similar rate of maturation of FD for EHFs and standard frequencies. FD at EHFs matures by 10 to 12 years of age. Adult listeners may not all use temporal cues up to 10 kHz. Young children are relatively inefficient in using temporal fine-structure cues for FD at frequencies above 6 kHz.","https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/AUD.0000000000000972",""

A post hoc analysis of data collected previously (Kayser et al., 2019a) was conducted to investigate differences in immunologic, physiologic, and behavioral responses of steers (N = 36, initial BW = 386 ± 24 kg) that had differential haptoglobin (HPT) responses to an experimentally induced challenge with Mannheimia haemolytica (MH). Rumen temperature, DMI, and feeding behavior data were collected continuously, and serial blood samples were collected following the MH challenge. Retrospectively, it was determined that 9 of the 18 MH-challenged steers mounted a minimal HPT response, despite having similar leukocyte and temperature responses to other MH-challenged steers with a greater HPT response. Our objective was to examine differences in behavioral and physiological responses between MH-challenged HPT responsive (RES; n = 9), MH-challenged HPT nonresponsive (NON; n = 9), and phosphate-buffered saline-inoculated controls (CON; n = 18). Additionally, 1H NMR analysis was conducted to determine whether the HPT-responsive phenotype affected serum metabolite profiles. The RES steers had lesser (P &lt; 0.05) cortisol concentrations than NON and CON steers. The magnitude of the increases in neutrophil concentrations and rumen temperature, and the reduction in DMI following the MH challenge were greatest (P &lt; 0.05) in RES steers. Univariate analysis of serum metabolites indicated differences between RES, NON, and CON steers following the MH challenge; however, multivariate analysis revealed no difference between HPT-responsive phenotypes. Prior to the MH challenge, RES steers had longer (P &lt; 0.05) head down and bunk visit durations, slower eating rates (P &lt; 0.01) and greater (P &lt; 0.05) daily variances in bunk visit frequency and head down duration compared with NON steers, suggesting that feeding behavior patterns were associated with the HPT-responsive phenotype. During the 28-d postchallenge period, RES steers had decreased (P &lt; 0.05) final BW, tended (P = 0.06) to have lesser DMI, and had greater (P &lt; 0.05) daily variances in head down and bunk visit durations compared with NON steers, which may have been attributed to their greater acute-phase protein response to the MH challenge. These results indicate that the HPT-responsive phenotype affected feeding behavior patterns and may be associated with disease resiliency in beef cattle.","http://academic.oup.com/jas/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jas/skaa404/35058925/skaa404.pdf",""

This study develops a deep regression model for predicting the engineering property of asphalt binders based on analysis of atomic force microscopy (AFM) image analysis to test the feasibility of replacing traditional measuring estimate techniques. The base asphalt binder PG 64-22 and styrene–isoprene–styrene (SIS) modifier were blended with four different polymer additive contents (0%, 5%, 10%, and 15%) and then tested with a dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) to evaluate the rheological data, which indicate the rutting properties of the asphalt binders. Different deep regression models are trained for predicting engineering property using AFM images of SIS binders. The mean absolute percentage error is decisive for the selection of the best deep regression architecture. This study’s results indicate the deep regression architecture is found to be effective in predicting the G*/sin δ value after the training and validation process. The deep regression model can be an alternative way to measure the asphalt binder’s engineering property quickly.

Compliant joints and compliant links are two typical solutions to address safety issues for physical human-robot interaction via introducing mechanical compliance to robotic systems. While extensive studies explore variable stiffness joints/actuators, variable stiffness links for safe physical human-robot interactions are much less studied. This paper details the design and modeling of a compliant robotic arm whose stiffness can be continuously tuned via cable-driven mechanisms actuated by a single servo motor. Specifically, a 3D printed compliant robotic arm is prototyped and tested by static experiments, and an analytical model of the variable stiffness arm is derived and validated by testing. The results show that the lateral stiffness of the robot arm can achieve a variety of 221.26% given a morphing angle of 90°.

The layerby-layer manner of AM fabrication significantly expands the vulnerability space of AM cyber-physical systems, leading to potentially altered AM parts with compromised mechanical properties and functionalities. Moreover, internal alterations of the build are very difficult to detect based on traditional geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T) features. Therefore, how to achieve effective monitoring and attack detection is a very important problem for broader adoption of AM technology. To address this issue, this paper proposes to utilize side channels for process authentication. An online feature extraction approach is developed based on autoencoder to detect unintended process/product alterations caused by cyber-physical attacks. Both supervised and unsupervised monitoring schemes are implemented based on the extracted features. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, two real-world case studies are conducted on a fused filament fabrication (FFF) platform equipped with two accelerometers for process monitoring. Two different types of attacks are implemented. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional process monitoring methods, and can effectively detect part geometry and layer thickness alterations in real time.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/MSEC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/MSEC2020-8503/6619195/v002t07a016-msec2020-8503.pdf",""

The paper describes a concrete implementation that leverages answer set programming for determining the evolution of an agent's ``belief state'', based on observations, knowledge about the effects of actions, and a theory about how these influence an agent's beliefs. The beliefs are then used to assess whether statements made by a third party can be accepted as truthful.

To better understand the intersecting patterns of ally behavior, we examined online confrontation behavior by privileged individuals in response to antigay, antitransgender, and racist comments. Study 1 explored rates and types of confrontation during encounters with anti‐Mexican and antigay comments. Study 2 used an experimental design to assess rates and types of confrontation of anti‐Arab and antitransgender comments in the presence of a second confederate who either confronted the prejudice or remained silent. When exposed to anti‐Mexican bias, men were initially more likely to speak up than women, whereas women were more likely to respond to antigay comments. In terms of anti‐Arab and antitransgender bias, social influence resulted in more direct confrontation for anti‐Arab statements and higher rates of confrontation for antitransgender bias. Applying an intersectional lens, patterns of power and privilege reveal gender socialization may impact ally responses to racism and antigay bias. For example, gender socialization and stereotypes equating femininity with gay men may both decrease ally behavior among men and increase confrontation of antigay bias among women. When another potential ally is present, social influence appears to become the most powerful predictor of both whether or not a participant confronts bias and how direct they are with the perpetrator. Intersectional examination of invisible norms for promoting ally confrontation informs development of effective equity and justice interventions.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/josi.12408",""

Here, we found that full recovery was also rapid, with the establishment of a well-developed tiered community within ∼700 k.y. Several stages of recovery were observed, with distinct phases of stabilization and diversification, ending in the development of a trace fossil assemblage mainly consisting of abundant Zoophycos, Chondrites, and Planolites, assigned to the Zoophycos ichnofacies. The increase in diversity is associated with higher abundance, larger forms, and a deeper and more complex tiering structure. Such rapid recovery suggests that favorable paleoenvironmental conditions were quickly reestablished within the impact basin, enabling colonization of the substrate. Comparison with the end-Permian extinction reveals similarities during recovery, yet postextinction recovery was significantly faster after the K-Pg event. The rapid recovery has significant implications for the evolution of macrobenthic biota after the K-Pg event. Our results have relevance in understanding how communities recovered after the K-Pg impact and how this event differed from other mass extinction events.","https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-pdf/48/11/1048/5169389/1048.pdf",""

Existing literature yields inconsistent findings regarding the influence of relationship types on drinking behavior, perhaps because these studies have not accounted for recent changes in the way college students engage in dating/sexual relationships. Methods: The present study sought to address this issue using a longitudinal study design by examining the effects of both relationship type and sexual activity on heavy episodic drinking (HED) among 1,847 college students over the course of the first 3 semesters of college. Results: Results indicated that the effects of relationship type depended on whether an individual was sexually active. Nondating but sexually active students reported rates of HED comparable to students who defined themselves as casual daters. Conversely, nondating students who were not sexually active reported drinking behavior similar to those involved in exclusive relationships. Further, transitions between low‐ and high‐risk relationship/sexual activity types were associated with corresponding changes in HED. Transitioning into a high‐risk relationship was associated with significant increases in levels of HED, whereas transitioning into a low‐risk relationship was associated with significant decreases in HED. Conclusions: Together, results indicate that engaging in nonexclusive dating or casual sexual relationships may play an important role in the development of problematic patterns of alcohol use during the early college years. These findings have potentially important implications both for future research and for prevention and intervention efforts targeting high‐risk college drinkers.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/acer.14347",""

In winter 2017, a large number of atmospheric rivers caused anomalous winter precipitation, near-saturated soils, and a partial melting of snowpack, which led to excessive runoff that damaged the emergency spillway of the Oroville Dam. Given the positive and negative impacts ARs have in California, it is necessary to understand how they will change in a future climate. While prior studies have examined future changes in the frequency of atmospheric rivers impacting the West Coast of the United States, these studies primarily use coarse global climate models that are unable to resolve the complex terrain of this region. Such a limitation is overcome by using a high-resolution convection-permitting regional climate model, which resolves complex topography and orographic rainfall processes that are the main drivers of heavy precipitation in landfalling atmospheric rivers. This high-resolution model is used to examine changes to precipitation and runoff in California’s cool season from 2002 to 2013, particularly in flood-producing storms associated with atmospheric rivers, in a future, warmer climate using a pseudo–global warming approach. In 45 flood-producing storms, precipitation and runoff increase by 21%–26% and 15%–34%, respectively, while SWE decreases by 32%–90%, with the greatest changes at mid-elevations. These trends are consistent with future precipitation changes during the entire cool season. Results suggest more intense floods and less snowpack available for water resources in the future, which should be carefully considered in California’s future water management plans.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jhm/article-pdf/21/11/2607/5014606/jhmd200067.pdf",""

This study identifies parenting profiles indicated by psychological control and decisional autonomy granting and adolescents' acculturation profiles indicated by mainstream American culture and Chinese culture orientations. Background: According to person–environment fit theory, optimal adjustment occurs when there is a match between individuals' environments and needs. However, it remains understudied whether academically gifted Chinese American adolescents have optimal psychosocial adjustment when their acculturation orientation matches with their family's parenting profile. Method: Using self‐report questionnaires, this study assessed 222 academically gifted Chinese American adolescents' perceptions of parental psychological control and autonomy granting, American and Chinese culture orientation, and psychosocial adjustment (depression, anxiety, social acceptance, and self‐esteem). Latent profile analysis was used to identify parenting and acculturation‐orientation profiles. Results: Three parenting profiles were identified: high control oriented (14.9%; i.e., high in psychological control and low in decisional autonomy granting), slight control oriented (44.6%; i.e., psychological control slightly exceeding decisional autonomy granting), and child oriented (40.5%; i.e., low in psychological control and high in decisional autonomy granting). Given that all the adolescents in the sample slightly preferred mainstream American culture to Chinese culture, three levels of parenting–acculturation match were identified: a strong match (for those in child‐oriented families), moderate match (for those in slight‐control‐oriented families), and weak match (for those in high‐control‐oriented families). Conclusion: The adolescents with a strong parenting–acculturation match reported lower anxiety and higher social acceptance and self‐esteem than those with a weak match. Implications: Practitioners working with academically gifted Chinese American adolescents should seek to understand adolescents' acculturation and the parenting practices in their families and acknowledge how their psychosocial problems are associated with a mismatch in adolescent acculturation and parenting.

Selection resulted in 6 treatments: FB high quality, FB low quality, NFB high quality, NFB low quality, US Top Choice, and US Select. Samples were aged 21 d or 35 d postmortem. A subset of 152 samples (12–13 per treatment combination) were used for fatty acid characterization. Within the polar lipid fraction, US treatments had lower monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and greater polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) than NZ treatments (P &lt; 0.05). Within the neutral lipid fraction, concentrations of total neutral lipids and proportions of saturated fatty acid, MUFA, and PUFA were affected by treatment (P &lt; 0.05). Total neutral lipids were greatest in Top Choice (P &lt; 0.05) and greater in FB high quality than all other treatments (P &lt; 0.05). Proportions of satu- rated fatty acid in the neutral lipid fraction were greater in NFB treatments than US treatments (P &lt; 0.05); FB treatments were intermediate. Proportions of MUFA were greatest in Top Choice (P &lt; 0.05). Proportions of PUFA were greatest (P &lt; 0.05) in Select, greater in Top Choice than all NZ treatments (P &lt; 0.05), and greater in NFB treatments than FB treatments (P &lt; 0.05). No interactions occurred for any groups of fatty acids in either fraction ( P &gt; 0.05), and aging did not affect fatty acid composition. Lipid profiles were impacted by finishing diet; however, most differences were between US grain-fed beef and NZ treatments—with limited differences between FB and NFB samples—when product was selected based on quality descriptors.

Importantly, in matched allogeneic and autologous recipients, but not mismatched allogeneic recipients, there was increased stromal derived factor-1 along with increased MSC concentrations in synovial fluid. Until immune recognition of MSCs can be avoided, repeated clinical use of MSCs should be limited to autologous or cross-matched allogeneic MSCs.

Its exposure causes rapid toxicity, severe pain with dermal symptoms including erythema (redness), urticaria, blanching, itching hives, necrosis and systemic effects. Due to its fast penetration, severe dermal injury, and instant lethal toxic effects resulting in high mortality, CX could be weaponized with other chemical threat agents to enhance their deleterious effects. Skin damage with erythema, necrosis and inflammation following cutaneous exposure to CX and vesicants, e.g. sulfur mustard (SM; mustard gas), nitrogen mustard (NM) and lewisite (L), is similar; however, CX also causes severe skin injury with immediate urticaria and blanching as well as mortality. The skin urticaria from CX resembles urticaria caused by allergic and non‐allergic reactions to various environmental substances and can occur alone or can be associated with lethal allergic reaction, anaphylaxis. CX is one of the least studied vesicating agent with no effective treatment available. In the present study, we exposed the dorsal skin of SKH‐1 hairless mice with neat CX for 0.5 and 1.0 min using two 12 mm vapor caps, and studied different parameters associated with its pathophysiology. Clinical data from our study showed that CX exposure leads to acute skin lesions (edema, erythema, necrosis, urticaria and blanching) as well as decreases in heart and respiratory rate, drop in body temperature, vasculature dilation and blood congestion in multiple organs indicating urticaria and anaphylaxis. Histopathological analysis showed a CX‐induced increase of over 2‐fold in the mouse skin epidermal thickness at 2 hr and 14 days following 0.5 min and 1.0 min exposures, respectively. Similarly, 1.5–2.0‐fold increase in dermal plus hypodermal thickening was observed at all study time points following 0.5 and 1.0 min CX exposures. Dermal fibrosis, necrotic blood vessels, hyperkeratosis, cell death and an increase in inflammatory cells was also observed at day 1 and 14 following 0.5 min CX exposure. Edema, necrosis and dying fat cells were observed within 2 hr in the skin of both the CX exposure groups. CX induced an increase in mast cell degranulation within 30 min of its exposure which peaked to over 90% at 24 hr post exposure and was associated with increased histamine and tryptase levels. In addition, an increase in the level of MMP9 and DNA damage maker (pH2AX) in skin tissues was also observed. The results from our completed studies suggest that mast cells could be important players in CX‐ and probably other vesicating agents‐induced toxicity. Hence, molecular markers and cytokines associated with CX‐induced mast cell degranulation as well as inflammatory and DNA damage responses are being evaluated to identify the signaling pathways and key molecular targets for further therapeutic approaches to counteract toxicity from CX cutaneous exposure in case of a chemical emergency.","",""

Evidence of the beneficial role Hip Hop-based approaches can play in this space is growing. The value of such approaches centers on links to community, culture, and the therapeutic potential of practicing certain Hip Hop elements. Yet, while there has been a steady growth in Hip Hop-based approaches, little work has explored how they can overlap, complement, or reinforce each other. In response, this article explores the theoretical synergies between two established Hip Hop-based models – “Hip Hop and Empowerment” (HHE) and “Therapeutic Beat Making” (TBM) – to offer an integrated approach that draws on the complementarity between and uniqueness of each. Findings: Authors identify an integrated HHE–TBM model for supporting youth mental health which forefronts sense of community, cultural relevance, social justice, and empowerment. Authors outline a practice model, which leverages the best of activities, reflections, and discussions, and indicate its potential in working adaptively with diverse communities of young people. Applications: When engaging Hip Hop for therapeutic means, whether for health promotion or complex therapy, it is a dynamic, creative, culturally sensitive, regulating, and developmental means for finding common ground and creating rapport. It bridges creative and insight-oriented practices. It embraces the ability to generate emotional responses from creating and analyzing music, including esthetic emotions (i.e. appreciation (of qualities)), utilitarian emotions (i.e. functional, motivational, relevant to immediate well-being, goal-oriented), and epistemic emotions (i.e. gained knowledge or insight, awareness).","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1468017320911346",""

Metabolomic analyses, for example between healthy, newly infected and diseased or resistant plants, have the potential to reveal perturbations to signaling or output pathways with key roles in determining the outcome of a plant–microbe interaction. However, application of this -omic and its tools in plant pathology studies is lagging relative to genomic and transcriptomic methods. Thus, it is imperative to bring the power of metabolomics to bear on the study of plant resistance/susceptibility. This review discusses metabolomics studies that link changes in primary or specialized metabolism to the defense responses of plants against bacterial, fungal, nematode, and viral pathogens. Also examined are cases where metabolomics unveils virulence mechanisms used by pathogens.

Contextual factors, such as internalized homophobia and connectedness to one's community, have shown to serve as a barrier or facilitator (respectively) with regard to MSM's decisions to seek preventative treatment. These studies, however, predominately feature urban populations, with less consideration given to rural MSM. The current study comparatively investigates these contextual factors between rural and urban MSM to detect differences in the frequency of doctor's visits. Methods: A 2‐by‐2 (rural/urban × doctor visit yes/no) multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted to investigate if significant differences and/or interactions existed for internalized homophobia and community connectedness. Findings: Results show a significant interaction between rurality and doctor's visits in our sample of predominantly white, self‐identified gay men. Higher levels of internalized homophobia and lower levels of community connectedness were seen in rural individuals who had visited a doctor in the past 12 months and in urban individuals who had not seen a doctor in the past 12 months. Conclusions: Study findings have implications for future public health research and for health promotion interventions, practices, and policies for MSM in rural areas. Social exclusion reinforces the invisibility of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) populations, particularly in rural areas. Stigma and marginalization of MSM promote structural barriers inhibiting care.

However, little is known about whether different forms of dating violence behaviors are stable over time or what influences changes in these behaviors. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to use an exploratory autoregressive cross‐lag path model to analyze whether conflict resolution, verbally abusive, and physically abusive behaviors were stable over time and whether these behaviors predicted one another in the future. Method: A total of 285 pregnant or parenting adolescents attending eight high schools in the Southwestern U.S. completed a pre‐test at the beginning of a semester, a follow‐up survey at the end of the semester, and a post‐test at the end of the following semester to longitudinally assess the strategies they used when resolving a conflict with their partners (i.e., conflict resolution strategies, verbally abusive behaviors, and/or physically abusive behaviors). Results and conclusions: An autoregressive cross‐lag model was performed to determine whether conflict resolution, verbally abusive, and physically abusive behaviors at one time point predicted the same variables in the future. Results from the autoregressive cross‐lag model indicated that adolescents’ reports of their conflict resolution strategies and verbally abusive behaviors were stable across time, but their use of physically abusive behaviors were not.

The Multicultural Developmental Supervisory Model (MDSM) is an evidence-based model that focuses on supervisory dyads and multicultural competence [12]. Using the MDSM [12] as a guide reflective of our training, four graduate supervisees share their supervision experiences in learning to conduct clinical interviews in Spanish with undocumented Latinx immigrant minors in government custody in the United States, a rising population with unique clinical considerations. Our supervisor includes her experience in training and fortifying beginning mental health professionals’ skills in conducting these evaluations. In this contribution, we illustrate our trajectory from different training developmental stages, including the process of conceptualizing clinical cases, and transitioning languages in conducting clinical interviews, as well as considering our own cultural identities in clinical work. While our experience focuses on bicultural and bilingual training in the U.S., this aspect of clinical training is growing increasingly relevant around the world, especially in Europe where 54% of the population is multilingual [10].

A well-known and widely believed conjecture says that generically (with respect to perturbations of the periodic potential), the extrema are attained by a single branch of the dispersion relation, are isolated, and have nondegenerate Hessian (i.e., dispersion relations are graphs of Morse functions). The important notion of effective masses in solid state physics, as well as the Liouville property, Green’s function asymptotics, and so on hinges upon this property. The progress in proving this conjecture has been slow. It is natural to try to look at discrete problems, where the dispersion relation is (in appropriate coordinates) an algebraic, rather than analytic, variety. Moreover, such models are often used for computation in solid state physics (the tight binding model). Alas, counterexamples exist even for Schrödinger operators on simple 2D-periodic two-atomic structures, showing that the genericity fails in some discrete situations. We start with establishing in a very general situation the following natural dichotomy: the non-degeneracy of extrema either fails or holds in the complement of a proper algebraic subset of the parameters. Thus, a random choice of a point in the parameter space gives the correct answer “with probability one.” Noticing that the known counterexample has only two free parameters, one can suspect that this might be too tight for the genericity to hold. We thus consider the maximal Z2-periodic two-atomic nearest-cell interaction graph, which has nine edges per unit cell and the discrete “Laplace–Beltrami” operator on it, which has nine free parameters. We then use methods from computational and combinatorial algebraic geometry to prove the genericity conjecture for this graph. Since the proof is non-trivial and would be much harder for more general structures, we show three different approaches to the genericity, which might be suitable in various situations. It is also proven in this case that adding more parameters indeed cannot destroy the genericity result. This allows us to list all “bad” periodic subgraphs of the one we consider and discover that in all these cases the genericity fails for “trivial” reasons only.","http://aip.scitation.org/doi/am-pdf/10.1063/5.0018562",""

Systems-thinking emphasizes taking a holistic “big picture” perspective and understanding how parts of complex processes interact and function. Collectively, the three studies find that systems-thinking can lead to auditors better understanding the risk of material misstatement through improved risk assessment and information processing. Ultimately, these improvements in critical thinking also increase the likelihood of identifying incorrect management explanations and incorporation of comprehensive information into audit decisions. Importantly, these studies find that systems-thinking can be instilled through short tutorial sessions, which may be embedded directly into the audit process.","https://publications.aaahq.org/cia/article-pdf/14/2/P40/56294/i1936-1270-14-2-p40.pdf",""

However, due to resource limitations many mosquito control programs focus attention on one specific component of integrated mosquito control, i.e., adulticiding only. Programs run by public health departments with limited resources are frequently heavily focused on vector control, targeting a few mosquito species that are locally medically relevant in human and animal disease cycles. Focusing their mosquito management on these specific vector species can result in inefficiencies after hurricanes and severe flooding events that create a need for nuisance mosquito control. Floodwater nuisance species that emerge are not routinely a public health threat, but hinder operations related to response efforts and can negatively affect the lives of people in areas recovering from these disaster events. Staff, training, equipment, and facilities, when aimed at public health vector control, may not have the experience, knowledge, or tools to effectively respond to postdisaster, floodwater mosquito populations. As such, all mosquito management programs should have plans in place to handle not only known vectors of public health concern in response to mosquito-borne disease, but also to manage floodwater mosquito populations after natural disasters to safeguard public health and facilitate recovery operations. The current paper discusses the severe weather events in South Texas in 2018 and the resulting integrated nuisance floodwater mosquito control guidance developed by the Texas Department of State Health Services.","http://meridian.allenpress.com/jamca/article-pdf/36/2s/41/2617549/19-6879_1.pdf",""

A novel device using multispectral imaging and artificial intelligence (AI) has shown prior success aiding in this process. Promising initial results of this proof-of-concept case series have been presented previously, invoking much interest from the burn care community. These results reflect the final results of this study and provide support for continued investigation with this device for the treatment of burn wounds. Methods: Subjects with thermal burns were enrolled within 72 hours of injury. The goal was to enroll at least 12 burn wounds from each category of severity: 1°; superficial 2°; deep 2°; and 3°. Upon enrollment burns were imaged with the study device serially for up to 7 days post-burn. The true healing potential of each imaged burn area was determined using either healing assessment at 21 days post-burn or multiple punch biopsies of the burn wound taken at time of excision and grafting. This ground truth was used to train the AI algorithm to automatically identify the margins of non-healing burn tissue within device images. Accuracy of the study device to identify and differentiate healing and non-healing burn tissue within the captured wound area was computed. Results: Data from 38 subjects with 58 total burns and 393 wound images were obtained during this study. Following completion of training, AI predictions achieved 90.7% sensitivity with 87.5% specificity in predicting non-healing burn tissue using cross-validation. Results improved throughout the study as more wound images were used in AI training (Figure 1). Conclusions: The AI algorithm trained on 58 burn wounds (38 subjects) had an area under the curve of 0.955 and has continued to improve with the addition of more burn wounds. Expansion of this study has been initiated at multiple burn centers to continue collecting data for AI algorithm training. Applicability of Research to Practice: These results demonstrate feasibility of utilizing AI-assisted diagnosis in burn wounds and possible application in the management of burn patients.","http://academic.oup.com/jbcr/article-pdf/41/Supplement_1/S60/32763153/iraa024.095.pdf",""

Use of person-centered assessment tools in individuals with autism to explore social communication may facilitate improved consideration of perspectives of individuals with autism, which is critical for developing interventions and supports that align with their perspectives and values. An assessment process called the repertory grid can be used to explore one’s personal construction systems as they relate to social relationships.

Traditionally, non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) involving the breast are divided into primary lymphoma of the breast and systemic lymphoma, although the distinction could be challenging. Most of NHL involving breast tissue have B cell origin; T cell NHL represents less than 20% of all lymphoma cases. Anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL) involving the breast accounts for even lower percentage of cases. Similar to ALCL involving other sites, there are several main types of ALCL identified: primary cutaneous ALCL and systemic ALCL, which is subdivided into ALK positive and ALK negative subtypes. Relatively recently, an additional distinct subtype of ALK-negative ALCL was described, which is associated with textured breast implants and needs to be considered as a differential diagnosis if patient has a history of breast implants.

The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of acute PWS ingestion to improve hemodynamic responses, cognitive function, and exercise performance in resistance‐trained males. METHODS: We recruited eight apparently healthy resistance‐trained males with at least six months immediate prior history of resistance training (19±1.1 yr, 173±2.6 cm, 66±2.9 kg, and 13.6±3% body fat) to participate in a randomized, double‐blind, crossover, and placebo‐controlled manner. We instructed participants to maintain their current diet and training regimens throughout the study. Supplements were a 6.5 g maltodextrin placebo (PL) and a commercially available PWS containing 1.6 g beta‐alanine, 1.0 g creatine nitrate, 1.0 g arginine alpha‐ketoglutarate, 321 mg explosive energy blended (including 160 mg caffeine anhydrous, l‐tyrosine, Tea Cor, tetramethyluric acid), 250 mg ascorbic acid, 30 mg niacinamide, 500 mcg vitamin B6, 150 mcg folate, and 20 mcg vitamin B12. In the first and second testing sessions interspersed with a seven‐day washout period, heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and visual and auditory reaction time (RT) were measured immediately before and 30 min after ingesting the assigned supplement (i. e., at minutes 10, 20, and 30). Then, the exercise testing protocol was initiated, and strength was assessed as a bench and leg press volume, defined as repetitions to fatigue during set three following two sets of 10 reps at 70% of 1RM for each lifting movement. Additionally, the Wingate test was performed to measure the anaerobic peak and mean power. Repeated‐measures ANOVA, Bonferroni test, and Student’s t‐test were used to analyze data. Results are expressed as mean±SD. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in the HR, SBP, and DBP at any point between treatments (p>0.05). There were also no significant differences in the visual and auditory RT at any point between PWS and PL treatments (p>0.05). Nevertheless, a significant improvement was seen in the bench press (PL 1,313±186 kg; PWS 1,463±238 kg, p=0.001), and the leg press performances only in the PWS, not the PL treatment (PL 5,566±616 kg; PWS 6,212±503 kg, p=0.001). Moreover, there was a significant improvement in the Wingate peak power (PL 906±40 Watt; PWS 993±52 Watt, p=0.001) and mean power (PL 473±42 Watt; PWS 510±31 Watt, p=0.001) after ingesting the PWS. The percent changes by ingesting the supplement were 12.62%, 12.66%, 9.61%, and 8.15% for bench press, leg press, peak power, and mean power, respectively. CONCLUSION: The PWS formula used in this study appears to improve exercise performance, but did not affect hemodynamic responses and cognitive function. It may suggest that a more extended period of study is necessary to determine the potential ergogenic benefits of such a supplement regimen on hemodynamic responses and cognitive function.","",""

There are moves that one can apply to plabic graphs, and thus to maximal weakly separated collections, analogous to mutations of seeds in cluster algebras. In this short note, we show if two maximal weakly separated collections can be mutated from one to another, then one can do so while freezing the face labels they have in common. In particular, this provides a new, and we think simpler, proof of Postnikov's result that any two reduced plabic graphs with the same decorated permutations can be mutated to each other.","https://dmtcs.episciences.org/6389/pdf",""

This concern compels us to seek more impactful and long-term solutions to the issues surrounding motivation and retention of underrepresented students in STEM disciplines. It is imperative that we increase our capability to effectively identify, recruit, and retain underrepresented students within the STEM pipeline. Focusing on identity development as the first of these critical capacities, a case study was conducted to determine if any central characteristics exist that shape the STEM self-concept and identity of four gifted, Black male students who were recent graduates from a predominantly Black, Title 1 high school within a southern, rural region of America. Two 90-min, audio-recorded interviews were conducted with a follow-up focus group discussion a year later. Their experiences were told in retrospect, narrated using their perspectives as they related to their “life” and “STEM” stories. The data revealed STEM identity development very much connected to race, cultural values, and contextual STEM environment. Exploring the dynamics of development surrounding motivation, this article highlights their STEM success to better understand how their STEM talent was developed. Their stories, common themes, and implications for educators are discussed followed by a call for further research.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1076217520940767",""

However, evidence to support this practice is weak, and it might exacerbate dysbiosis and inflammation. Hypothesis/Objectives: To evaluate the effect of carprofen alone or combined with omeprazole in dogs. We hypothesized that coadministration of omeprazole and carprofen would significantly increase GI permeability and dysbiosis index (DI) compared to no treatment or carprofen alone. Animals: Six healthy adult colony beagle dogs. Methods: Gastrointestinal permeability and inflammation were assessed by serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentration, plasma iohexol concentration, fecal DI, and fecal calprotectin concentration in a prospective, 3‐period design. In the first 7‐day period, dogs received no intervention (baseline). During the 2nd period, dogs received 4 mg/kg of carprofen q24h PO for 7 days. In the 3rd period, dogs received 4 mg/kg of carprofen q24h and 1 mg/kg of omeprazole q12h PO for 7 days. Gastrointestinal permeability testing was performed at the end of each period. Data were analyzed using repeated measures mixed model analysis of variance with Tukey‐Kramer post hoc tests ( Results: Serum LPS and plasma iohexol concentrations did not differ between treatments.

In turn, insights regarding urban activity patterns have been used to motivate alternative residential neighbourhood measurement strategies incorporating dimensions of activity space in the form of egocentric neighbourhoods – measurement approaches that place individuals at the centre of their own residential neighbourhood units. Unexamined, however, is the extent to which the boundaries of residents’ own self-defined residential neighbourhoods compare with census-based and egocentric neighbourhood measurement approaches in aligning with residents’ routine activity locations. We first assess this question, examining whether the boundaries of residents’ self-defined residential neighbourhoods are in closer proximity to the coordinates of a range of activity location types than are the boundaries of their census and egocentric residential neighbourhood measurement approaches. We find little evidence that egocentric or, crucially, self-defined residential neighbourhoods better align with activity locations, suggesting a division in residents’ activity locations and conceptions of their residential neighbourhoods. We then examine opposing hypotheses about how self-defined residential neighbourhoods and census tracts compare in socioeconomic and racial composition. Overall, our findings suggest that residents bound less segregated neighbourhoods than those produced by census geography, but self-defined residential neighbourhoods still reflect a preference towards homophily when considering areas beyond the immediate environment of their residence. These findings underscore the significance of individuals’ conceptions of residential neighbourhoods to understanding and measuring urban social processes such as residential segregation and social disorganisation.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0042098020966262",""

Forty Holstein steers were administered an i.v. bolus dose of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH; 0.1 IU/Kg BW) to mimic an acute pre-mortem stress. Longissimus lumborum (LD) biopsy samples were taken prior to the ACTH challenge. Serum cortisol was measured every 0.5 h from -2 to 6 h relative to the ACTH challenge. Skeletal muscle and blood samples from 10 steers were collected at each harvest timepoint at (2, 12, 24 and 48 h post-challenge). Samples were collected from the LD immediately after harvest and after 14 d of aging. Protein expression of HSPβ1, P-HSPβ1, HSPβ5, and DJ-1 was analyzed in muscle samples taken prior to the ACTH challenge, at harvest, and after 14 d of post-mortem wet aging. In addition, steak color and myofibrillar fragmentation index (MFI) was analyzed in 14 d aged samples.

We used joinpoint regression and unadjusted Poisson regression to evaluate temporal trends. Finally, we computed adjusted Poisson models to evaluate whether temporal trends were evident after accounting for changes in the population distributions of maternal/infant characteristics over time. Results: Relative to all live births in the general population, cases were more frequently male or preterm. Mothers of cases were more frequently non‐Hispanic white and more frequently obese.

Health disparities among racial and ethnic minorities result from inaccurate assessment in primary care. Methods: The current study used baseline data from two federally funded research studies of treatment for depression among Hispanics in primary care. The Patient Health Questionnaire‐9 (PHQ‐9) was administered at baseline prior to the study interventions, and 499 participants provided responses. Results: Confirmatory factor analyses found excellent factor validity for the PHQ‐9, yet reliability remained poor. Possible heterogeneity in depressive item scores was examined, and latent profile analysis identified four distinct profiles of PHQ‐9 responses. Profiles included a lower depression, moderate/somatization, moderate/negative self‐view, and severe depression profiles. Results indicate modest support for the PHQ‐9 and its use among Hispanics for the purpose of depression screening. Conclusion: Capturing four profiles of depression in a large primary care sample helps characterize the manifestation of depression in a Hispanic population.

This revealed that males showed statistically significant expansion of a region of the hypothalamus, while females showed significant expansion in a distributed set of regions, including the cerebellum, early visual cortex, and higher‐order visual regions spanning occipital and temporal cortex. In order to elucidate the network connectivity of these regions, we employed probabilistic tractography on diffusion tensor imaging data. This showed that the female‐enlarged regions connect with distributed association networks across the brain. Notably, this contrasts with rodent studies, where sex differences are focused in deep, ancestral limbic regions involved in the control of reproductive behavior. Additionally, in our data set, for several regions, male and female volumetric measures were completely nonoverlapping. This contrasts with human studies, where sex differences in cortical regions have been reported but are characterized by overlapping rather than divergent male and female values. We suggest that these results can be understood in the context of the different lifetime experiences of males and females, which may produce increased experience‐dependent cortical plasticity in capuchins compared to rodents, and in humans compared to capuchins.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fcne.24950",""

OMC has been shown to have potent in vitro activity against a broad-spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, as well as Nontuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM). Due to it’s unique activity and availability as an oral agent, off-label use of OMC has been increasing. We evaluated the real-world effectiveness and safety of OMC for a variety of infections. Methods: This was a multicenter, retrospective, observational study that was conducted from January 2020 to June 2020. We included all patients ≥ 18 years of age that received OMC for ≥ 72 hours for any indication and/or pathogen. The primary outcome was clinical success, defined as a lack of 30-day (non-NTM) or 90-day (NTM) mortality or microbiologic recurrence and absence of therapy escalation or alteration. Reasons for OMC utilization and incidence of potential adverse effects attributable to OMC were also analyzed. Results: A total of 18 patients were included from six geographically distinct academic health systems (median age: 56 (IQR, 49-60.5) years; 61% male; 72% Caucasian). The majority of OMC use was in NTM (61%; 100% Mycobacterium abscessus) and in Acinetobacter baumannii (22%) for bone/joint (39%) and respiratory tract (33%) infections. OMC was used primarily in the outpatient setting alone (83%) and most isolates did not have OMC susceptibility conducted (89%). Clinical success was reported in 83% of the total population (71% non-NTM and 91% NTM). The majority of patients were prescribed OMC due to antimicrobial resistance to previous antibiotic(s) (61%) and/or due to OMC’s availability as an oral agent (44%). Three patients experienced side effects while on therapy (serum creatinine elevation, AST/ALT increase, and gastrointestinal distress). Conclusion: OMC appears to be effective and well-tolerated for a variety of infections caused by various pathogens, including M. abscessus and A. baumannii. Disclosures: Michael J.

With respect to skeletal traits, little is known about the gene regulation underlying these hard tissues or how tissue‐specific patterns are associated with bone morphology or vary among species. To begin exploring these topics, this study evaluates one epigenetic mechanism, DNA methylation, in skeletal tissues from five nonhuman primate species which display anatomical and locomotor differences representative of their phylogenetic groups. Materials and Methods: First, we test whether intraspecific variation in skeletal DNA methylation is associated with intraspecific variation in femur morphology. Second, we identify interspecific differences in DNA methylation and assess whether these lineage‐specific patterns may have contributed to species–specific morphologies. Specifically, we use the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip to identify DNA methylation patterns in femur trabecular bone from baboons ( Results: Significant differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were associated with a subset of morphological variants, but these likely have small biological effects and may be confounded by other variables associated with morphological variation. Conversely, several species–specific DMPs were identified, and these are found in genes enriched for functions associated with complex skeletal traits. Discussion: Overall, these findings reveal that while intraspecific epigenetic variation is not readily associated with skeletal morphology differences, some interspecific epigenetic differences in skeletal tissues exist and may contribute to evolutionarily distinct phenotypes. This work forms a foundation for future explorations of gene regulation and skeletal trait evolution in primates.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fajpa.24041",""

The purpose of this study was to quantitatively compare the SO and CMC estimates of muscle activations and forces during gait with the experimental data in the Gait2392 and Full Body Running models. In OpenSim (version 3.1), muscle function during gait was estimated using SO and CMC in 6 subjects in each model and validated against experimental muscle activations and joint torques. Experimental and simulated activation agreement was sensitive to optimization technique for the soleus and tibialis anterior. Knee extension torque error was greater with CMC than SO. Muscle forces, activations, and co-contraction indices tended to be higher with CMC and more sensitive to model choice. CMC’s inclusion of passive muscle forces, muscle activation-contraction dynamics, and a proportional-derivative controller to track kinematics contributes to these differences. Model and optimization technique choices should be validated using experimental activations collected simultaneously with the data used to generate the simulation.","https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/jab/36/4/article-p259.xml",""

However, more than one‐third of U.S. engineering doctorates enter industry. Purpose: Our purpose is to understand engineering graduate students' interest in industry, academia, and government careers as it relates to their graduate engineering identities. Design/Method: A total of 249 engineering thesis master's and doctoral students completed a survey about their graduate engineering identities and career preferences. We created regression models to predict students' likelihood of pursuing careers in industry, academia, and government. Then, we used cluster analysis to understand the extent to which students are considering multiple options and used chi‐squared and ANOVA tests to compare the clusters. Results: In the regression model predicting an academic career, research recognition and research performance/competence were positive predictors and engineering performance/competence was a negative predictor. Regression models of industry and government described less than 10% of the variance. Four clusters emerged, which collectively demonstrate that engineering graduate students are considering careers in multiple sectors. Students with internships during graduate study were more likely to pursue industry careers. Master's students were underrepresented in the cluster with highest likelihood of an academic career. International students were keeping more options open than some domestic students. There were also differences by engineering discipline. Conclusions: Engineering graduate students are considering multiple career sectors.

Variation in environmental quality may affect an organism’s physiological health and, ultimately, survival and fitness. Using multiple health measures can aid in identifying populations at increased risk of declines. Our objective was to measure environmental variables at multiple spatial scales and their effect on three indicators of health in ornate chorus frog (Pseudacris ornata) tadpoles to identify potential correlates of population declines. To accomplish this, we measured a glucocorticoid hormone (corticosterone; CORT) profile associated with the stress response, as well as the skin mucosal immune function (combined function of skin secretions and skin bacterial community) and bacterial communities of tadpoles from multiple ponds. We found that water quality characteristics associated with environmental variation, including higher water temperature, conductivity and total dissolved solids, as well as percent developed land nearby, were associated with elevated CORT release rates. However, mucosal immune function, although highly variable, was not significantly associated with water quality or environmental factors. Finally, we examined skin bacterial diversity as it aids in immunity and is affected by environmental variation. We found that skin bacterial diversity differed between ponds and was affected by land cover type, canopy cover and pond proximity. Our results indicate that both local water quality and land cover characteristics are important determinants of population health for ornate chorus frogs. Moreover, using these proactive measures of health over time may aid in early identification of at-risk populations that could prevent further declines and aid in management decisions.","http://academic.oup.com/conphys/article-pdf/8/1/coaa047/33687505/coaa047.pdf",""

Limited research, however, has evaluated whether FWS participation improves academic success among students attending community colleges. Purpose and Research Questions: The purpose of this study was to determine whether and how FWS participation impacted academic performance and enrollment outcomes among a racially/ethnically diverse sample of students attending a large, urban community college (UCC) system in Texas. There were two research questions: (1) What are the characteristics of students at UCC who participated in FWS, compared with their peers who did not participate? (2) After controlling for self-selection bias, are there significant differences in academic success (i.e., cumulative GPA; credential attainment and/or four-year transfer) among UCC students who did and did not participate in the FWS program? Research Design: The longitudinal data set (fall 2010 through summer 2016) analyzed in this study was built using detailed student-level transcript data records. The full sample included 8,837 students who had filed a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (a necessary step to receive FWS funding), but the primary focus was on the subsample of FWS participants (n = 260). Descriptive analysis was performed to compare the demographic and academic characteristics of FWS participants with nonparticipants. To assuage self-selection bias, propensity score matching (nearest neighbor matching algorithm) was used to match similar students who did and did not participate in FWS. We employed multiple regression and logistic regression techniques on the matched data to investigate whether FWS participation was associated with students’ academic outcomes. Results: Relative to their non-FWS peers, FWS participants at this community college were more likely to be female, African American, 24 years of age or older, very low income, and academically underprepared. After successfully matching FWS participants with similar non-FWS participants, results indicated that FWS participation was associated with a higher cumulative GPA and significantly higher odds of credential completion and/or vertical transfer. Conclusions: There are important equity implications in our findings; the results suggest that the FWS program can improve educational outcomes for student populations that are often marginalized and underserved by the higher education system. We describe several ways that the FWS program could be redesigned and expanded to better meet the needs of community college students.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/016146812012200111",""

Panobinostat, which is a pan-HDAC inhibitor, is an FDA-approved drug for certain cancers, whereas entinostat is a class-I HDAC inhibitor and is widely expected to get approval for clinical use in near future. Stroke was induced by photothrombosis and the drugs were administered intraperitoneally every other day (panobinostat at 10 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg; entinostat at 5 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg) starting from day 5 to day 15 after stroke. The control group received only vehicle following the same regimen. In addition, all drug or vehicle-treated mice exercised for 2 hours (voluntary wheel running) starting from day 9 to day 41 after stroke. Additional control groups included sham-operated animals, and mice which had stroke but were not drug/vehicle-treated or allowed to run. Motor function of the mice was evaluated by blinded investigators using gridwalk and cylinder tests before and after stroke. Acetylation of histone 3 in the peri-infarct region of the brain samples was measured by immunoblotting. Our results indicate that lower dose of both panobinostat and entinostat marginally improved motor function in mice by day 42 after stroke, although it did not reach statistical significance. Notably, this improvement trend was lost with the higher dose of both drugs which also showed some toxicity. No statistical difference was observed in running distance of mice among experimental groups. Likewise, we did not observe statistically significant difference in stroke volumes among the experimental groups. Immunoblotting experiments indicated that both panobinostat and entinostat dose-dependently increased the level of acetylated histone in the cortical, peri-infarct region of drug-treated animals compared to the non-treated groups. In summary, our results indicate that both panobinostat and entinostat do not facilitate improvement of motor function after stroke at the tested doses. However, it is likely that lower doses of these drugs may enhance recovery of motor function after stroke.","http://journals.lww.com/00007670-202002001-00556",""

Most lists of pronunciation errors for speakers of a particular first language (L1) are based on the experience of expert linguists or teachers of English as a second language (ESL) and English as a foreign language (EFL). Such lists are useful, but they are also subject to blind spots for less noticeable errors while suggesting that other more noticeable errors are more important. This exploratory study tested whether using a database of read sentences would reveal recurrent errors that had been overlooked by expert opinions. We did a systematic error analysis of advanced L1 Arabic learners of English ( n = 4) using L2 Arctic, a publicly available collection of 1,132 phonetically-balanced English sentences read aloud by 24 speakers of six language backgrounds. To test whether the database was useful for pronunciation error identification, we analysed Arabic speakers’ sentence readings ( n = 599), which were annotated in Praat for pronunciation deviations from General American English. The findings give an empirically supported description of persistent pronunciation errors for Arabic learners of English. Although necessarily limited in scope, the study demonstrates how similar datasets can be used regardless of the L1 being investigated. The discussion of errors in pronunciation in terms of their functional loads (Brown, 1988) suggests which persistent errors are likely to be important for classroom attention, helping teachers focus their limited classroom time for optimal learning.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1362168820931888",""

This is especially problematic in urban slums where people are more vulnerable to sanitation-related diseases compared with rural areas because of their high population density. We explore why latrines are not being used even when they are available to slum dwellers by identifying social interactions that serve as information channels that promote public latrine use. Using an original survey in New Delhi, we find that slum dwellers who frequently interact with slum leaders, more so than other community leaders, are more likely to use nearby public latrines regularly. A survey of slum leaders finds that their role in fixing and maintaining public latrines and informing others of these acts as well as educating people on hygiene encourage public latrine use.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0042098020911824",""

Objective: The aim of the present study was to use observational methods to examine coparenting process in 52 families of four (mother–father–older child–younger child; Method: Mothers' and fathers' support of their partner and involvement with both children were examined in relation to the mothers' and fathers' cooperative coparenting. Observations were of 25‐minute home interactions that were rated using a newly developed coding system based on previous research with families of three. Results: Results largely replicated findings from studies of coparenting in families of three (i.e., two parents and one child) in that higher levels of cooperative coparenting were related to both parents' higher involvement in coparenting and mutual support of their partner. However, significant interaction effects in families with two children revealed cooperative coparenting as more nuanced than in families with one child. Interactions indicated that cooperative coparenting was highest when both parents' involvement was high. Cooperative coparenting was lowest when both parents showed low support for one another, as well as when mothers showed low support of fathers and fathers showed low involvement. Conclusions: Results of this study reveal several commonalities in the coparenting of one child versus two children, as well as several notable differences. Results suggest that cooperative coparenting of two children may often require “all hands on deck” to provide adequate attention and resources for two young lives. Our findings also suggest that cooperative coparenting can still occur when one parent shows low behavioral support of the other or when a father's involvement is low, as long as the partner is highly supportive.

Experimental Design:: Bioluminescence imaging, reverse phase protein array proteomics, fluorescence microscopy, reporter assays, and molecular biology approaches were used to evaluate NOTCH signaling. Orthotopic glioma-mouse models were utilized to evaluate effects in vivo. Results:: We have identified that herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1; oncolytic and wild-type)-infected glioma cells induce NOTCH signaling, from inside of infected cells into adjacent tumor cells (inside out signaling). This was canonical NOTCH signaling, which resulted in activation of RBPJ-dependent transcriptional activity that could be rescued with dnMAML. High-throughput screening of HSV-1–encoded cDNA and miRNA libraries further uncovered that HSV-1 miR-H16 induced NOTCH signaling. We further identified that factor inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH-1) is a direct target of miR-H16, and that FIH-1 downregulation by virus encoded miR-H16 induces NOTCH activity. FIH-1 binding to Mib1 has been reported, but this is the first report that shows FIH-1 sequester Mib1 to suppress NOTCH activation. We observed that FIH-1 degradation induced NOTCH ligand ubiquitination and NOTCH activity. REMBRANDT and The Cancer Genome Atlas data analysis also uncovered a significant negative regulation between FIH-1 and NOTCH. Furthermore, combination of oHSV with NOTCH-blocking gamma secretase inhibitor (GSI) had a therapeutic advantage in two different intracranial glioma models treated with oncolytic HSV, without affecting safety profile of the virus in vivo. Conclusions:: To our knowledge this is the first report to identify impact of HSV-1 on NOTCH signaling and highlights the significance of combining oHSV and GSI for glioblastoma therapy.","https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article-pdf/26/10/2381/2057974/2381.pdf",""

TFZs have freshwater chemistry and tidal physics, and yet are neither river nor estuary based on classic definitions. Such zones have been occasionally discussed in the literature but lack a consistent nomenclature and framework for study. This work proposes a measurable definition for TFZs based on three longitudinal points of interest: (1) the upstream limit of brackish water, (2) the upstream limit of bidirectional tidal velocities, and (3) the upstream limit of tidal stage fluctuations. The resulting size and position of a TFZ is transient and depends on the balance of tidal and riverine forces that evolves over event, tidal, seasonal, and annual (or longer) timescales. The concept, definition, and transient analysis of TFZ position are illustrated using field observations from the Aransas River (Texas, USA) from July 2015 to July 2016. The median Aransas TFZ length was 59.9 km, with a late summer maximum of 66.0 km and a winter minimum of 53.6 km. The TFZ typically (annual median) began 11.8 km upstream from the river mouth (15.4 km winter/11.2 km summer medians) and ended 71.7 km upstream (69.0 km/77.2 km). Seasonally low baseflow in the Aransas River promoted gradual coastal salt encroachment upstream, which shortened the TFZ. However, sporadic large rainfall/runoff events rapidly elongated the TFZ. The TFZ definition establishes a quantifiable framework for analyzing these critical freshwater systems that reside at the nexus of natural and human‐influenced hydrology, tides, and climate.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2019WR026619",""

However, consumer happiness with products typically declines over time, a process called “hedonic adaptation.” Understanding this process is essential for managing consumers' post‐acquisition experiences, and yet marketers have not explored how the ubiquitous social environment influences hedonic adaptation. We explore the effect of a social audience (i.e., the presence of others and the perception that those others are noticing you) on adaptation to positive products using two real‐world studies and one lab study. We show that a social audience can slow hedonic adaptation by cuing consumers to believe that others are admiring their product. This perceived admiration, in turn, helps consumers see the product through fresh, unadapted eyes. These findings help clarify the role of the consumption environment in adaptation, help explain why product happiness can vary by consumer over time, and show that the effects of social forces do not always occur at the moment of product acquisition.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/mar.21401",""

Background: Prior research has focused on factors associated with unsuccessful reunification instead of resilient family processes that may support successful reunification. How custodial grandfamilies navigate reunification has not been examined, despite their unique relational configuration and grandparents' frequent involvement in raising their grandchildren. Method: Guided by Walsh's model of family resilience, semistructured, in‐depth qualitative interviews were conducted with a convenience sample of 17 grandmothers whose custodial grandchildren had been reunified with a biological parent. Data analysis was guided by grounded theory methodology. Results: Grandmothers believed in parents fulfilling their obligations, prioritizing grandchildren's needs, and coping via their faith. Grandmothers supported reunified parents and children by providing emotional support and instrumental assistance, while maintaining clear role boundaries. Accessing resources and engaging in open family communication were helpful to the reunification, although there were still challenges in navigating family relationships. Conclusion: Within custodial grandfamilies, not all reunifications were a positive outcome for the grandchildren. Grandmothers remained heavily involved in supporting and monitoring the reunifications, with the quality of the grandmother–parent relationship being paramount.

According to the DE model, the course of treatment follows the shape of a negatively accelerating curve, even though each session of psychotherapy is conceptualised as providing an equivalent dose of treatment. In contrast, the GEL model suggests that there is a linear relationship between psychotherapy response and treatment length that is idiographic for each client, depending on the number of sessions attended. The aim of the current study was to compare these two models in a sample of 399 adult psychotherapy clients. Session‐by‐session outcome was tracked using the Outcome Questionnaire‐45.2 in tandem, and multilevel modelling was used for the analyses. Results indicate that the DE model fits the data better than the GEL model, although the difference in model fit was small. Support for the DE model over the GEL model was further evident in a subsample of prototypical clients—that is, those who did not experience problems with the therapeutic alliance, social support or stressful life events. Findings from the present study add to the existing literature comparing the DE and GEL models and have implications on outcome monitoring in psychotherapy services.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fcapr.12337",""

Though seldom designed to elucidate genetic mechanisms, MET data sets are often much larger than could be duplicated for genetic research and, given proper interpretation, may offer valuable insights into the genetics of adaptation across time and space. The Cooperative Dry Bean Nursery (CDBN) is a MET for common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) grown for &gt; 70 years in the United States and Canada, consisting of 20–50 entries each year at 10–20 locations. The CDBN provides a rich source of phenotypic data across entries, years, and locations that is amenable to genetic analysis. To study stable genetic effects segregating in this MET, we conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using best linear unbiased predictions derived across years and locations for 21 CDBN phenotypes and genotypic data (1.2 million SNPs) for 327 CDBN genotypes. The value of this approach was confirmed by the discovery of three candidate genes and genomic regions previously identified in balanced GWAS. Multivariate adaptive shrinkage (mash) analysis, which increased our power to detect significant correlated effects, found significant effects for all phenotypes. Mash found two large genomic regions with effects on multiple phenotypes, supporting a hypothesis of pleiotropic or linked effects that were likely selected on in pursuit of a crop ideotype. Overall, our results demonstrate that statistical genomics approaches can be used on MET phenotypic data to discover significant genetic effects and to define genomic regions associated with crop improvement.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/215/1/267/56242141/genetics0267.pdf",""

We find evidence that accrual management prior to exercise is positively associated with the decision to quickly sell shares after exercise, increasing the profitability of a short-term exercise-and-sell strategy. Alternatively, we find that post-exercise accrual management is associated with executives choosing to delay selling shares, consistent with minimizing personal income taxes. Specifically, our results suggest that executives are more likely to sell immediately after satisfying the minimum (12 month) holding period for long-term capital gain treatment when they have more income-increasing accruals during the holding period. These results expand on prior research that focused on earnings management leading up to option exercise.","https://publications.aaahq.org/jfr/article-pdf/5/1/115/74052/i2380-2146-5-1-115.pdf",""

Our findings suggest that in countries with weaker investor protection, poor fund performance exposes investors to a greater risk of fraud and legal jeopardy, thus triggering a larger outflow of capital.","http://academic.oup.com/rfs/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/rfs/hhaa051/33363975/hhaa051.pdf",""

However, crystal accumulation and/or melt loss may play an important role in bulk-rock compositional variability (McCarthy and Hasty 1976; McCarthy and Groves 1979; Wiebe 1993; Wiebe et al. 2002; Collins et al. 2006; Deering and Bachmann 2010; Miller et al. 2011; Vernon and Collins 2011; Lee and Morton 2015; Lee et al. 2015; Barnes et al. 2016a; Schaen et al. 2018). Recognizing and quantifying the effects of crystal accumulation and melt loss in these silicic systems is challenging. Hornblende-melt Fe/Mg partitioning relationships and hornblende (Hbl) chemometry are used here to test for equilibrium with encompassing bulk-rock and/or glass compositions from several plutonic and volcanic systems. Furthermore, we assess the extent to which these tests can be appropriately applied to Hbl from plutonic systems by investigating whether Hbl from the long-lived (~10 Ma) Tuolumne Intrusive Complex preserves magmatic crystallization histories. On the basis of regular zoning patterns, co-variation of both fast- and slow-diffusing trace elements, Hbl thermometry, and compositional overlap with volcanic Hbl we conclude that Hbl from plutons largely preserve records supporting the preservation of a magmatic crystallization history, although many compositional analyses yield calculated temperatures &lt;750 °C, which is unusual in volcanic Hbl.","https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/msa/ammin/article-pdf/105/1/77/4910192/am-2020-6972.pdf",""

Background: Display perturbation techniques and Fourier analysis of steering movements can be used to infer drivers’ spatio-temporal distribution of attention to preview. Fourier analysis of tracking error time histories provides measures of position, velocity, and acceleration error. Method: Participants tracked a winding roadway with 1 s of preview in low-fidelity driving simulations. Position and rate-aided vehicle dynamics were paired with top-down and windshield displays of the roadway. Results: For both vehicle dynamics, tracking was smoother with the windshield display. This display emphasizes nearer preview positions and has a closer correspondence to the control-theoretic optimal attentional distributions for these tasks than the top-down display. This correspondence is interpreted as a form of stimulus–response compatibility. The position error and attentional signal-to-noise ratios did not differ between the two displays with position control, but with more complex rate-aided control much higher position error and much lower attentional signal-to-noise ratios occurred with the top-down display. Conclusion: Display-driven influences on the distribution of attention may facilitate tracking with preview when they are similar to optimal attentional distributions derived from control theory. Application: Display perturbation techniques can be used to assess spatially distributed attention to evaluate displays and secondary tasks in the context of driving. This methodology can supplement eye movement measurements to determine what information is guiding drivers’ actions.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0018720820902879",""

Though seldom designed to elucidate genetic mechanisms, MET data sets are often much larger than could be duplicated for genetic research and, given proper interpretation, may offer valuable insights into the genetics of adaptation across time and space. The Cooperative Dry Bean Nursery (CDBN) is a MET for common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) grown for &gt; 70 years in the United States and Canada, consisting of 20–50 entries each year at 10–20 locations. The CDBN provides a rich source of phenotypic data across entries, years, and locations that is amenable to genetic analysis. To study stable genetic effects segregating in this MET, we conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using best linear unbiased predictions derived across years and locations for 21 CDBN phenotypes and genotypic data (1.2 million SNPs) for 327 CDBN genotypes. The value of this approach was confirmed by the discovery of three candidate genes and genomic regions previously identified in balanced GWAS. Multivariate adaptive shrinkage (mash) analysis, which increased our power to detect significant correlated effects, found significant effects for all phenotypes. Mash found two large genomic regions with effects on multiple phenotypes, supporting a hypothesis of pleiotropic or linked effects that were likely selected on in pursuit of a crop ideotype. Overall, our results demonstrate that statistical genomics approaches can be used on MET phenotypic data to discover significant genetic effects and to define genomic regions associated with crop improvement.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/215/1/267/56242141/genetics0267.pdf",""

Data were collected on spring and fall-calving purebred and commercial Angus females with calves (n = 1192) from March until July from 2008 to 2018 in Mississippi, Arkansas and Texas. Dams were observed once monthly by two trained technicians for winter hair coat shedding and give a visual hair shedding score of 1 to 5 with 1 indicating 100% shed, 2 = 75% shed, 3 = 50% shed, 4 = 25% shed, and 5 indicating 0% shedding of the winter hair coat. Month of first shedding (MFS) was determined once a female reached an average hair shedding score of ≤ 3.5 for any given month. Calf birth and weaning weights were considered as performance of the dam. For cow performance, the response variables included AdjBW and d205wt of the calf. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS with significance declared at P ≤ 0.05. The model included MFS as a fixed effect with calf sex as a covariate and calf sire as a random effect. Females that obtained a shedding score of ≤ 3.5 by May had heavier calves at birth (P ≤ 0.01) when compared with those that shed in June and July, with July weights being the lightest. Females that scored ≤ 3.5 by May has significantly heavier d205wt (P ≤ 0.01) when compared to those that shed by June and July. When comparing locations, females in Arkansas shed later (P ≤ 0.01) when compared with both Mississippi and Texas, which were similar.

Optimized cryo‐EM screens pushed the limits of cryo‐EM sub‐100 kDal imaging to observe domain detail in the 59.7 kDal AtCESA1catD. The first cryo‐EM optimization strategy utilized the Volta Phase Plate at low defocus to capture high contrast images with more detail. This strategy yielded problematic maps and was not ideal to yield a high resolution structure. The second cryo‐EM optimization strategy used higher electron dose over a defocus range. This strategy revealed the P‐CR and CSR domains and is very promising for high resolution structures. We purified AtCESA1catD monomer and showed that negative stain structure fits to Gh506.

The purposes of this study were to: (1) assess the readiness of PTs (those who do not currently prescribe TY to patients) to integrate TY into treatment, and (2) determine the feasibility of a 5-week online TY training to improve the readiness of PTs to utilize TY in their practices. Licensed PTs (n = 103) were recruited nationally through social media and email. Eligible and consented PTs registered for a 5-week online TY training course. PTs’ perceptions of TY and the role of safety and confidence in prescribing TY to patients were measured at baseline and postintervention. Feasibility outcomes were measured after completion of the course. Benchmarks included: (1) &gt; 70% of PTs would find the course acceptable; (2) &gt; 60% would finish the course; and (3) there would be significant improvements in PTs’ perceptions of TY. A total of 95 eligible PTs consented and registered for the course, with 60 (63.1%) completing the intervention.

Sampling sites in a defined geographic region provide an opportunity to characterize chemical contaminants, with spatial interpolation as a tool to provide estimates for non-sampled sites. At the same time, the use of in vitro bioactivity measurements has been shown to be informative for rapid risk-based decisions. In this study, we measured in vitro bioactivity in 39 surface soil samples collected immediately after flooding associated with Hurricane Harvey in Texas in a residential area known to be inundated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contaminants. Bioactivity data were from a number of functional and toxicity assays in 5 human cell types, such as induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocytes, cardiomyocytes, neurons, and endothelial cells, as well as human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Data on concentrations of PAH in these samples were also available and the combination of data sources offered a unique opportunity to assess the joint spatial variation of PAH components and bioactivity. We found significant evidence of spatial correlation of a subset of PAH contaminants and of cell-based phenotypes. In addition, we show that the cell-based bioactivity data can be used to predict environmental concentrations for several PAH contaminants, as well as overall PAH summaries and cancer risk. This study’s impact lies in its demonstration that cell-based profiling can be used for rapid hazard screening of environmental samples by anchoring the bioassays to concentrations of PAH. This work sets the stage for identification of the areas of concern and direct quantitative risk characterization based on bioactivity data, thereby providing an important supplement to traditional individual chemical analyses by shedding light on constituents that may be missed from targeted chemical monitoring.","http://academic.oup.com/toxsci/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/toxsci/kfaa166/34715315/kfaa166.pdf",""

With a focus on assessment centers, interviews, situational judgment tests, and work samples as alternative methods, the results indicated that consonant with the construct/method distinction, the effectiveness of a method in reducing subgroup differences is a function of the constructs assessed. Specifically, there are larger White‐African American subgroup differences that favor Whites for cognitive constructs on paper‐and‐pencil tests compared to the alternative methods; and most notably, the opposite result was obtained for noncognitive constructs such that, compared to paper‐and‐pencil assessments, substantially larger White‐African American subgroup differences were observed for alternative methods. A similar pattern of results was obtained for White‐Hispanic comparisons, albeit based on a smaller number of data points. In summary, the study's results indicate that the ubiquitously asserted effectiveness of the method‐change approach for reducing subgroup differences is overstated, with said effectiveness depending on the construct assessed.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hrm.22027",""

Method: Utilizing a unique cross-sectional dataset compiled by the Institute for Democracy & Higher Education for the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections that merges student voting data, enrollment records from the National Student Clearinghouse, and institutional data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, we employed multi-level binary logistic regression to account for individual and organizational influences. Results: The relationship between voting and student characteristics aligns with national voting trends, in that students who are female, older, and White had higher odds of voting. However, there was one notable exception in 2012 where Black students had higher odds of voting than their White peers. We also found that students enrolled full-time and those enrolled at colleges in electoral battleground states were more likely to vote in 2012 and 2016. Weak or mixed relationships emerged between voting and environmental factors such as campaign spending, ballot initiatives, get-out-the-vote programs, restrictive voter laws, and compositional diversity of the student body. Conclusion: This study provides insight for community college leaders on potential ways to engage students in an effort to promote voter turnout in a presidential election year on their campuses.

This study uses the One Health wholistic framework for examining bovine tuberculosis (TB) and its relationship to human health. This approach can help bridge surveillance data gaps and contribute to disease control and prevention programs for dairy farm workers, cattle, and the environment. The primary objective of this study was to compare the self-reported history of TB among dairy workers in Bailey County, Texas, with occupational categories of risk and exposure to TB. Methods:: A cross-sectional study was conducted among dairy workers. Job positions were used as a proxy for exposure to cattle—high and medium/low. We employed bivariate analyses to examine differences between groups using both the chi-square test and the nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test. Results:: Of the 293 dairy workers invited, 77.0% ( n = 225) participated. No statistically significant associations were found between job categories and reported history of TB exposure. Workers in the high group were younger, Guatemalan males with lower levels of formal education, more likely to be single with no children, and cohabitating with coworkers compared with the medium/low group. Conclusion/Application to Practice:: Self-reported TB history among dairy workers is an imprecise measure of being previously diagnosed with TB. Dairy workers at risk for occupationally acquired TB could be tested for TB before employment and tested periodically thereafter, and more expeditiously treated if a positive test is obtained. Future studies should focus on the feasibility of offering on-farm health services, such as TB screening.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2165079920976521",""

The findings suggest that government funding is positively associated with social enterprise’s employment of the disadvantaged, community contribution, and democratic decision-making.

Current practice suggests conducting numerical modeling to find out the desired factor of safety (FS) using RPP in the design of landslide repair. While the slope stability is heavily dependent on soil strength parameters and slope geometry, RPP length and spacing can also play a significant role in reaching the target factor of safety for the highway slope. During this study, a safety prediction model was developed using both statistical and machine learning (ML) approaches to use RPP in slope stabilization. Initially, parametric study was conducted using five different soil strengths, six slope heights, three slope ratios, three RPP lengths, and five RPP spacing configurations. Using the strength reduction techniques of Finite Element Modeling Software PLAXIS 2D, FS was determined for more than 1,000 combinations. Afterwards, a statistical approach was undertaken to determine a safety prediction model containing all possible parameters. Finally, an ML approach was conducted for safety model. The ML approach was found to be more accurate than the classical statistical approach with 85% accuracy of predicting the FS for an RPP reinforced highway slope. The developed model was validated against the values obtained from the numerical modeling, which indicated that the SF obtained from the developed model was in good agreement with those from finite element method (FEM) analysis.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0361198120924415",""

It empirically builds on the ethnographic study of a small North American company in the construction industry. This study makes three main contributions. First, it argues that even as the position of working‐class White men in the current class order limits their life chances, they nevertheless access small but significant benefits based on race. Second, it contributes to current conversations on White privilege by showing how such privilege manifests itself differently depending on social class position.

PAH prognosis remains poor with a 15% mortality rate within 1 year, even with modern clinical management. Previous clinical studies proposed wall shear stress (WSS) to be an important hemodynamic factor affecting cell mechanotransduction, growth and remodeling, and disease progress in PAH. However, WSS in vivo is typically at most 2.5 Pa and a doubt has been cast whether WSS alone can drive disease progress. Furthermore, our current understanding of PAH pathology largely comes from small animals' studies in which caliber enlargement, a hallmark of PAH in humans, is rarely reported. Therefore, a large‐animal experiment on pulmonary arteries (PAs) is needed to validate whether increased pressure can induce enlargement of PAs caliber. In this study, we use an inflation testing device to characterize the mechanical behavior, both nonlinear elastic behavior and irreversible damage of porcine arteries. The parameters of elastic behavior are estimated from the inflation test at a low‐pressure range before and after over‐pressurization. Then, histological images are qualitatively examined for medial and adventitial layers. This study sheds light on the relevance of pressure‐induced damage mechanism in human PAH.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fjbm.a.37042",""

Method: A cross-sectional sample of 29 bilingual students (16 boys and 13 girls) enrolled in grades prekindergarten through Grade 4 produced a total of 58 narrative retell language samples in English and Spanish. Key outcome measures in each language included the percentage of normal (%ND) and stuttering-like (%SLD) disfluencies, percentage of words in mazes (%MzWds), number of total words, number of different words, and mean length of utterance in words. Results: Cross-linguistic, pairwise comparisons revealed significant differences with medium effect sizes for %ND and %MzWds (both lower for English) as well as for number of different words (lower for Spanish). On average, the total percentage of mazed words was higher than 10% in both languages, a pattern driven primarily by %ND; %SLDs were below 1% in both languages. Multiple linear regression models for %ND and %SLD in each language indicated that %MzWds was the primary predictor across languages beyond other language measures and demographic variables. Conclusions: The findings extend the evidence base with regard to the frequency and type of disfluencies that can be expected in bilingual children who do not stutter in grades prekindergarten to Grade 4. The data indicate that %MzWds and %ND can similarly index the normal disfluencies of bilingual children during narrative production. The potential clinical implications of the findings from this study are discussed.","http://pubs.asha.org/doi/pdf/10.1044/2019_PERSP-19-00164",""

Traffic conditions are highly dynamic and evolve over time. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the arterial’s performance periodically to determine how well a traffic signal system is functioning. Arterial performance is conventionally evaluated based on travel time/speed collected via the probe vehicles. New approaches based on high-resolution traffic signal events have been proposed by a group at Purdue University, based on the Purdue Coordination Diagrams (PCDs). Both traditional arterial travel times/speeds and the PCDs can effectively reflect the level of traffic progression on arterials, while some practical questions have been raised about how to synthesize these two methods. The framework proposed in this paper integrates two types of performance measures by defining new multi-intersection coordination diagrams to examine traffic signal performance. The multi-intersection coordination diagram under different speeds can provide a straightforward tool for informed offset adjustments of actuated traffic signal coordination. In contrast, the state-of-the-practice traffic coordination performance analysis relies on fixed timings and empirical fine-tuning in the field. It is expected that these efforts can provide new insights to practitioners on how to use emerging traffic data better to improve the performance of actuated traffic signal operations on arterials.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0361198120918869",""

We aim to examine the role of consumer evaluations of a company's CSR, from both content and delivery perspectives, in shaping consumer skepticism about overall corporate responsibility and advancing retail patronage intentions. We conducted an online nationwide survey with 402 U.S. consumers and used structural equation modeling for the data analysis. The results indicate that the fit between a company's core values and the CSR activities it communicates plays a significant role in alleviating skepticism, while the fit between a consumer's personal values and CSR activity does not have significant effects on skepticism. Both inauthentic information and self‐promotional tone significantly increase skepticism, and skepticism is found to be a significant mediator in the paths from CSR content and delivery factors to retail patronage intentions. Our supplementary analyses suggest that delivery of CSR information can be more important than the content itself in affecting skepticism. The results should inspire practitioners, when planning for CSR communication, to carefully consider fit, tone, and authenticity in order to minimize skepticism and avoid negatively impacting consumers' retail patronage intentions.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fcsr.1969",""

This untested supposition raises questions about whether servant leadership’s emphasis on employee support relative to goal achievement has negative consequences for a unit’s financial performance through group organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) that constrain servant leadership’s positive effect on unit performance. The resource allocation framework applied to OCBs suggests that trade-offs exist between OCBs and financial performance because both behaviors impose demands on employees’ limited time. In addition, a work group’s social norms may exert subtle forms of pressure on group members to increase their helping behaviors. This pressure may incur process loss that negatively affects financial performance. Data consisting of 546 employees from 103 bank branches within a large Midwestern community bank support servant leadership’s positive direct effect on branch financial performance; its stronger relationship with support climate than goal achievement climate; and its negative indirect effect on branch financial performance through support climate and branch OCBs that weakened servant leadership’s total positive effect on branch financial performance.

Methods: We present a retrospective review of open tibial shaft fractures at two high-volume level 1 trauma centres with differing practices with regard to the acute management of soft tissues. Site 1 attempts acute primary closure, while site 2 prefers delayed closure/coverage. Comparisons include percentage of primary closure, number of surgical procedures until definitive closure, percentage requiring soft tissue coverage, and percentage of 90-day wound complication. Results: Overall, there were 219 patients at site 1 and 282 patients at site 2. Differences in rates of acute wound closure were seen (168 (78%) at site 1 vs 101 (36%) at site 2). A mean of 1.5 procedures for definitive closure was seen at site 1 compared to 3.4 at site 2. No differences were seen in complication, nonunion, or amputation rates. Similar results were seen in a sub-analysis of type III injuries. Conclusion: Comparing outcomes of open tibial shaft fractures at two institutions with different rates initial wound management, no differences were seen in 90-day wound complications, nonunion rates, or need for amputation. Attempted acute closure resulted in a lower number of planned secondary procedures when compared with planned delayed closure. Providers should consider either acute closure or delayed coverage based on the injury characteristics, surgeon preference and institutional resources without concern that the decision at the time of index surgery will lead to an increased risk of complication.

Design:: Cross-sectional study. Setting and participants:: Using the 2017 Health Information National Trends Survey, we extracted data of 504 respondents who had been diagnosed with any of the 22 types of cancer listed in the survey questionnaire. Measures:: As independent variables, we assessed 3 different types of support: emotional, informational, and tangible support. As mediating and outcome variables, we measured LTPA and mental health, respectively. Analysis:: Using AMOS version 22, a path analysis was conducted to measure model fit. A mediation test was then conducted using bootstrapping procedures. Results:: The hypothesized model provided an acceptable fit to the data. Specifically, emotional support ( b = .15, p = .005), informational support ( b = .13, p = .008), tangible support ( b = .12, p = .010), and LTPA ( b = .14, p = .001) were significantly associated with mental health. We revealed a significant mediating effect of LPTA on the relationship between emotional support and mental health (Estimate = .037, 95% CI = .001–.098, p < .05). Conclusion:: Social support and LTPA played a significant role in promoting mental health among people with cancer. In particular, the results confirmed that individuals with cancer who reported receiving emotional support tended to engage in LTPA and thus reported better mental health.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0890117120961321",""

The risk of dementia is calculated by a series of performance-based tests. Measures include levels of dementia: no dementia, cognitive impairment not dementia (CIND), and dementia, and three domains of cognition functioning: orientation, executive function, and memory. Social integration is an additive index measured by several questions, including marital status, living arrangement, social network, social contact, and social participation. Our results indicate that people with higher social integration have a lower risk of both cognitive impairment (not dementia) and dementia compared to those with lower social integration. This pattern continued across specific domains of cognitive functioning, including lower risk of orientation impairment, executive function impairment, and memory impairment for those with higher social integration. Tests of both gender and racial interactions did not yield any significant differences. Our findings demonstrate the strong association between social integration and lower risk of dementia among older adults.

Fifty steers were received (day 0; 361 ± 6.4 kg), housed individually and fed once daily at 0800 hours. All steers were transitioned to a dry-rolled corn-based finishing diet from days 0 to 21 and then were fed the control finishing diet until day 50. Treatment diets were formulated to achieve ≤5 (CON), 15 (15PPM), 30 (30PPM), 60 (60PPM), or 90 ppm (90PPM) of total dietary fumonisin. Steers were fed the fumonisin treatment diets from day 50 until harvest on day 160; individual animal body weights (BW) were measured on days 0, 50, 100, 150, 159, and 160. Liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle tissue samples were collected at harvest for histopathological analyses, and liver samples were further analyzed for sphinganine (SA) and sphingosine (SO) concentration. Animal performance, carcass data, and liver enzyme concentration were analyzed using a mixed model; categorical data were analyzed via nonparametric models. Contrasts were used to test for linear and quadratic responses. Throughout the study, there was no effect of treatment (P &gt; 0.60), or a linear response (P &gt; 0.16) from increasing fumonisin levels, on BW or dry matter intake (DMI). However, CON tended to have a lower average daily gain (ADG) than the fumonisin treatments during the fumonisin treatment period (P = 0.10), and there was a positive linear response (P = 0.02) of ADG to fumonisin during the treatment period. There were no treatment differences in hot carcass weight, dressing percentage, marbling score, ribeye area, or yield grade. There were no effects of treatment on either liver abscesses (P = 0.95) or telangiectasis (P = 0.13). We observed a treatment difference for SA and SA:SO (P &lt; 0.01), as well as a quadratic response (P &lt; 0.02); both SA and SA:SO increased as dietary fumonisin increased. There were no observed differences between treatments for histopathology scores of kidney (P = 0.16), liver (P = 0.25), or skeletal muscle (P = 0.59) tissue. No adverse effects were observed in steers fed increasing dietary levels of fumonisin for 110 d prior to harvest.

In all three studies, forcing items to load on their intended and separate constructs measuring entitlement fit the data well thus providing some evidence of discriminant validity. The correlation between the two entitlement constructs was larger than in previous studies but short of that which is necessary for collinearity providing further evidence of discriminant validity in each study. In each study the amount of shared variance between the two latent entitlement constructs was more than the variance explained in either construct thus failing to provide evidence of discriminant validity.

Background: Crash reports have identified in-vehicle distraction to be a major cause of law enforcement vehicle crashes. The MCT has been found to be the most frequently used in-vehicle technology and the main source of police in-vehicle distraction. Method: Twenty police officers participated in a driving simulator-based assessment of driving behavior, task completion time, and perceived workload with two MCT configurations under operational and tactical levels of driving. Results: The findings revealed that using the MCT configuration with speech-based data entry and head-up display location while driving improved driving performance, decreased task completion time, and reduced police officers’ workload as compared to the current MCT configuration used by police departments. Officers had better driving but worse secondary task performance under the operational driving as compared to the tactical driving condition. Conclusion: This study provided an empirical support for use of an enhanced MCT configuration in police vehicles to improve police officers’ safety and performance. In addition, the findings emphasize the need for more training to improve officers’ tactical driving skills and multitasking behavior. Application: The findings provide guidelines for vehicle manufacturers, MCT developers, and police agencies to improve the design and implementation of MCTs in police vehicles considering input modality and display eccentricity, which are expected to increase officer and civilian safety.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0018720820908362",""

Only in recent years is this trend beginning to change. Vermont was the first state to adopt legislation in 2013, followed by California, and Washington DC in 2015. In 2018, Hawaii was added to the list and most recently, New Jersey, and Maine in 2019. Other trends have become evident as well. Whereas between 1995 and 2013 there was a median of nine bills introduced by six states in a given biennium, this has increased to 31 bills in 24 states between 2015 and 2019, And while until 2013, only two or three states at most would have more than a single bill in play, the median has now doubled to five states and Washington DC since 2015. This paper examines whether or not these recent trends are in fact, political strategies that could explain and potentially predict success in future sessions. We examine the efficacy of constancy (the perseverance of introducing bills over multiple sessions) and frequency (introducing multiple bills in the same session) using both the six successful attempts as well as 264 failed attempts since 1994. Comparing the common attributes of successful legalization as well as failures, perseverance cannot be ruled out as a beneficial variable, but can only be vindicated with more data in the future. There was no evidence across all the data to suggest that multiple bills contributed to success. The data also shows that ideological liberalism is currently a necessary but not sufficient condition to pass assisted suicide bills, although it is expected to become more significant as the issue settles down party lines. Increases in the number of bills, the number states with bills, and perhaps the number of bills introduced in a given state appears more as a response to environmental stimuli that makes bills appear more viable: namely previous state victories and shifts in public opinion.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/pa.2463",""

This paper investigates whether systemic risk influences auditors' GCO decisions during the crisis due to potential adverse spillover effects. Using 496 bank-year observations, we find that auditors are less likely to issue a GCO to systemically risky banks, and this auditor behavior reduces Type I errors without increasing Type II errors. The effects are more pronounced during the crisis period, especially for banks that are large and connected, have lower litigation risk, or are audited by Big 4 auditors or industry specialists. Overall, our findings suggest that during the crisis period, auditors were less likely to over-issue GCOs to systemically risky banks, resulting in more accurate GCOs.","https://publications.aaahq.org/ajpt/article-pdf/39/3/1/50799/i1558-7991-39-3-1.pdf",""

These results are contrary to the expected correlation between shear strain and water content for quartz deformed by dislocation creep and water-weakening processes. The observed inverse correlation indicates that fluid inclusions and hydrous defects within grains were lost by mobile grain boundary sweeping and grain boundary diffusion. Although reduced water contents might lead to hardening as chemical weakening is diminished, quartz mylonites in the immediate footwall (5 mm) to the thrust are characterized by intense strain localization and contain the least water, and there is little evidence of shear zone widening. Water weakening appears to have been important throughout the quartz mylonites, controlled by the presence of water, not by water concentration. Fluids present within relict inclusions and at grain boundaries may have governed the high water fugacities critical for water weakening.","https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-pdf/48/6/557/5051275/557.pdf",""

NAVs result from different etiologies which include collagenopathies, immunological, hematological, and infection mechanisms, and other rarer unidentifiable or idiopathic causes. NAV etiologies account for about 10–15% and 20–25% of adult and pediatric stroke cases, respectively, and therefore, diagnosing the underlying cause of NAV becomes clinically very important. Clinical diagnosis of NAV is challenging because the clinical presentation is very non-specific and overlapping with various other central nervous system disorders. Before the advent of non-invasive techniques, making a diagnosis of non-atherosclerotic vasculopathy as a cause of the stroke was very challenging. Today with newer techniques such as high-resolution magnetic resonance (MR), MR and computed tomography perfusion, and angiogram, there are number of pointers which can give us a lead about the non-atherosclerotic causes. Imaging may provide the first lead to the clinician regarding the diagnosis or possible differential diagnosis so that the targeted and focused biomarkers (blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or/and in some cases biopsies) may be obtained to clinch the diagnoses. The purpose of the article is to enumerate the causes, clinical features, and illustrate the imaging findings of the various non-atherosclerotic vasculopathic disorders and discuss “pearls” to their diagnosis. In this article, we have also discussed the latest advances in vascular imaging and elaborated on few uncommon non-atherosclerotic vasculopathies. These are very relevant clinically in the day-to-day practice for the radiologist, neurologist, and the neurointerventionalist.","https://clinicalimagingscience.org/imaging-of-non-atherosclerotic-vasculopathies/",""

In contrast, the use of readily available and low-cost molecular methods improves both the quality and quantity of available data. We applied such methods to a bat fatality dataset (n = 439 bats) from far-south Texas, USA. Using DNA barcoding, we increased accurate species identification from 83% to 97%, and discovered the presence of 2 bat species outside of their known geographic ranges. Using a PCR-based approach to determine sex, the number of carcasses with correct sex assignment increased from 35% to 94%, and we documented a female-biased sex ratio for all species combined and for Dasypterus ega.

There is, however, little evidence of the factors that drive the settlement norm and its exceptions in audit legal disputes. To better understand these factors, we rely on theory related to how professionals manage risks and, as a result, how professions defend jurisdictional claims. We use this theoretical lens to help motivate four research questions that we probe by interviewing 27 prominent attorneys experienced in audit litigation. Consistent with our lens, our interview data indicate that attorneys manage their risks, including the risk of reputational loss, by settling based on their expectations of trial verdicts. Unlike trials, settlements simultaneously enable attorneys on both sides to limit costs and avoid catastrophic jury verdicts and, by doing so, claim “wins” for their clients. Attorneys also stress that they settle many audit disputes without any legal filings. Thus, a large subset of disputes is invisible to the public and researchers. Attorneys characterize trials as exceptions to the settlement norm that emerge due to abnormal conditions sometimes present in disputes. However, trial verdicts in these abnormal conditions help attorneys justify the use of settlements to clients, as attorneys stress that by settling they can avoid the dreaded possibility of extreme unfavorable verdicts.

The results revealed that the two dialectal groups significantly differed in nasalance scores and nasality ratings, with Texas South exhibiting higher nasalance for standardized passage readings and assigning higher nasality ratings on the synthetic auditory stimuli than Midland. These findings indicate that, in addition to production variations of oral-nasal balance characteristics, perceptual variations of nasality exist at a dialectal level.","https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article-pdf/147/1/568/16703081/568_1_online.pdf",""

We report the field-based characterization of multiple morpho-physiological and reproductive stress resilience traits in 11 interspecific chromosome substitution (CS) lines isogenic to each other and the inbred G. hirsutum line TM-1. Significant genetic variability was detected (p < 0.001) in multiple traits in CS lines carrying chromosomes and chromosome segments from CS-B (G. barbadense) and CS-T (G. tomentosum). Line CS-T15sh had a positive effect on photosynthesis (13%), stomatal conductance (33%), and transpiration (24%), and a canopy 6.8 °C cooler than TM-1. The average pollen germination was approximately 8% greater among the CS-B than CS-T lines. Based on the stress response index, three CS lines are identified as heat- and drought-tolerant (CS-T07, CS-B15sh, and CS-B18). The three lines demonstrated enhanced photosynthesis (14%), stomatal conductance (29%), transpiration (13%), and pollen germination (23.6%) compared to TM-1 under field conditions, i.e., traits that would expectedly enhance performance in stressful environments.

What has been established in the literature is that individuals with mental illness are more likely to experience victimization than the general public, and certain risk factors influence the likelihood of victimization. What remains unexplored is the possibility that a person with mental illness’ perception that mental illness is stigmatized may be significantly associated with victimization experiences. Thus, the purpose of the current study is to examine whether stigma and victimization are associated, and in what direction. In other words, does perceived stigma lead to victimization? Or does victimization lead to perceived stigma? To assess these research questions, data from the Community Outcomes of Assisted Outpatient Treatment study are used, which is a longitudinal study of individuals with serious mental illness ( n = 184). A variety of methods are employed to assess the association between victimization and perceived stigma including logistic and ordinary least squares regression models. Results from the logistic regression model indicate that perceived stigma is associated with an increase in the odds that a person with mental illness will experience victimization at later follow-ups. Results from the ordinary least squares regression analysis, however, show that victimization at baseline does not predict perceived stigma at later times.

Robotic surgical systems are expensive to own and operate, and the purchase of such technology is an important decision for hospital administrators. Most prior literature focuses on the comparison of clinical outcomes between robotic surgery and other laparoscopic or open surgery. There is a knowledge gap about what drives hospitals’ decisions to purchase robotic systems. Objective. To identify factors associated with a hospital’s acquisition of advanced surgical systems. Method. We used 2002 to 2011 data from the State of California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development to examine robotic surgical system purchase decisions of 476 hospitals. We used a probit estimation allowing heteroscedasticity in the error term including a set of two equations: one binary response equation and one heteroscedasticity equation. Results. During the study timeframe, there were 78 robotic surgical systems purchased by hospitals in the sample. Controlling for hospital characteristics such as number of available beds, teaching status, nonprofit status, and patient mix, the probit estimation showed that market-level directly relevant surgery volume in the previous year (excluding the hospital’s own volume) had the largest impact. More specifically, hospitals in high volume (>50,000 surgeries v. 0) markets were 12 percentage points more likely to purchase robotic systems. We also found that hospitals in less competitive markets (i.e., Herfindahl index above 2500) were 2 percentage points more likely to purchase robotic systems. Limitations. This study has limitations common to observational database studies. Certain characteristics such as cultural factors cannot be accurately quantified. Conclusions. Our findings imply that potential market demand is a strong driver for hospital purchase of robotic surgical systems. Market competition does not significantly increase the adoption of new expensive surgical technologies.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2381468320904364",""

Little attention has focused on glaciers in the northern periphery of the Chinese Tian Shan. This study aims to map a recent glacier inventory and examine the glacier area shrinkage and surface elevation change for the central massif of the Borohoro Mountains in the past 41 years. Using declassified Hexagon images (1977), Landsat 5 TM (1994 and 2007), Sentinel 2A (2018) and altimetry data from the Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) over 2003–2009 with the 30-m Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model, multi-temporal glacier fluctuations and the influence of topographic and climatic factors were investigated. Results show that the glacier area decreased from 287.5 ± 8.2 km2 in 1977 to 215.8 ± 4.1 km2 in 2018, at a rate of 0.61 ± 0.01% year−1. Glacier disintegration has led to a gradual increase in the number of glaciers and reached 224 glaciers in 2018. The shrinkage was at the highest rate during the 1994–2007 period and the smallest during 1977–1994. Glacier size, hypsometry, and median, maximum, and range of elevation are the most significantly correlated parameters with the relative area change. The surface elevation changes from two of the largest glaciers revealed a stronger thinning on the southern slope compared to the northern slope. These observations of glacier loss are primarily driven by the marked warming trend since the 1970s and confirmed with the overall pattern of glacier retreat in the Tian Shan from previous studies.","https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/12/5/1502/pdf",""

Effective screening could reduce mortality by 10%–30%. Used individually, neither serum CA125 nor transvaginal sonography (TVS) is sufficiently sensitive or specific. Two-stage strategies have proven more effective, where a significant rise above a woman's baseline CA125 prompts TVS and an abnormal sonogram prompts surgery. Two major screening trials have documented that this strategy has adequate specificity, but sensitivity for early-stage (I–II) disease must improve to have a greater impact on mortality. To improve the first stage, different panels of protein biomarkers have detected cases missed by CA125. Autoantibodies against TP53 have detected 20% of early-stage ovarian cancers 8 months before elevation of CA125 and 22 months before clinical diagnosis. Panels of autoantibodies and antigen–autoantibody complexes are being evaluated with the goal of detecting &gt;90% of early-stage ovarian cancers, alone or in combination with CA125, while maintaining 98% specificity in control subjects. Other biomarkers, including micro-RNAs, ctDNA, methylated DNA, and combinations of ctDNA alterations, are being tested to provide an optimal first-stage test. New technologies are also being developed with greater sensitivity than TVS to image small volumes of tumor.","https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article-pdf/29/12/2504/1946027/2504.pdf",""

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) surveillance 3 years after implantation and then every 2 years, but adherence to these recommendations is poor. The authors identified current practice management for breast implant rupture surveillance by surveying practicing U.S. plastic surgeons. Methods:: An online survey of all active members of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons was performed. Questions analyzed imaging practice patterns related to breast implants. Logistic regression models were used to analyze determinants for radiographic imaging in breast implant patients. Results:: The survey had a response rate of 16.5 percent. For patients with breast implants, 37.7 percent of respondents recommended MRI at the recommended intervals. Fifty-five percent perform imaging only if there is a problem with the implant. Academic surgeons more frequently recommended MRI (56.3 percent and 39.3 percent; Conclusions:: MRI limitations include high costs, time commitments, and equipment constraints. Fewer than 40 percent of survey respondents suggest the recommended screening frequency to their patients; however, academic, low-volume, early-career surgeons are more likely to recommend MRI implant monitoring. Screening recommendations need to be evidence based and align with common practices to prevent undue system, provider, and patient burden.","https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/PRS.0000000000006812",""

This study used a free classification task to assess native American English listeners' ability to group together talkers from six major dialect regions of American English. Listeners residing in Ohio and Texas were provided with a sentence-long (experiment 1) or paragraph-long (experiment 2) speech sample produced by talkers from each of the six regions presented in one of three conditions: unmodified, monotonized (i.e., flattened F0), and low-pass filtered (i.e., spectral information above 400 Hz removed). In both experiments, listeners in the unmodified and monotonized conditions made more accurate groupings, reflecting their reliance on segmental properties for classifying regional variation. Accuracy was highest for Northern and Western talkers (experiment 1) and Mid-Atlantic talkers (experiment 2). Listeners with experience with multiple dialects as a result of geographic mobility did not show increased accuracy, suggesting a complex relationship between linguistic experience and the perception of available acoustic cues to socioindexical variation.","https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article-pdf/147/1/657/16702860/657_1_online.pdf",""

Our lab has previously demonstrated that chronic exposure of ergot alkaloids adversely effects innate immune response. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine changes in cytokine profiles in heat tolerant heifers exposed to ergot alkaloids from endophyte-infected fescue compared to wildtype controls. Angus X Senepol heifers were blocked by weight and hair coat genotype, Slick (S) or Normal (N) then randomly fed novel endophyte fescue (EN) or endophyte-infected fescue (EI) haylage in a total mixed ration for 63d (n=5 per group). Weekly measurements were collected to monitor physiological responses during exposure to ergot alkaloids. Blood samples were collected for cytokine analysis on d 0, 14, 28 and 56. Cytokine concentrations were quantified using Quantibody® Bovine Cytokine Arrays. Data were analyzed using PROC MIXED of SAS with repeated measures. Statistical significance was determined at P&lt; 0.05 and a tendency at 0.05&lt; P&lt; 0.10. Concentrations of TNF were greater in EN-S heifers (6.57 ng/ml) compared to other heifer groups (P&lt; 0.05; 1.33, 2.34, 3.15 ng/ml for EN-N, EI-S, and EI-N, respectively). Concentrations of IL21 were greater in EN-S heifers (8.15 ng/ml) compared to other heifer groups (P&lt; 0.05; 1.55, 3.43, 3.26 ng/ml for EN-N, EI-S, and EI-N, respectively). Concentrations of IFNA (P=0.0543), IFNG (P=0.0558), IL1F1 (P=0.0587), and IL1F5 (P=0.0738) tended to be greater in in EN-S heifers compared to other heifer groups. Interestingly, concentrations of chemokine CCL4 (953.5 vs. 183.7 pg/mL) and CXCL9 (2.57 vs. 0.69 ng/mL) were significantly greater in S heifers than N heifers (P&lt; 0.05). No differences were observed for IL13 and CXCL10 (P &gt;0.05). In contrast to previous data, exposure to ergovaline via endophyte-infected fescue, did not induce an innate immune response. Rather, cytokine concentrations were elevated in heifers with the slick hair genotype. Overall, developing a better understanding of the interaction between ergot alkaloids and the slick hair genotype will help to improve cattle health management.","http://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/98/Supplement_2/40/34565391/skz397.091.pdf",""

We examine whether enhanced mandatory derivatives disclosures set forth in FAS 161 improve users' understanding of firms' hedging activities and offer three main findings. First, we find that this mispricing does not persist after FAS 161. Second, we find that the correction of mispricing is greatest when disclosure might help investors most. Finally, we find that analyst forecast accuracy improves after FAS 161. Overall, our results suggest that the enhanced mandatory derivative disclosures required by FAS 161 improved users' understanding of the effects of derivative and hedging activities on future firm performance and firm value—and consequently mitigated investor mispricing.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article-pdf/96/2/153/39651/i1558-7967-96-2-153.pdf",""

This article presents a broad understanding of pluralism as antifascist practice, whilst studying antifascist publications in Spain during the 1970s, considering intersectional analysis and methodology. Many of the producers of these publications saw themselves as explicitly antifascist or at the very least part of a countercultural movement which challenged social norms promoted under the late fascist regime. By looking at these antifascist movements, using intersectional approaches, we can better understand how fascism itself functions and how it can be disentangled – as scholarship on fascism has largely ignored how intersectional analytical approaches might give us new insights into fascism.","https://brill.com/view/journals/fasc/9/1-2/article-p98_98.xml",""

It is not surprising, therefore, that a growing list of companies is generating substantial revenue by selling proprietary data collected as part of their doing business. Because data are an experience good, their true valuation remains uncertain to both sellers and buyers. As a result, firms often resort to bargaining to arrive at a mutually acceptable arrangement. We consider the situation where the seller can offer a data demonstration to the buyer to reduce the valuation uncertainty. A data demonstration can increase the buyer’s willingness to pay; however, it also puts the seller at an information disadvantage in the bargaining process. Interestingly, we find that there are circumstances under which the presence of the seller’s outside option can trigger a demonstration with complete information, even if the buyer does not underestimate data value. We also find that sellers need to offer different demonstration strategies—sometimes to just correct underestimation bias and sometimes to correct bias and reduce uncertainty. If the development of the demonstration comes at a cost, we find that it is optimal for the seller to provide demonstrations that are only partially informative when the seller’s outside option is moderately high.

This approach emphasizes that the relationship dynamics of men, women, and gender‐nonconforming individuals are highly diverse, reflecting that gender is a social construct formed within interactions and institutions. We explicate how GAR can reorganize the study of sexual and gender diversity in three research areas related to aging and relationships—caregiving, marital health benefits, and intimacy—and discuss theory‐driven methods appropriate for a GAR research agenda. A GAR framework reorients research by complicating taken‐for‐granted assumptions about how gender operates in mid‐ to later‐life romantic relationships and queering understandings of aging and romantic relationships to include experiences outside of heteronormative and cisnormative categories.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fjftr.12368",""

The purpose of this study was to examine potential protective factors against PTB such as religiosity and acculturation. Methods: This study was a prospective investigation of Mexican- and U.S.-born pregnant women. Women were recruited from a low-income-serving prenatal clinic in Texas. Survey instruments included socioeconomic variables, acculturation, and religiosity/spirituality (R/S). Logistic regression was used to examine the associations between acculturation, religiosity, and PTB. Because of the low prevalence of PTB in our sample, we were not able to adjust for confounding characteristics. Results: Ninety-one low-income women, mostly Mexican immigrants, participated in the study. PTB in our sample was lower than the national average in the United States (5.5% vs. 9.9%) and was positively but moderately associated with high R/S. R/S scores were high, particularly for frequency of attendance, prayer, and religious coping. Women with lower acculturation had higher scores on the religiosity measures. Conclusion: Further research is needed with a larger sample to include other ethnic and racial minorities to more fully understand the relationships between acculturation, religiosity, and PTB.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1540415320976643",""

While their position of political influence in the Republican coalition is widely recognised, the full range of effects of this position on evangelicals' climate opinions is not. To move research on evangelicals from the margins of climate change opinion research, we review and integrate the interdisciplinary literature on US evangelicals, climate change, and politics. In assessing this literature, we identify three areas in need of further research. First, there is a critical need for more research on the climate attitudes of evangelicals of color, who comprise a growing share of the evangelical tradition in the US. Second, highlighting the Christian Right's active engagement in the climate debate, we identify a need for more experimental work examining how cues from religious elites may shape evangelicals' opinions. Finally, we suggest that to better harness insights across disciplines, researchers must become more explicitly aware of how different disciplines conceptualize temporality. Attending to temporal scale suggests that a new approach is needed to test how dominion beliefs, which are widely thought to be an important theological driver of climate skepticism, operate. We also suggest that two factors that appear to play a weak or limited role in driving climate skepticism over the short term (anti‐science attitudes and evangelical religiosity) may in fact play a significant role in driving skepticism over the medium term.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/wcc.693",""

Although physiological changes and effects on native predators for Australian populations have been well documented, Florida populations have received little attention. Cane toads were collected from populations spanning the invaded range in Florida to assess relative toxicity, through measuring morphological changes to parotoid glands, likelihood of secretion, and the marinobufagenin (MBG) content of secretion. We found that residual body indices increased in individuals from higher latitude populations, and relative parotoid gland size increased with increasing toad size. There was no effect of latitude on the allometric relationship between gland size and toad size. We observed an increase in likelihood of secretion by cane toads in the field with increasing latitude. Individuals from southern and northern populations did not vary significantly in the quantity of MBG contained in their secretion. Laboratory‐acclimated cane toads receiving injections of epinephrine were more likely to secrete poison with increasing dose, although there was no difference in likelihood of secretion between southern and northern populations. This suggests that differences between populations in the quantities of epinephrine released in the field, due to altered hypothalamic sensitivity upon disturbance, may be responsible for the latitudinal effects on poison secretion. Our results suggest that altered pressures from northward establishment in Florida have affected sympathetic sensitivity and defensive mechanisms of cane toads, potentially affecting risk to native predators.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ece3.7118",""

These changing neighborhood dynamics are starting to shift the context of urban schooling in some districts across the nation. While we know that racial and socioeconomic demographic shifts are associated with neighborhood and school gentrification, there is little conceptual clarity about how school gentrification unfolds over time and the varying conditions of schools in gentrified neighborhoods. To advance scholarship on the topic, researchers need an organizing framework. This study addresses this gap by drawing on existing research, 16 years of Census and American Community Survey data, and 6 years of district data in Austin, Texas. Highlighting Austin, an urban city with growing neighborhood gentrification, we put forth a typology to explain the experiences of schools in the district.

Study design: Ex vivo cadaveric study. Sample population: Canine thoracic limbs (n = 15 limb pairs). Methods: Limbs were acquired from healthy Labrador retrievers that had been euthanized for reasons unrelated to this study. A limb press was used to obtain standing and recumbent caudocranial radiographs before and after PAUL. Foot lateralization and rotation were directly measured in standing position. Mechanical joint angles were determined using full limb radiographic montages and the center of rotation of angulation (CORA) method for pre‐PAUL (Pre), 2‐mm PAUL (PAUL2), and 3‐mm PAUL (PAUL3). Data are reported as mean ± SD and 95% CI. Mixed linear modeling was used to identify differences in limb alignment values and foot position, with significance established at Results: There were differences in five of 12 limb alignment values pre‐PAUL and post‐PAUL in standing and recumbent positions. In the standing position, there was an increase in mechanical medial proximal radioulnar angle (Pre, 80.6° ± 2.5°; PAUL2, 82.6° ± 2.4°; PAUL3, 84° ± 2.4°) and a decrease in elbow compression angle (Pre, 1.4° ± 1.3°; PAUL2, 1° ± 0.9°; PAUL3, 0.8° ± 1°). There was a movement of mechanical humeral radioulnar angle (Pre, −8.9° ± 2.8°; PAUL2, −6.1° ± 2.7°; PAUL3, −5.2 ± 2.7°), mechanical thoracic humeral angle (Pre, 3.9° ± 1.7°; PAUL2, 2.4° ± 1.4°; PAUL3, 2.6° ± 1.5°), and elbow mechanical axis deviation (Pre, 1.9% ± 1.1%; PAUL2, 0.9% ± 1.1%; PAUL3, 0.4% ± 1.4%) toward a value of “0” representing coaxial alignment of the limb. The foot underwent lateralization (Pre, 1.4 ± 0.6 cm; PAUL2, 1.8 ± 0.7 cm; PAUL3, 2.3 ± 0.7 cm) and external rotation (Pre, 10.5° ± 4.7°; PAUL2, 13.7° ± 5.1°; PAUL3, 16° ± 6.6°). Conclusion: In the ex vivo setting, PAUL resulted in translation of the mechanical axis of the thoracic limb from a medial to lateral direction through alterations in limb alignment values associated with the elbow, humerus, and proximal radius/ulna.

Despite all the advantages such as faster operation, less bleeding, and shorter postsurgery recovery time, side effects including sticking, charring, and rebleeding still occur, leading to increased surgery time and sometimes fatal complications. Tissue impedance during the electrosurgical process has been used to determine the electrical power of the process. However, little has been done to understand the dynamic tissue impedance and its effectiveness in monitoring the vessel sealing process. Moreover, the samples used in previous studies all had small diameters of 2–5 mm. In this study, an experimental setup was developed to perform vessel sealing tests using large-diameter blood vessel samples with mimicking blood flow. The tissue impedance during the heating process was obtained. Burst pressures after sealing were measured. A finite element simulation model was developed to understand the dynamic impedance behavior. It is seen that the tissue impedance increases rapidly in the beginning of the heating process and remains at a level that is several orders of magnitude higher than the initial value. This rapid impedance increase indicates protein denaturing, thus can be used to monitor the electrosurgical vessel sealing process. An impedance-based monitoring algorithm was developed, with which a burst pressure at least twice the normal human systolic blood pressure was achieved.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/medicaldevices/article-pdf/doi/10.1115/1.4046653/6524746/med_014_02_021006.pdf",""

Infant sleep patterns are associated with incident OW in childhood, but few have examined its relationship with RWG. Objective: Examine associations between newborn sleep‐wake patterns and incident RWG at 6 months of life and OW at 36 months. Methods: Low‐income Mexican/Mexican‐American women with OW/obesity and their infants (n = 126) enrolled in a 1‐year randomized controlled trial designed to prevent incident, infant RWG and toddlerhood OW/obesity. Sleep pattern metrics at 1 month were extracted from the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire‐Revised. Outcome measures included RWG (>0.67 positive change in weight‐for‐age Z‐score) from birth to 6 months and incident OW (body mass index percentile ≥85) at 36 months. Results: By 6 months, 35.7% (n = 45) of infants experienced RWG, and by 36 months 42.3% (n = 41) of toddlers were OW. Napping ≥5x/day at 1‐month was significantly associated with decreased odds for RWG compared to napping <5x (OR = 0.11, 95%CI:0.02, 0.63). Each 1‐hour increase in nocturnal vs diurnal sleep was associated with greater odds of incident OW at 36 mos (OR = 1.51, 95%CI:1.13, 2.03). Conclusions: Early‐life sleep patterns related to infant nap frequency and nocturnal vs diurnal sleep distribution were associated with obesity outcomes and may be important intervention targets to prevent lasting consequences on infant growth.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ijpo.12726",""

Overall assessment indicated strong reliability between raters with ICC(2, k) of .80: 95% confidence interval (CI) = [0.77, 0.83], F(269, 19906) = 5.1, p < .001, and mean kappa score of .91. Furthermore, high social validity ratings suggest the BSP-OT is a valuable contribution to the field concerning praise research and teacher development. The process of developing the BSP-OT and study findings are presented, with a discussion of implications and suggestions for future research.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1098300720907988",""

Specifically, what are the ecological contexts in which youth witness intimate partner violence (IPV), how do these experiences differ by immigration generational status, and what is the impact on youth’s externalizing and internalizing behaviors? MA adolescents ( N = 279; 15–17 years, M = 16.17, SD = 0.81) from the Southwest United States participated in an online survey. Over half of adolescents had witnessed at least one incidence of IPV in the prior 2 weeks, usually involving their peers. Adolescents who had spent more time in the United States were more likely to witness violence and rated it as more severe than more recently immigrated youth. A cross-sectional path model revealed that witnessing IPV was associated with internalizing and externalizing problems. However, the associations between witnessing IPV and dating violence perpetration and victimization were mediated through acceptance of dating violence norms. Each successive generation may be more likely to witness violence across a range of ecological contexts. Witnessing violence may be central to a host of negative outcomes, including deviancy, poor mental health, and dating violence. However, preventive interventions can help youth to challenge violence norms within intimate partnerships as well as to cope with violence in their homes, peer groups, and communities.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0886260520946818",""

Each theory makes a different prediction about the role of each affordance in status allocation. We test these competing predictions to explain status allocations across 14 nations.

In this paper, we evaluate the direct and indirect costs associated with TPW in the 30 largest U.S. cities. We first developed a conceptual framework for the analysis of direct and indirect costs of TPW abatement. Next, we applied a simulation model to estimate the total costs of TPW in major U.S. cities. This model includes data on city population, smoking prevalence rates, and per capita litter mitigation costs. Total annual TPW-attributable mean costs for large US cities range from US$4.7 million to US$90 million per year. Costs are generally proportional to population size, but there are exceptions in cities that have lower smoking prevalence rates. The annual mean per capita TPW cost for the 30 cities was US$6.46, and the total TPW cost for all 30 cities combined was US$264.5 million per year. These estimates for the TPW-attributable cost are an important data point in understanding the negative economic externalities created by cigarette smoking and resultant TPW cleanup costs. This model provides a useful tool for states, cities, and other jurisdictions with which to evaluate a new economic cost outcome of smoking and to develop new laws and regulations to reduce this burden.","https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/13/4705/pdf",""

We propose and evaluate an alternative explanation that managers anticipate GCOs and time their trades to avoid insider sales in the GCO year (hereafter, the timing hypothesis). Consistent with the timing hypothesis, we find that insider sales increase two to four years prior to the issuance of a GCO and then decline in the year of GCO. Additional analysis suggests that insiders' anticipatory trading is enabled, at least in part, by early communication between auditors and their most important clients regarding the likelihood of a GCO.

The purpose of this case series is to describe the clinical findings, diagnostic imaging findings, treatment and outcome of 10 horses with complex pastern injuries involving the scutum medium. Horses with scutum medium injury presented with septic synovial structures, acute lameness or chronic lameness. In all cases, scutum medium injury occurred with severe tendon, ligament or osseous injuries in the pastern region. The most common comorbidities were proximal interphalangeal joint sepsis, injuries to the straight sesamoidean ligament and/or the superficial digital flexor tendon branches. This case series also highlights that severe injuries to the scutum medium can be associated with proximal interphalangeal joint subluxation. Outcome and treatment are dependent upon concurrent injuries but proximal interphalangeal joint arthrodesis should be considered.

Field monitoring and local management are important tools to prevent and control infestations but require additional coordination to be operative region-wide. Computational modeling techniques have been effective in simulating local population dynamics and in capturing spread of invasive species on a regional scale. We use an integrated ecological model to simulate local and regional infestation dynamics of sugarcane aphids, Melanaphis sacchari (Zehntner) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), on sorghum, Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench (family Poaceae), in the southern to central Great Plains of the United States. Local dynamics of aphid populations on sorghum are simulated by a spatially explicit, individual-based model, whereas regional aphid migration is simulated by an atmospheric model that computes inert air particle (aphid) transport, dispersion, and deposition. Simulation results indicate timing of initial infestations in the south affects spatiotemporal patterns of infestation throughout the region. Probability of local infestations is a function of both percentage of land occupied by growing sorghum and prevailing winds. Thus, due to availability of sorghum, relatively later dates of initial infestation in the south will probably lead to infestations farther north that become established more quickly following the first appearance of aphids in the south. The model we present, in coordination with field monitoring schemes, could be applied as a forecasting tool in region-wide pest management systems.","http://academic.oup.com/aesa/article-pdf/113/2/79/32925645/saz047.pdf",""

Exp. 1: ruminally cannulated Angus-crossbred steers (n = 7; BW = 520 ± 30 kg) were individually fed ad libitum for 21 d in a completely randomized design (CRD). Markers (Cr2O3 and TiO2) were placed inside the rumen twice daily (7.5 g of each marker). Fecal samples were collected twice daily from day 14 to 21. Exp. 2: crossbred wethers (n = 8; BW = 68 ± 3 kg) were individually fed ad libitum for 21 d in a CRD. During this period, 2 g of Cr2O3 and TiO2 were top-dressed onto the feed twice daily. Sheep were housed in metabolism crates for 5 d for total fecal collection. Concentration of markers was determined on diets, refusals, and fecal specimens (fresh, dry-only, and dried/ground) using atomic absorption to detect Cr and spectrophotometry for Ti. Concentration of both markers was also determined via the PXRF spectrometer. Delta between ATTD estimated by wet chemistry and PXRF was not different from zero (P ≥ 0.14) when using cattle fresh fecal specimens for both markers, whereas ATTD estimated by PXRF with dry-only and dried/ground fecal specimens were 3.6 and 1.1 percent units lower (P ≤ 0.04), respectively, than ATTD estimated by wet chemistry for Cr and Ti, respectively. Regardless of the fecal sample preparation method on cattle specimens, Ti concentration was similar (P = 0.39) among methodologies, while Cr was underestimated (P &lt; 0.01) by 13% when PXRF was used in dry-only or dried/ground samples. The ATTD of sheep was underestimated (P &lt; 0.01) by 2.4 percent units compared with control when Cr was measured by PXRF in dry-only samples. The Cr concentration in dry-only fecal specimens of sheep tended (P = 0.09) to be lower compared with wet chemistry analysis. Fresh and dry/ground sheep fecal samples assessed for Cr, and dry-only assessed for Ti were not (P ≥ 0.49) affected by detection method. The Cr fecal recovery tended (P = 0.10) to be the lowest for dry-only, the greatest for wet chemistry, intermediate for fresh and dry/ground sheep-fecal specimens; while not affected (P = 0.40) for Ti.

However, the cellular mechanisms underlying the improved survival rates in cancer patients treated with these drugs are incompletely understood. Inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), alteration of p-c-JUN and p-ERK signaling pathways and inhibition of mitochondrial complex 1 have all been implicated as part of metformin's anti-tumorigenesis activities. More recently, metformin was shown to influence the activity of epigenetic modifying enzymes resulting in genome-wide alterations in DNA methylation patterns in breast cancer cell lines. In this study, we investigated whether GT3 and metformin treatment would alter methylation pathways in prostate cancer cells.The prostate cancer cell line PC-3 (androgen independent) and normal prostate control cell line RWPE-1 were treated with varying concentrations of either GT3, metformin, the methylation inhibitor azacitidine, or metformin plus azacitidine for 6 hours. Genomic DNA was isolated, and methylation assessed using the Illumina Infinium methylation EPIC BeadChip array. Analysis revealed treatment of PC-3 cells with metformin promoted hypermethylation of CC2D2B, GHDC, LINC01377, PLPP2, and PTK2 and decreased methylation of TSPY4 as compared to normal prostate controls. qRT-PCR experiments confirmed decreased expression of PTK2 mRNA, consistent with hypermethylation of PTK2. In contrast, GT3 did not affect methylation of any identifiable recognizable genes. This study suggests metformin, but not GT3, may inhibit prostate cancer proliferation partially through epigenetic changes which disrupt downstream focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling pathways. Metformin is a promising chemopreventive agent; studies investigating the impact of metformin on cellular adhesion and FAK pathways are ongoing in our laboratory.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/80/16_Supplement/1274/641013/Abstract-1274-Metformin-not-tocotrienol-increases",""

Through these interviews, we were able to create a model that represented the physical activity experiences discussed. Based on the model that emerged from this study, we recommend physical activity opportunities are made available that are noncompetitive, sensory-friendly, and that allow for participants to socialize as they prefer.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1362361320932444",""
