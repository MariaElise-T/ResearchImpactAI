Potential residues critical for interaction between ENaC alpha, beta, and gamma subunits were identified and peptide segments containing the targeted residues were PCR amplified, ligated onto a pGEX‐4t‐2 vector, and transformed into Top10 E. coli. This vector contains a GST‐tag that was used to purify the peptides and immobilize them for further analysis by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Binding between sets of peptides predicted to be important for stabilizing interactions in ENaC was investigated using SPR. One peptide from a potential interacting set of peptide regions was immobilized through the GST‐tag and binding with the corresponding partner (with GST‐tag removed) was quantified. Two interactions ‐one between the alpha‐palm and beta‐thumb, and the other between the beta‐palm and gamma‐thumb regions of ENaC ‐ were analyzed. The alpha‐palm and beta‐thumb interaction had a measured KD of 2.9 x 10‐8 M, whereas the interaction from the beta‐palm, gamma‐thumb region was in the micromolar range for KD.

The prevalence of high-severity forest fires is increasing in the southern and western United States, creating the necessity to better understand effects of high-severity fire, and subsequent postfire management actions, on forest ecosystems. In this study we used a recent high-severity wildfire in the Lost Pines ecoregion of Texas to assess effects of the wildfire and postfire clearcutting on six microclimate parameters: air temperature, absolute humidity, mean wind speed, maximum wind speed, soil temperature, and soil moisture. We also assessed differences between burned areas and burned and subsequently clearcut areas for short-term survivorship of loblolly pine Pinus taeda seedling trees. We found that during the summer months approximately 2 y after the wildfire, mean and maximum wind speed differed between unburned and burned areas, as well as burned and burned and subsequently clearcut areas. Our results indicated air temperature, absolute humidity, soil temperature, and soil moisture did not differ between unburned and burned areas, or burned and burned and subsequently clearcut areas, during the study period. We found that short-term survivorship of loblolly pine seedling trees was influenced primarily by soil type, but was also lower in clearcut habitat compared with habitat containing dead standing trees. Ultimately, however, the outcome of the reforestation initiative will likely depend primarily on whether or not the trees can survive drought conditions in the future, and this study indicates there is flexibility in postfire management options prior to reseeding. Further, concerns about negative wildfire effects on microclimate parameters important to the endangered Houston toad Bufo (Anaxyrus) houstonensis were not supported in this study.","http://meridian.allenpress.com/jfwm/article-pdf/5/1/174/1699943/072013-jfwm-051.pdf",""

Using ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc test, we analyzed 24‐hour recall data collected from 82 WIC caregivers of infants 4‐12 months using Nutrition Data System for Research. Among infants 4‐6 months, PF and BF infants consumed significantly less formula and more breastmilk than their FF counterparts (P<0.05); BF infants also consumed significantly more breastmilk than PF infants (P<0.05). Among infants 6‐12 months, fully BF consumed significantly less formula than FF infants (P<0.001); the difference in formula intake between PF and BF infants approached significance (P=0.054). Intake of breastmilk was significantly different among all groups; BF infants consumed more breastmilk than PF (P<0.001) and FF infants (P<0.001); PF infants consumed more than FF infants (P=0.001). These results suggest that infants receiving less formula from WIC packages actually consumed less formula and more breastmilk, in accordance with the intent of the policy change.","",""

The genus Bufo is no exception, as many bufonids exhibit an antipredator response (e.g., reduction in activity) to the presence (recent and current) of predators. Using a mesocosm experiment in a field laboratory setting, we tested solo and groups of Bufo (Incilius) nebulifer tadpoles for an antipredator response to chemical cues produced by 1) the presence of anisopteran nymphs (kairomone cue) and 2) the predation of conspecifics by anisopteran nymphs (a combination of diet and alarm cues, which we termed predation cue). We quantified the magnitude of the response by calculating response strength. We analyzed data with a blocked ANOVA followed by a Tukey's honestly significant difference analysis. We found that chemical cue type (kairomone vs. predation) affected response strength, but aggregation status (solo vs. group) did not. Furthermore, solo tadpoles and groups of tadpoles reduced their activity in response to predation cues, whereas only solo tadpoles reduced their activity in response to kairomone cues, a heretofore unobserved phenomenon. Our results suggest that B. nebulifer tadpoles modulate their response to specific types of chemical cues depending on their aggregation status. As reduced activity comes at a cost to resource acquisition and growth, aggregation status may indirectly affect the life history of B. nebulifer. The elucidation of these potential life history effects may aid managers in estimating anuran population viability.","http://meridian.allenpress.com/jfwm/article-pdf/6/1/199/2387529/042014-jfwm-028.pdf",""

The underlying causes of these attitudes are not fully understood. While outgroup bias is well studied, ingroup bias has received far less attention. We examined ingroup biases among Hispanic women and outgroup biases toward Hispanics among White (Caucasian non-Hispanic) females using the startle eyeblink paradigm, the Implicit Association Test (IAT), and an explicit self-report measure. Hispanic and White male faces were used as exemplars during both the startle task and the IAT. A similar pattern of results were observed for indirect measures: both groups displayed startle and IAT responses indicative of negative attitudes toward Hispanic male faces relative to White male faces, although less so for Hispanic participants. Combined groups correlational analyses revealed a significant positive relationship between startle eyeblink amplitude and subtle subscale bias scores. However, no relationships were found between any measures when groups were examined separately. The comparable pattern of startle and IAT results suggests that in spite of the likelihood that these measures index different aspects of attitudes and tap into different processes, inter and intragroup biases are manifested similarly. The finding of negative ingroup biases among Hispanic females is consistent with system justification theory, which posits that members of devalued groups internalize negative stereotypes about their ingroup. This study extends startle eyeblink research of intergroup racial biases, while also expanding this line of research to intragroup biases. In doing so, these results add to our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the persistent nature of stereotypes.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1368430214542256",""

In males, dry digesta mass declined throughout the day and crude protein concentrations were greatest when wet digesta and organ mass were the largest. Additionally, declines in dry digesta and wet digesta mass coincided with declines in crude protein concentrations and organ mass. Females did not display declines in rumen–reticulum fill (wet mass).

The purpose of this study was to assess levels of burnout among practicing interior designers, and identify both individual and situational factors relative to burnout. The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI–GS) was used to measure burnout and a Job Satisfaction survey gathered basic demographic and situational (job–related) information from practicing interior designers ( N = 130).

Therefore, we examined the scaling relationship between body mass and liver mass and the influences of age, sex, body condition (back fat), and lactation on liver mass to gain insight into liver-mass variation in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus (Zimmermann, 1780)). Deer from two sites in Texas (89 males, 70 females) were sampled; one site was sampled before the mating season (premating) and the other site was sampled during the mating season. There was an allometric relationship between body mass and liver mass (scalars 0.59–0.80) at both sites. Also, sex and age were predictors of liver mass at one site, whereas lactation was influential at the other location. Controlling for body mass, males had heavier livers than females during the mating but not the premating season and age was positively related to liver mass. Our findings indicate that sex and lactation status were coupled to liver masses, but the effect of these two factors differed between premating and mating seasons.

Precipitation amounts were compared against established 50- and 100-yr recurrence interval thresholds for 1-, 6-, and 24-h durations. The authors identified points where analyzed precipitation exceeded the threshold, and combined points associated with the same weather system into events. At shorter durations, points exceeding the thresholds were most common in the Southeast, whereas points were more uniformly distributed for the 24-h duration. Most 24-h events have more points than the other durations, reflecting the importance of organized precipitation systems on longer temporal scales. Though monthly peaks varied by region, the maximum (minimum) usually occurred during the summer (winter); however, the 24-h point maximum occurred in September owing to tropical cyclones. The maximum (minimum) in hourly extreme rainfall points occurred at 2300 (1100) LST, though there were regional differences in the timing of the diurnal maxima and minima. Over half of 100-yr, 24-h events were a result of mesoscale convective systems (MCS), with synoptic and tropical systems responsible for nearly one-third and one-tenth, respectively. Of the 10 events with the most points exceeding this threshold, 5 were associated with tropical cyclones, 3 were synoptic events, and 2 were MCSs. Among the MCS events, 7 of the top 10 were training line/adjoining stratiform (TL/AS). While the 49 TL/AS events investigated further had similar moisture availability, the more widespread events had stronger low-level winds, stronger warm air advection, and stronger and more expansive frontogenesis in the inflow.","https://journals.ametsoc.org/downloadpdf/journals/mwre/142/9/mwr-d-13-00345.1.xml",""

Methods: We examined data from mothers of 351 infants with isolated anotia/microtia and 8435 unaffected infants from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study with an expected delivery date from 1997 to 2007. Sociodemographic, maternal, and acculturation factors (e.g., age, maternal education, household income, body mass index, gestational diabetes, folic acid, smoking, alcohol intake, study center, parental birthplace, and years lived in the United States, maternal language) were assessed as overall risk factors and also as risk factors among subgroups of Hispanics (United States‐ and foreign‐born) versus non‐Hispanic whites. Results: Compared with non‐Hispanic whites, both United States‐ and foreign‐born Hispanic mothers demonstrated substantially higher odds of delivering infants with anotia/microtia across nearly all strata of sociodemographic and other maternal factors (adjusted odds ratios range: 2.1–11.9).

The percentages of drivers yielding to a staged pedestrian were collected at 7 TCS sites, 22 RRFB sites, and 32 PHB sites. Overall, TCSs in Texas had the highest driver yielding rates, with an average of 98%. The average driver yielding rate for RRFBs in Texas was 86%, whereas the average for PHBs was 89%. The RRFB results for Texas were slightly higher than those found in other studies, perhaps because all RRFB sites included in this analysis had “School Crossing” signs and were located near a school. The number of devices within a city may have an impact on driver yielding. Those cities with a greater number of a particular device (i.e., Austin, Texas, for the PHBs and Garland, Texas, for the RRFBs) had higher driver yielding rates than cities where the device was used at only a few crossings. A comparison of the number of days since installation revealed statistically significantly higher driver yielding rates for those devices that had been installed longer. For PHBs, the results support the use of PHBs on roadways with multiple lanes or a wide crossing. For RRFBs, a lower rate of compliance was observed for longer crossing distances and indicated that for a certain crossing distance width, a device other than the RRFB should be considered.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/2463-06",""

This study investigates sexual dimorphism and temporal trends in femoral torsional asymmetry among the Arikara from the seventeenth to the early nineteenth century. To establish if there are population differences, femoral torsion was first measured using a direct method on a diverse comparative sample of Native Americans from the Southwest, Midwest, and Great Plains as well as American Whites and Blacks. To examine temporal trends among the Arikara, femoral torsion was examined using the orientation of the maximum bending rigidity at subtrochanteric in 154 females and 164 males from three temporal variants of the Arikara Coalescent tradition. There is significant sexual dimorphism in femoral torsional directional and absolute asymmetry among most Native American samples, but not among American Whites and Blacks. Among the Arikara there is significant sexual dimorphism in femoral torsional asymmetry in all three temporal variants, and asymmetry in femoral torsional asymmetry increased significantly from the protohistoric to the early historic period among females. The increased femoral torsional asymmetry is likely associated with a common side‐sitting posture observed in historic photographs of Great Plains females. Historic Arikara females may have habitually sat in this compulsory position for extended periods while conducting domestic chores. The dramatic change from the protohistoric to historic period suggests a cultural change in sitting posture among females that was widespread across the Northern Plains.

Literature indicated numerous factors affect food security and researchers should continue examining elements that may influence food insecurity. The lack of acquiring finance can prohibit farmers from planting and harvesting crops, and thus, is a cause of food insecurity. Mexican banks receive economic agricultural forecasts from the Ministry of Agriculture. This study sought to describe Mexican banks’ degree of acceptance and use of the Ministry’s information on Twitter. Fourteen (N = 14) agricultural loan administrators from Mexican banks were examined to address this study’s research objectives. Agricultural loan administrators were interviewed to determine their acceptance and use of the Ministry’s statistics on Twitter. Participants reported the dissemination of agricultural statistics on Twitter saved banks time by providing a source that delivered specific crop forecasts and not all crop outlooks simultaneously. Twitter can be used to let a bank know the particular value of a commodity in real time thus being able to inform not only their financial decisions but notify farmers pursuing loans. The Ministry of Agriculture’s Twitter feeds increased performance and communication while requiring little effort due to the pervasive nature of the technology. The use of information disseminated on Twitter allowed farmers to receive funds faster thus enabling them to plant and harvest crops in order to aid in the battle against food insecurity.","",""

The current study suggests a considerably updated panel, and applies it to public health birth defects registry data to determine the potential number of de novo cases. Data were taken from deliveries in 1999–2009 from the Texas Birth Defects Registry, an active surveillance program. Cases with one of the conditions or syndromes in the panel were identified using codes and text searches. Frequencies and birth prevalence were calculated for the overall panel and subcategories within it. Of the 60 conditions appearing in previous papers on sentinel phenotypes, 21 (35%) were used in the current study along with 27 new phenotypes. We found 1,694 cases. Of those, 1,100 exhibited phenotypes thought to arise de novo in at least 90% of the cases (“all/almost all” subpanel), and 594 considered de novo in roughly 50–90% of cases (“most” subpanel). Chromosomal deletion disorders were present in 523 cases and imprinting disorders in 243. After adjusting for maternal age, occurrence of cases in the total panel, “most” subpanel, and imprinting disorders subpanel were significantly associated with paternal age. Our panel of sentinel phenotypes differs from previous panels due to evolved knowledge of genetic disorders, different approaches with respect to interviewing, and different operational definitions. It is hoped that using an overall panel as well as subpanels may maximize statistical power as well as suggest potential mechanisms. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fajmg.a.36623",""

This study uses operational global ensemble forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) to diagnose atmospheric processes and assess forecast uncertainty in this event. Several ensemble analysis methods are used to examine the processes that led to the development and maintenance of this precipitation system. Differences between ensemble members that correctly predicted heavy precipitation and those that did not were determined, in order to pinpoint the processes that were favorable or detrimental to the system's development. Statistical analysis was used to determine how synoptic-scale flows were correlated to 5-day area-averaged precipitation. The precipitation throughout Nashville and the surrounding areas occurred ahead of an upper-level trough located over the central United States. The distribution of precipitation was found to be closely related to the strength of this trough and an associated surface cyclone. In particular, when the upper-level trough was elongated, the surface cyclone remained weaker with a narrower low-level jet from the south. This caused the plume of moisture from the Caribbean Sea to be concentrated over Tennessee and Kentucky, where, in conjunction with focused ascent, heavy rain fell. Relatively small differences in the wind and pressure fields led to important differences in the precipitation forecasts and highlighted some of the uncertainties associated with predicting this extreme rainfall event.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/mwr/article-pdf/142/1/222/4293433/mwr-d-13-00020_1.pdf",""

Grazing lands that support ruminant livestock provide numerous ecosystem services, including provision of food, water, and genetic resources; climate and water regulation; support of soil formation; nutrient cycling; and cultural services. In the U.S. southern Great Plains, beef production on pastures, rangelands, and hay is a major economic activity. The region's climate is characterized by extremes of heat and cold and extremes of drought and flooding. Grazing lands occupy a large portion of the region's land, significantly affecting carbon, nitrogen, and water budgets. To understand vulnerabilities and enhance resilience of beef production, a multi‐institutional Coordinated Agricultural Project (CAP), the “grazing CAP,” was established. Integrative research and extension spanning biophysical, socioeconomic, and agricultural disciplines address management effects on productivity and environmental footprints of production systems. Knowledge and tools being developed will allow farmers and ranchers to evaluate risks and increase resilience to dynamic conditions.

He critiques Brownson’s conceptual ideal of “equivalency” as a potentially profound force of transformation of gender relations in the military. While conceptually progressive, he errs in framing the potential transformation within the concept of “patriarchy.” Further, King is unable to recast binary gendered language to acknowledge fully the concept of “kinship.” For females to maximally succeed in the military, and particularly in combat roles, patriarchy as the defining explanation for male–female interaction must be discarded and the enabling concepts of equivalency and kinship must be embraced. The continued strength of military organizations and the individuals within them emerges from the reciprocity of these two concepts.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0095327X14547807",""

However, to benefit from the information access provided by online social media, the participant will have to overcome the allure of homophily—which refers to the propensity to seek interactions with others of similar status (e.g., religion, education, income, occupation) or values (e.g., attitudes, beliefs, and aspirations). This research assesses the extent to which social media participants exhibit homophily (versus heterophily) in a unique context—virtual investment communities (VICs). We study the propensity of investors in seeking interactions with others with similar sentiments in VICs and identify theoretically important and meaningful conditions under which homophily is attenuated. To address this question, we used a discrete choice model to analyze 682,781 messages on Yahoo!

Our results revealed that, despite the benefits from heterophily, investors are not immune to the allure of homophily in interactions in VICs. The tendency to exhibit homophily is attenuated by an investor’s experience in VICs, the amount of information in the thread, but amplified by stock volatility.

Methods: Using parallel process latent growth curve modeling, the authors examined if increase in alliance was associated with reduced drinking behaviors and a statistical mediator in the relationship between treatment modality and outcome. The authors used data from Project MATCH ( J Stud Alcohol. 1997;58:7–29; Addiction. 1997;92:1671–1698), which investigated client-treatment matching effects for alcohol treatment among outpatient ( n = 952) and aftercare ( n = 774) participants randomized to cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT), 12-step facilitation (TSF), or motivational enhancement therapy (MET). Results: Results indicate therapist-rated alliance increased significantly for CBT and TSF participants, but not MET. Participants across modalities in both samples evidenced the largest decrease in drinking behaviors from baseline to midtreatment and a slight deterioration in treatment gains from midtreatment to 15 months posttreatment. Alliance did not mediate the relationship between treatment modality and outcome, but increase in alliance was significantly related to decrease in drinking frequency. Conclusions: These findings provide further justification for researchers to specifically design studies to examine change in alliance as a mechanism of change in alcohol treatments.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/08897077.2013.792761",""

Data for 16,813 cases with isolated male genital malformations and 1,945,841 male live births delivered from 1999 to 2008 were obtained from the Texas Birth Defects Registry. For each phenotype category, 13 maternal and infant variables were assessed, and adjusted prevalence ratios were estimated based on the same multivariable Poisson regression model. A significant negative association was observed between previous live births versus no previous live births and four phenotypes (e.g., adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] for any male genital malformation: 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.75–0.81). The prevalence of 4 of the phenotypes was significantly higher among multiple versus singleton pregnancies (e.g., aPR for any male genital malformation: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.25–1.47). We also observed significant associations between multiple phenotypes and residential region at delivery, delivery year, month of conception, and maternal age, race/ethnicity, education, and birthplace, including significant associations for trends (maternal age, maternal education, and birth year modeled ordinally).

Further independent studies have revealed the opening of some of these microfractures on the wall surface of main hydraulic fractures. In addition, early-production well-testing analysis in some of these cases provides estimates for the hydraulically-induced-fracture surface area, which is much larger than fracture dimensions estimated in fracturing design or provided by the location of microseismic events. Opening of small-sized fractures could be a possible reason for this discrepancy. In this paper, we show to what extent thermal stresses induced by temperature difference between fracturing fluid and formation fluid could provide the driving force to open a portion of these small, cemented natural fractures lying on the surface of hydraulic fractures. Moreover, through combination of stress analysis and empirical fracture-distribution models obtained from outcrops, we calculate the increase of total reservoir/fracture contact surface under the condition of microfracture activation. Our thermoelasticity analysis reveals the effect of the pump rate and temperature of the fracturing fluid on the number of activated microfractures. The results show that the volume of the microfractures varies depending on the length of the microfracture, rock properties, and time. At the end of the paper, through an example, we show that activation of only a small portion of these microfractures can increase the total fracture/formation contact area considerably and, consequently, increase initial production. Reservoir-pressure changes caused by production might partially close or reopen these microcracks during production; hence, the effectiveness of these microfractures could be mainly restricted to the early life of the reservoirs.","http://onepetro.org/SJ/article-pdf/19/05/761/2100113/spe-163872-pa.pdf",""

Theoretical calculations performed at the level of the local density approximation, Hubbard U correction, and hybrid functional are complemented with the spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) of epitaxial films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. For the rutile phase, the local density approximation (LDA) gives the best description and predicts Fermi surface nesting consistent with wave vectors that lead to niobium-niobium dimerization during the phase transition. For the insulating phase, LDA provides a good quantitative description of the lattice, but only a qualitative description for the band gap. Including a Hubbard U correction opens the band gap at the expense of correctly describing the valence band and lattice of both phases. The hybrid functional slightly overestimates the band gap. Ellipsometric measurement is consistent with insulating behavior with a 1.0 eV band gap. Comparison with the theoretical dielectric functions, obtained utilizing a scissors operator to adjust the LDA band gap to reproduce the ellipsometry data, allows for identification of the SE peak features.","http://aip.scitation.org/doi/am-pdf/10.1063/1.4903067",""

An excitonic transition at 5.901 eV and its longitudinal optical phonon replica at 5.735 eV were observed. The excitonic emission line is blue shifted by about 130 meV with respect to that in hBN bulk crystals due to the effects of reduced dimensionality.

However, obesity may impact the reliability of age estimations based on pelvic joints. Over the past several decades, the prevalence of obesity has dramatically increased in the United States (US). Since the rate of progression through age‐related stages of weight‐bearing joints may be influenced by excessive body mass, it is important that anthropologists understand how obesity affects age‐related morphological changes in the skeleton. This study investigates the effects of obesity on the validity of the estimated age‐at‐death based on the Buckberry–Chamberlin and Suchey–Brooks methods by comparing US adults considered normal BMI (BMI 18.5–24.9) and obese (BMI ≥ 30). The obese group exhibits overall greater bias (overestimation of age) and inaccuracy, less precision, and lower correlations between estimated and known age than the normal BMI group using both methods, although differences in the pubic symphysis are not statistically significant. For the auricular surface the age of transition from one phase to the next is lower and the standard deviations are greater for the obese as compared to normal weight individuals. This study helps to elucidate how obesity affects the rate of age‐related skeletal change of the human pelvis, and shows that the pubic symphysis may be a more reliable indicator of age in obese individuals and that greater standard deviations are needed for obese individuals when estimating age‐at‐death from the pelvis.

PTEN is mutated or absent in more than half of human endometrial cancers. The major pathologic phenomenon of endometrial cancer is the loss of ovarian steroid hormone control over uterine epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis. Mig-6 suppresses estrogen signaling. Here, we show the significance of MIG-6 in human endometrial cancer through sample analysis, where MIG-6 expression is inversely associated with ERK phosphorylation; this relationship is tightly correlated with endometrial cancer progression. To determine the tumor suppressor function of Mig-6 in the development of endometrial cancer, we generated Mig-6 conditional overexpression mice (R26Mig-6LSL). To assess the effects of Mig-6 on the PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in uterine tumorigenesis, mice with Pten floxed (Ptenf/f) and R26Mig-6LSL were bred to the PRCre mouse model to generate overexpression of Mig-6 and ablation of Pten in the uterus (PRcre/+ R26Mig-6LSL Ptenf/f). PRcre/+ R26Mig-6LSL Ptenf/f showed significantly increased survival time and uterine weight compared to PRcre/+ Ptenf/f mice. Gross morphology and histological analysis displayed dramatically suppressed development of endometrial cancer in double mutant mice compared to ablation of Pten alone. Immunohistochemical analysis showed significantly increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation in epithelial cells of PRcre/+ R26Mig-6LSL Ptenf/f mice compared to PRcre/+ Ptenf/f mice. Interestingly, the expression of pERK1/2 was significantly decreased in PRcre/+ R26Mig-6LSL Ptenf/f mice compared to PRcre/+ Ptenf/f mice. To examine whether inhibition of ERK phosphorylation suppresses tumor progression in endometrial cancer, PRcre/+Ptenf/f mice were treated with U0126, an effective inhibitor of MAPK/ERK kinase. PRcre/+Ptenf/f mice treated with U0126 exhibited a significant reduction in uterine weight. Histopathological analysis of the entire animal cohort showed that inhibition of ERK phosphorylation suppressed endometrial cancer progression in PRcre/+ Ptenf/f mice, as reflected by the arrest of tumors at the hyperplastic or normal stage, whereas tumors from PRcre/+Ptenf/f mice treated with vehicle advanced to endometrial cancer. These results demonstrate that activation of ERK signaling is critical for endometrial cancer development and progression in Pten mutation. Our findings highlight a crucial tumor suppressor role for MIG-6 in progression of PTEN-null endometrial cancer by inhibiting ERK phosphorylation. As MIG-6 is a mediator of progesterone signaling, the activity of which can suppress unopposed-estrogen signaling, our studies provide a potential new drug target for the intervention of metastatic human endometrial cancer.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/74/19_Supplement/60/597955/Abstract-60-Mig-6-suppresses-development-and",""

Although those AA that are not synthesized in eukaryotes (nutritionally essential AA, EAA) must be present in animal diets, nutritionally nonessential AA (NEAA) have long been ignored for all species. Emerging evidence shows that nonruminants cannot adequately synthesize NEAA or conditionally essential AA (CEAA) to realize their growth or anti-infection potential. Likewise, all preformed AA are needed for high-producing cows and rapidly growing ruminants. Many NEAA and CEAA (e.g., arginine, glutamine, glutamate, glycine, and proline) and certain EAA (e.g., leucine and tryptophan) participate in cell signaling, gene expression, and metabolic regulation. Thus, functions of AA beyond protein synthesis must be considered in dietary formulations to improve efficiency of nutrient use, growth, development, reproduction, lactation, and well-being in animals.","https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-animal-022513-114113",""

Across all four experiments, the results consistently show that measures of reflective cognitive capacity reasonably partitioned participants into two groups: those that were more likely, versus those that were less likely, to benefit from feedback intervention. Most notably, the fourth experiment replicates a study recently published in Behavioral Research in Accounting (Buchheit, Dalton, Downen, and Pippin 2012) and demonstrates that the study's primary finding was not generalizable to all participants.

Despite this important role, relatively little is known about the NC process, including NC members' actions and thought processes. Based on interviews of 20 U.S. public company NC members, including 16 chairs, we focus on two primary questions: (1) what is the extent of influence that the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) has over committee processes, and (2) to what extent are committee processes formalized (i.e., framed and acted upon in a mechanistic way)? We find that there is continuing recognition of CEO influence in the director nomination process, the level of which varies widely by company. Also, there is considerable variability in the formalization of the director nomination process (e.g., some NCs use search firms and a matrix/grid approach to assessing director skill sets across the board, while others do not). Finally, we find that many interviewees have professional or personal ties to the CEO and that nearly all of the NCs focus on “chemistry” and comfort in the director nomination process, where the often‐stated goal is to enhance the board's ability to function effectively and to reduce risk in the director nomination process. The overall message of the interviews perhaps is best captured by one interviewee, who described a “strange little dance.” Throughout the interviews, we find evidence that the NC must “dance” through a complex decision landscape.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2F1911-3846.12044",""

The argument has been made that basic research is intended to generate new knowledge, whereas applied research is intended to apply knowledge to the solution of practical (social and organizational) problems. I will argue that the distinction between basic and applied research in symbolic interaction is outdated and dysfunctional. The masters of symbolic interactionist thought have left us a proud legacy of shaping their scholarly thinking and inquiry in response to and in light of practical issues of the day (e.g., Park and Blumer). Current interactionist work continues this tradition in topical areas such as social justice studies. Applied research, especially in term of evaluation and needs assessment studies, can be designed to serve both basic and applied goals. Symbolic interaction provides three great resources to do this. The first is its orientation to dynamic sensitizing concepts that direct research and ask questions instead of supplying a priori and often impractical answers. The second is its orientation to qualitative methods, and appreciation for the logic of grounded theory. The third is interactionism's overall holistic approach to interfacing with the everyday life world. The primary illustrative case here is the qualitative component of the evaluation of an National Institutes of Health‐funded, translational medical research program. The qualitative component has provided interactionist‐inspired insights into translational research, such as examining cultural change in medical research in terms of changes in the form and content of formal and informal discourse among scientists; delineating the impact of significant symbols such as “my lab” on the social organization of science; and appreciating the essence of the self‐concept “scientist” on the increasingly bureaucratic and administrative identities of medical researchers.

We designed an effective set of features and used them as input to Naïve Bayes classifiers.

To counter its myth of an infinitely expandable, omniscient perspective, Debord focused on reducing views from above to ‘derisory documents’ of the social and the environmental through détournement in the two films he made while the Situationist International was in existence. The films engage critically with aerial photography as a hegemonic mode of indexical media, with the aerial view’s application as information image and ornament, and with the formal phenomenon of ciné-mapping. This analysis suggests that the détournement Debord performs in and across these films can be best conceptualized as a critical optic that constitutes a practice of seeing, a mode of reception and a call to action in the social space beyond its aesthetic employ. As such, the optic of détournement is the contestational counterpart to the optic of the aerial view. This remains the case despite the contemporary complexity of photographic views from above and their increased abstraction of social agents and spaces. An alternative to the testimonial function of embodied photographic views, détournement as optic represents an indexical civil contract founded upon representational inadequacy.","https://intellectdiscover.com/content/journals/10.1386/pop.5.1.19_1?crawler=true&mimetype=application/pdf",""

In 2010, we became cautiously optimistic regarding the recovery of the species on the Griffith League Ranch, one of the toad's primary recovery sites, after an unusually successful reproductive season. Subsequently, the extreme drought throughout Texas deepened, culminating in the fall 2011 high-severity wildfires throughout the Lost Pines ecoregion. After the drought and wildfires, we continued to intensively monitor Houston toads via anuran call surveys, drift fence arrays, and visual observations of reproduction. Our objective was to investigate the dynamics of the Houston toad population on the Griffith League Ranch during these dramatic impacts to its habitat and to discuss the potential for Houston toad recovery in the ecoregion. In summary, both a simulation model and our field monitoring data suggest the Houston toad population on the Griffith League Ranch is at critically low numbers and may be extirpated in the near future if human-mediated recovery strategies are not continued and refined. We do not discern any evidence to suggest the 2011 wildfires have had any direct detrimental impacts on subsequent Houston toad population dynamics. Still, high-resolution data will be needed in the future to quantify how the wildfires affected Houston toad viability over the medium and long term.","http://meridian.allenpress.com/jfwm/article-pdf/5/2/363/1701341/112013-jfwm-071.pdf",""

There is a need to investigate the more heuristic biopsychosocial model, which incorporates the simultaneous contributions of medical, psychological, and social variables in understanding pain. Methods: Patients with SSc (n = 333) received clinical examinations and completed self‐report surveys at enrollment in the Genetics versus Environment in Scleroderma Outcome Study. Latent profile analysis was used to derive biopsychosocial profiles of patients using skin thickening, percent predicted forced vital lung capacity, perceived physical health, health worry, mental health, and social support. The profiles were examined in relation to pain and pain medication usage. Results: A 3‐profile solution provided the best fit to the data. Based on the biopsychosocial indicators, the profiles were characterized as managing (n = 217), resilient (n = 86), and distressed (n = 30). Between‐group differences for pain emerged, with the distressed group, whose disease was less severe than the resilient group, reporting the highest pain and the greatest utilization of pain medication. Conclusion: Clinicians should consider biopsychosocial characteristics as contributing factors to the experience of pain in patients with SSc. Patients who are similar to those in the distressed profile may be at an increased risk for pain and would likely benefit from a referral to a behavioral health or other ancillary service provider for pain management, rather than relying solely on pharmacologic therapies.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Facr.22171",""

The purpose of this population-based study was to describe the association between timing of referral to a cardiac center and mortality in 2360 liveborn neonates with CCHD. METHODS:: Neonates with CCHD born before pulse oximetry screening (1996–2007) were selected from the Texas Birth Defects Registry and linked to state birth and death records. Age at referral was ascertained from date of first cardiac procedure at a cardiac center. Logistic and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate factors associated with late referral and mortality; the Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate 3-month survival. RESULTS:: Median age at referral was 1 day (25th–75th percentile: 0–6 days). Overall, 27.5% (649 of 2360) were referred after age 4 days and 7.5% (178 of 2360) had no record of referral. Neonatal mortality was 18.1% (277 of 1533) for those referred at 0 to 4 days of age, 9.0% (34 of 379) for those referred at 5 to 27 days of age, and 38.8% (69 of 178) for those with no referral. No improvement in age at referral was found across the 2 eras within 1996–2007. CONCLUSIONS:: A significant proportion of neonates with CCHD experienced late or no referral to cardiac specialty centers, accounting for a significant number of the deaths. Future population-based studies are needed to determine the benefit of pulse oximetry screening on mortality and morbidity.","https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-pdf/134/1/e98/1058113/peds_2013-2895.pdf",""

Since the evaluation of building energy consumption usually requires building energy profiles on an hourly basis, which often is not available for existing buildings, the hourly energy consumption must be estimated. The dynamic behavior of the weather conditions and building operation makes computer simulations a good practice for reliable solutions. However, an energy building computer simulation requires a significant amount of experience, time, and effort to enter detailed building parameters, which is a drawback for a cost-effective solution. Therefore, simplified models based on statistics or a combination of statistics and simulations may be a better solution with reasonable uncertainty. This paper presents a tool to estimate hourly building energy consumption for existent office buildings. The proposed tool, developed in Microsoft Excel, uses simulation data from EnergyPlus Commercial Reference Buildings to convert monthly energy consumption from utility bills into hourly energy consumption.

However, a potentially important factor that has been overlooked is the certainty with which people make their responses. The present research establishes that the certainty with which people respond to scales is associated with stability of the scale responses over time and correspondence between the scale and related outcomes. In addition, the effects of certainty in political ideological identification in predicting politically relevant outcomes hold when controlling for a number of previously established moderators. This research suggests that measuring certainty in answers to individual‐difference scales can be a useful and efficient way to increase the predictive utility of those scales within the political domain and beyond. This benefit is demonstrated with need for cognition (Study 1), need to evaluate (Study 2), and ideological identification (Studies 2 and 3).","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fpops.12104",""

Codon bias, when synonymous codons are used at unequal frequencies, occurs in a wide variety of taxa. Standard evolutionary models explain the maintenance of codon bias through a balance of genetic drift, mutation and weak purifying selection. The efficacy of selection is expected to be reduced in regions of suppressed recombination. Contrary to observations in Drosophila melanogaster, some recent studies have failed to detect a relationship between the recombination rate, intensity of selection acting at synonymous sites, and the magnitude of codon bias as predicted under these standard models. Here, we examined codon bias in 2798 protein coding loci on the third chromosome of D. pseudoobscura using whole-genome sequences of 47 individuals, representing five common third chromosome gene arrangements. Fine-scale recombination maps were constructed using more than 1 million segregating sites. As expected, recombination was demonstrated to be significantly suppressed between chromosome arrangements, allowing for a direct examination of the relationship between recombination, selection, and codon bias. As with other Drosophila species, we observe a strong mutational bias away from the most frequently used codons. We find the rate of synonymous and nonsynonymous polymorphism is variable between different amino acids. However, we do not observe a reduction in codon bias or the strength of selection in regions of suppressed recombination as expected. Instead, we find that the interaction between weak stabilizing selection and mutational bias likely plays a role in shaping the composition of synonymous codons across the third chromosome in D. pseudoobscura.","http://academic.oup.com/g3journal/article-pdf/4/12/2433/37182318/g3journal2433.pdf",""

The present study refers to the National Epidemiological Study of Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) to assess narcissism, low self-control, and violence among a nationally representative sample. Using Latent Class Analyses (LCA), four classes of individuals are identified, and multinomial regression models indicate that narcissism and low self-control are associated with a range of violent acts among these groups. Most importantly, results show that the class of individuals that is high in narcissism and deficient in self-control is far and away the most prone to violence. Together, these findings lend important nationally representative support to recent experimental and meta-analytical conclusions suggesting that the co-occurrence of narcissism and low self-control has significant implications for our understanding of violence.

Our experimental evaluation using both real workloads and a micro-benchmark show that Triple-A can offer a 53% higher sustained throughput and a 80% lower I/O latency than non-autonomic SSD arrays.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2644865.2541953",""

The results show that the state-of-the-art global climate models still have significant difficulty in simulating the SEP stratocumulus clouds and associated cloud feedback. Comparing with observations, the models tend to simulate significantly less cloud cover, higher cloud top, and a variety of unrealistic cloud albedo. The insufficient cloud cover leads to overly weak shortwave CRF and net CRF. Only two of the eight models capture the observed positive cloud feedback at subannual to decadal time scales. The cloud and radiation biases in the models are associated with 1) model biases in large-scale temperature structure including the lack of temperature inversion, insufficient lower troposphere stability (LTS), and insufficient reduction of LTS with local SST warming, and 2) improper model physics, especially insufficient increase of low cloud cover associated with larger LTS. The two models that arguably do best at simulating the stratocumulus clouds and associated cloud feedback are the only ones using cloud-top radiative cooling to drive boundary layer turbulence.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jcli/article-pdf/27/8/3000/4031005/jcli-d-13-00376_1.pdf",""

Asphaltenes can block pore throats or change the formation wettability and thereby reduce the hydrocarbon mobility. Simulation of asphaltene precipitation during gas injection requires a comprehensive thermodynamic model, which accounts for the complex phase behavior of asphaltenes. In this paper, PC-SAFT EOS is implemented for the first time in a compositional reservoir simulator to model asphaltene precipitation. The additional computational time of PC-SAFT compared to the cubic equations-of-state such as Pen-Robinson (PR EOS) is decreased by improving its root finding algorithm. A deposition and wettability alteration model is then integrated with the thermodynamic model to simulate the dynamics of precipitated asphaltenes. Different gas injection scenarios are modeled to show the effect of gas injection on apshaltene precipitation and deposition.","http://onepetro.org/SPEATCE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/170697-MS/1493981/spe-170697-ms.pdf",""

Cultured primary hepatocytes from female human subjects expressing the FABP1 T94A variant exhibited increased neutral lipid (TG, cholesteryl ester) accumulation associated with 1) upregulation of total FABP1, a key protein stimulating mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAM), the rate-limiting enzyme in lipogenesis; 2) increased mRNA expression of key enzymes in lipogenesis ( GPAM, LPIN2) in heterozygotes; 3) decreased mRNA expression of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein; 4) increased secretion of ApoB100 but not TG; 5) decreased long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) β-oxidation. TG accumulation was not due to any increase in LCFA uptake, de novo lipogenesis, or the alternate monoacylglycerol O-acyltransferase pathway in lipogenesis. Despite increased expression of total FABP1 mRNA and protein, fenofibrate-mediated FABP1 redistribution to nuclei and ligand-induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-α) transcription of LCFA β-oxidative enzymes (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2, and acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1, palmitoyl) were attenuated in FABP1 T94A hepatocytes. Although the phenotype of FABP1 T94A variant human hepatocytes exhibits some similarities to that of FABP1-null or PPAR-α-null hepatocytes and mice, expression of FABP1 T94A variant did not abolish or reduce ligand binding.

Furthermore, the results provide initial evidence that IH is related to social bonds, as perceptions of IH were related to trust and higher forgiveness toward the religious leader, and positive attitudes towards the Sacred.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/009164711404200103",""

The second hypothesis points to sex differences in the shape of the nonlinear relationship between peer violence and respondent violence. We find that a decrease in the sex gap at higher levels of peer violence is due to (a) a stronger effect of peer violence exposure on individual violence for females than for males, and (b) a nonlinear peer violence/respondent violence relationship in the form of a decelerating curve that is consistent across the sexes.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0093854814544318",""

This paper integrates two strategies that improve safety for industrial manipulators in uncertain conditions. First, software compliance in the task space is implemented using force feedback. End-effector compliance is vital for many tasks, such as interacting with humans or manipulating uncertain payloads. Beyond compliance, a collision detection algorithm detects collisions based on joint torque deviation from a dynamic model. Collisions can be detected at any point along the manipulator via loading or impulse anomalies. Joint torque data is typically noisy, and the accuracy of the robot dynamic model is limited, so an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) was developed to improve the torque estimates. Experiments and demonstrations were performed using a commercially available 7DOF industrial robot. The EKF improved collision detection during unplanned contact tasks, and the method described here is hardware agnostic and extensible.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/DSCC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/DSCC2014-6330/4450099/v001t11a005-dscc2014-6330.pdf",""

The range- and time-dependent inversion problem is computationally intensive and a linearized perturbative algorithm was applied to obtain results in an efficient manner. The inversion algorithm uses estimates of modal travel time to determine sound speed as a function of range and depth. In order to handle the high volume of data associated with the acoustic sensing network, the modal travel time estimation process was automated using an adaptive time-frequency signal processing method known as time-warping. Time-warping is a model-based transform that converts the frequency-dependent modal arrivals to monotones in the warped domain where they can be easily filtered. The data analyzed in this paper were collected on 16 March 2011 on the New Jersey shelf when the ocean was relatively well-mixed. While the observed sound-speed variations are small, both spatial and temporal trends are observed in the results. Furthermore, the estimated sound-speed profiles show good agreement with temporally and spatially collocated measurements.","https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article-pdf/135/6/3316/13860730/3316_1_online.pdf",""

To develop the test, a sequence of systematic samples is defined via Walsh functions. Then the deviations of the autocovariances based on these systematic samples from the corresponding autocovariances of the whole time series are calculated and the uniform asymptotic joint normality of these deviations over different systematic samples is obtained. With a double-order selection scheme, our test statistic is constructed by combining the deviations at different lags in the systematic samples. The null asymptotic distribution of the statistic proposed is derived and the consistency of the test is shown under fixed and local alternatives. Simulation studies demonstrate well-behaved finite sample properties of the method proposed. Comparisons with some existing tests in terms of power are given both analytically and empirically. In addition, the method proposed is applied to check the stationarity assumption of a chemical process viscosity readings data set.","https://academic.oup.com/jrsssb/article-pdf/77/5/893/49234876/jrsssb_77_5_893.pdf",""

At 90D, total cholesterol, LDLs, and LDL particle concentration were higher in the Ω3 group compared to placebo (P < 0.05). Omega‐3 supplementation resulted in reduced plasma TGs and an increase in large LDL particle size concentration, yet had no effect on HDL particle size or concentration. Further research is necessary to examine the effects of increased Ω3 fatty acid intake in Hispanic women on dyslipidemia and related co‐morbidities.","",""

METHODS: The sample included an experimental group comprising 13 subjects aged between 7 and 10 years old, with Class II malocclusion and anterior open bite, and a control group comprising 22 subjects similar in age, sex and mandibular plane angle. Maxillary/mandibular, horizontal/vertical, dental/skeletal movements (ANS, PNS, U1, U6, Co, Go, Pog, L1, L6) were assessed, based on 14 landmarks, 8 angles (S-N-ANS, SNA, PPA, S-N-Pog, SNB, MPA, PP/MPA, ANB) and 3 linear measures (N-Me, ANS-Me, S-Go). RESULTS: Treatment caused significantly greater angle decrease between the palatal and the mandibular plane of the experimental group, primarily due to an increase in the palatal plane angle. ANB, SNA and S-N-ANS angles significantly decreased more in patients from the experimental group. PNS was superiorly remodeled. Lower face height (ANS-Me) decreased in the experimental group and increased in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The modified Thurow appliance controlled vertical and horizontal displacements of the maxilla, rotated the maxilla and improved open bite malocclusion, decreasing lower facial height.","http://www.scielo.br/pdf/dpjo/v19n1/2176-9451-dpjo-19-01-00019.pdf",""

A great deal of attention has been paid to handling a single missing covariate or a monotone pattern of missing data when the missingness mechanism is missing at random. In this article, we propose a semiparametric method for handling non‐monotone patterns of missing data. The proposed method relies on the assumption that the missingness mechanism of a variable does not depend on the missing variable itself but may depend on the other missing variables. This mechanism is somewhat less general than the completely non‐ignorable mechanism but is sometimes more flexible than the missing at random mechanism where the missingness mechansim is allowed to depend only on the completely observed variables. The proposed approach is robust to misspecification of the distribution of the missing covariates, and the proposed mechanism helps to nullify (or reduce) the problems due to non‐identifiability that result from the non‐ignorable missingness mechanism. The asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator are derived. Finite sample performance is assessed through simulation studies. Finally, for the purpose of illustration we analyze an endometrial cancer dataset and a hip fracture dataset.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fbiom.12159",""

As a result, SSDs may violate quality of service (QoS) requirements by not being able to meet the deadlines of I/O requests. In this paper, we propose a novel host interface I/O scheduler that is both GC-aware and QoS-aware. The proposed scheduler redistributes the GC overheads across non-critical I/O requests and reduces channel resource contention. Our experiments with workloads from various application domains reveal that the proposed scheduler reduces the standard deviation for latency over stateof- the-art I/O schedulers used in the HIL by 52.5%, and the worst-case latency by 86.6%. In addition, for I/O requests with sizes smaller than a superpage, our proposed scheduler avoids channel resource conflicts and reduces latency by 29.2% compared to the state-of-the-art","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2678373.2665715",""

For vital integrative evaluation of hepatic microsomal oxidation in rats, the hexobarbital sleep test was used. Content of cytochrome P450 was measured in hepatic microsomes. Activities of MAO‐A and MAO‐B were measured in the whole brain and brain structures. Content of serotonin, a MAO substrate was measured in the brain and plasma. Intensity of oxidative stress was evaluated by measuring lipid peroxidation products and carbonylated proteins in brain. Results. Rats with short hexibarbital sleep time (SHST) had higher content of microsomal cytochrome P450 than rats with long hexobarbital sleep time (LHST). Whole brain MAO‐A and MAO‐B activities, serotonin and carbonylated protein levels were higher in SHST than LHST rats. MAO‐A and MAO‐B activities were higher in brain cortex of SHST rats; only MAO‐A activity was higher in hypothalamus and medulla of LHST. The same brain regions of LHST rats had higher concentrations of carbonylated proteins and lipid peroxidation products. Conclusion. Data obtained in this study showed a correlation between MAO activity and microsomal oxidation phenotype. Rats with higher hepatic content of cytochrome P450 had higher activities of MAO‐A and MAO‐B in the brain and higher plasma serotonin levels than rats with lower microsomal oxidation. These correlations may reflect contribution of biogenic amines to regulation of cytochrome P450‐dependent monooxygenases and a role of cytochrome P450 in metabolism of biogenic amines and hormones regulating MAO activity including glucocorticoids","",""

The creep and recovery behavior of KPNC and solid virgin PP were performed by dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA) which allowed it to be studied extensively. The linear viscoelastic limit (LVL) was found at 1 MPa. Two popular creep models, the four‐element Burgers (FEB) model and the Findley power law (FPL) model, were used to model the creep behavior in this study. The FEB model was found only appropriate for characterizing short‐term creep behavior. In contrast, the FPL model was satisfactory for predicting the long‐term creep performance. The long‐term creep behavior of KPNC in comparison to virgin PP plastic was predicted using the time‐temperature superposition (TTS) principle. The 1‐year creep strains were estimated to be 0.32% for KPNC and 1.00% for virgin PP at 40°C. A three‐day creep test was conducted to validate the effectiveness of the TTS prediction. KPNC showed a better creep resistance and higher recoverability than the virgin PP, especially in a high‐temperature environment. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

In addition to its role in xenobiotic metabolism, PXR has pleiotropic functions in regulating immune/inflammatory responses, cell proliferation, bile acid/cholesterol metabolism, glucose and lipid metabolism, steroid/endocrine homeostasis, and bone metabolism. Recent research suggests that the PXR is required for maintaining healthy commensalism between microbiota and gut. Interestingly, the metabolites such as indole derivatives from commensal microbes serve as the ligands for the PXR in intestinal epithelium forming an intricate mutualistic interaction between host and microbiota. PXR‐regulated gene responses are controlled at epigenetic level by chromatin modifications, DNA methylation and noncoding RNA. Developmental alterations of the epigenome by exposure to the xenobiotics or diseases may produce persistent changes in PXR‐regulated physiological responses. These new areas of research promise to vastly increase our understanding of PXR‐regulated responses. In this review we highlight recent results on the epigenetic mechanisms for the PXR‐regulated gene expression and discuss the physiological significance of these findings. J. Cell.

As a result, it is important for teachers to determine the degree to which they implement evidence-based practices as intended to determine if an inadequate student response is due to poor implementation or inappropriate selection of intervention. The authors discuss the importance of fidelity of implementation. Methods teachers can use to measure implementation fidelity are reported. Suggested methods are discussed and examples are provided.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1053451214532348",""

While bullying is a significant problem for all students, students with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have a particularly high incidence rate of becoming victims of bullying. The social and communication deficits characteristic of students with ASD provide significant challenges in teaching and preparing these students for bullying situations. Cooperative work between teachers and parents, analyzing an individual student’s needs, educating the student about bullying, teaching how to cope with and reporting it in both controlled settings and natural environments, and developing a monitoring system are key components of preventing the students with ASD from being bullied.

General theory predicts that self-control will be negatively correlated with risk-taking, while ENA theory implies that these two variables should actually be positively correlated. According to ENA theory, traits such as pain tolerance and muscularity will be posi-tively associated with risk-taking and criminality while general theory makes no predictions concerning these relationships. Data from Malaysia and the United States are used to test 10 hypotheses derived from one or both of these theories. As predicted by both theories, risk-taking was positively correlated with criminality in both countries. However, contrary to general theory and consistent with ENA theory, the correlation between self-control and risk-taking was positive in both countries. General theory’s prediction of an inverse correlation between low self-control and criminality was largely supported by the U.S. data but only weakly supported by the Malaysian data.

Case Summary: An East Asian female in her mid-50s with a 25-year history of schizophrenia was prescribed fluvoxamine 150 mg daily, haloperidol decanoate 200 mg intramuscularly every 4 weeks, and benztropine 0.5 mg twice daily. Donepezil 5 mg daily was initiated for the treatment of possible dementia and 2 days later she appeared pale, displayed malaise, reported emesis, but was afebrile. The following day she was notably changed in behavior, withdrawn with a blunted affect. Decreased appetite, hyperthermia (temperatures 99.2-101°F), tachycardia, drooling, and slow, stiff movements with a creatine phosphokinase level of 1413 units/L (normal 26-192 units/L) were noted, and the patient was transferred to a medical hospital for treatment of suspected NMS. Symptoms improved with antipsychotic discontinuation, intravenous fluids, bromocriptine, and dantrolene. Five days after the adverse reaction the creatine phosphokinase significantly improved and she was noted to be more alert and responsive. Discussion: A literature search revealed 9 case reports of cholinesterase inhibitors causing NMS reactions either alone or, more commonly, when used in combination with antipsychotics. In this case, it was probable (Drug Interaction Probability Scale Score 6) the interaction between donepezil and haloperidol decanoate contributed to NMS. Conclusions: Use of cholinesterase inhibitors with antipsychotic medications may create an imbalance in acetylcholine and dopamine, which can precipitate the onset of NMS in susceptible individuals. These agents should be used cautiously in combination with careful monitoring for NMS.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/8755122514544526",""

Data were collected via online survey from 131 predominantly Hispanic college males; scale items were selected by exploratory factor analysis. Three moderately strongly correlated factors emerged, though they overlapped strongly and are currently considered only for future study. An 8-item short form of the BFSD scale (the BFSD-S) was created, as well. The full BFSD scale showed strong internal consistency and significant correlations with gender role attitudes, unequal/coercive relationship attitudes, history of misperceiving women’s platonic interest as sexual, history of sexual frustration in relationships, adult attachment, belief in immanent justice, attitudes toward intimate partner violence, and rape myth acceptance. Patterns of divergent correlations with other measures also supported the scale’s validity. The BFSD-S performed nearly identically to the BFSD.

To establish construct validity, CULA is embedded in a nomological network that extends the technology acceptance model (TAM). Specifically, CULA is posited to affect perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, the two underlying TAM constructs. Furthermore, we examine several antecedents of CULA by relying on the second language learning literature. These include computer anxiety, tolerance of ambiguity, and risk taking. Conceptualization of CULA is based on the observation that computer systems use language as communication between the computer and the user, making system usage significantly dependent on the ability of the individual to learn the language. We posit that learning to communicate with computer technology is akin to learning a second language, that is, a language learned after the first language(s) or native language(s), and is referred to as computerese. The proposed construct, CULA, measures the aptitude of an individual to learn computerese, and it is specified as a second-order variable. It includes measures of three critical facets of computerese pertaining to general hardware/software, programming, and the Internet. Significant relationships are found between computer anxiety, tolerance of ambiguity, and taking risk with CULA, as well as between CULA and TAM constructs.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0013164414520629",""

Evidence is mixed on its predictive utility relative to other self‐control measures but suffers from different studies operationalising the measure in different ways and mostly examining it with non‐offenders. Aims: This study aimed to investigate Hirschi's reconceptualisation of self‐control. Our research question was whether the number and salience of Hirschi's ‘costs’ are independently related to offending. Methods: Data on self‐perceptions of likelihood of driving while drunk and various self‐control and social control measures were collected by researchers during an orientation class for convicted offenders newly received into correctional facilities – one for men and one for women – during January to May 2011. Results: Eight hundred and nineteen men and 194 women completed the ratings. Both attitudinal and situational self‐control measures were independently associated with self‐rated likelihood of driving while drunk. These findings were confined to the male offenders. Conclusions: Findings revealed mixed support for Hirschi's conceptualisation of self‐control and its relevance. Situational and attitudinal measures of self‐control share some common ground but relate differently to offending according to gender. Further research is needed to find out if these results are generalisable to other crime types and whether race/ethnicity could modify the findings. Even among convicted offenders whose crimes are serious and/or frequent enough to result in imprisonment, high self‐control may inhibit offending. This has implications for intervention programmes. This is the first study to compare attitudinal and self‐control measures in relation to offending among a sample of incarcerated offenders and across gender.

The Trinity River of Texas was plagued by poor water quality for more than a century before passage of legislation to reduce point source pollution from the Dallas–Fort Worth (DFW) Metroplex. We tracked changes in components of flow regime; concentrations of ammonia, nitrate, phosphorus, and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD); and fish assemblage composition in three mainstem reaches during a 40‐year period (1968–2008) following implementation of a large‐scale cleanup initiative. Results suggest little change in flow regime components such as magnitude, timing, and rate of change among the three reaches during 1968–2008. Concentrations of water quality parameters declined through time and with greater distance from DFW, including the lowest concentrations in the reach downstream of a mainstem reservoir (Lake Livingston). Fish assemblage composition shifts correlated with attenuated nutrient and BOD concentrations, and species richness generally increased among all reaches. Native and intolerant fishes consistently increased through time among all three reaches, although lentic and non‐native species also increased downstream of Lake Livingston. Our findings suggest a revitalization of the Trinity River fish assemblage associated with reduced nutrient pollution in DFW (even among distant reaches) and also illustrate potential confounding factors such as stream impoundment and continued nutrient deposition that likely preclude complete recovery.

Across four studies, with different operational definitions of moral dyads and agency, we found evidence in favour of coherence perspectives. Social perceivers relied on mental states, character, and behavioural cues to make intentionality judgments. Further, intentionality attributions about behaviours were unrelated to inferences about agency. The discussion centres on the importance of coherent explanation in moral judgment.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fbjso.12077",""

The environmental fate and transport of steroid growth promoters suggest potential for endocrine‐disrupting effects among ecological receptors; however, the initial excretion of steroid metabolites from cattle administered growth promoters has not been well characterized. To better characterize excretion of trenbolone acetate and estrogen metabolites, steers were assigned to 1 of the following treatment groups: control, given no implant, or treatment, administered a combination implant (200 mg trenbolone acetate, 40 mg estradiol). Blood, urine, and fecal samples were collected over the course of 112 d following implantation. Samples were extracted and analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry for trenbolone acetate and estrogen metabolites. In both urine and feces, 17α‐trenbolone and 17α‐estradiol were the predominant metabolites following implantation. Mean concentrations of 17α‐trenbolone and 17α‐estradiol in feces of implanted steers were 5.9 ± 0.37 ng/g and 2.7 ± 0.22 ng/g, respectively. A best‐fit model is presented to predict 17α‐trenbolone and 17α‐estradiol excretion from steers receiving implants.

DFIT entails injection of water above the formation-parting pressure, followed by a long-duration pressure-falloff test. This test is a pragmatic method of gaining critical reservoir information (e.g., the formation-parting pressure, fracture-closure pressure, and initial- reservoir pressure), leading to fracture-completion design and reservoir-engineering calculations. In typical field operations, pressure is measured at the wellhead, not at the bottom of the hole, because of cost considerations. The bottomhole pressure (BHP) is obtained by simply adding a constant hydrostatic head of the water column to the wellhead pressure (WHP) at each timestep. Questions arise whether this practice is sound because of significant changes in temperature that occur in the wellbore, leading to changes in density and compressibility throughout the fluid column. This paper explores this question and offers an analytical model for estimating the transient temperature at a given depth and timestep for computing the BHP. Furthermore, on the basis of the premise of a line-source well, we have shown that the early-time data can be represented by the square-root of time formulation, leading to the new modified Hall relation for the injection period.","http://onepetro.org/JCPT/article-pdf/53/03/161/2147659/spe-166120-pa.pdf",""

In many studies, fractures are assumed to have no preferential orientation for slip along the fracture plane. However, examination of fractures found in recovered cores or in exposed outcrops shows irregularities, such as hackles or slickensides, which are formed in the direction of joint/fault propagation. These irregularities, represented as sawtooth ridges, can be expected to facilitate movement in a particular direction more than the opposite direction, in a way that depends on the height and shape of the irregularities. As a result, fractured rocks should exhibit a different compliance for shear in one direction compared with shear in the opposite orientation. We used numerical modeling to offer a critical assessment of this phenomenon by directly calculating the change in normal and shear compliance in the presence of hackles. The effect of the geometry of the hackles, the friction coefficient between fracture surfaces, and the role of normal stresses on the ratio of normal-to-shear fracture compliance were evaluated.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/geo2013-0227.1",""

The AFC under study consists of unidirectional long piezoelectric ceramic fibers embedded in an epoxy polymer, encapsulated between two Kapton layers with interdigitated surface electrodes. The relaxation and creep experiments are performed by loading the AFC samples along the longitudinal axis of the fibers, under several strain and stress levels at three temperatures, namely 25 °C, 50 °C, and 75 °C. The experimental results reveal the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior of the composite. Next, simulation and prediction of the viscoelastic response, including stress relaxation and creep deformation of the material, are done by using semi-analytical QLV model in which a relaxation time-dependent function is used, which also depends on strain and temperature. The results from the model are compared with those from the experiments. In general, the experimental and simulation results are in good agreement, except in the case of some of the creep responses, where considerable discrepancies are seen between the experimental and analytical approaches.

In this setting, conflicts can arise between developers and users from divergent interests concerning the release of functionalities in the project. The release of functionalities is influenced by reuse, i.e., the effort spent by the development team to write code that can be reused within the same project or in future projects. For example, the development team may choose to spend extra effort to make certain portions of the system reusable because doing so could reduce the effort needed to develop the entire system. However, the additional effort spent on reuse could delay the release of certain critical functionality, making such a strategy suboptimal for the users. Thus, optimal reuse decisions for developers and users could be different. In addition, from the firm's perspective, reuse decisions must not only balance the objectives of developers and users for the current project, but reuse effort may be spent to benefit future projects. Our study also highlights the fact that reuse may not always be beneficial for the firm. To this end, we consider different instances of the user–developer conflict and provide transfer pricing schemes that operate under information asymmetry and achieve two key properties: firm-level optimality and truth revelation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1757",""

While there is no doubt that the built environment is instrumental to human achievement and wellbeing, what is the true value of the ill-formed, and perhaps ill-conceived, products of today’s leading architects? This essay argues that the elite power structure behind high-profile architectural projects is focused more upon promoting like-minded architects, and their narrow ideological interests, than in satisfying the ordinary everyday user. In doing so, this activity irrevocably damages the environment and markedly diminishes human neuro-physiological engagement with the man-made world.

The key point is that phase transformations are modelled as strain-induced, which involves a completely different kinetic description than for traditional pressure-induced PTs. The model takes into account, contact sliding with Coulomb and plastic friction at the boundaries between the sample, gasket, and anvil. A comprehensive computational study of the effects of the kinetic parameter, ratio of the yield strengths of high and low-pressure phases and the gasket, sample radius, and initial thickness on the PTs and plastic flow is performed. A new sliding mechanism at the contact line between the sample, gasket, and anvil called extrusion-based pseudoslip is revealed, which plays an important part in producing high pressure. Strain-controlled kinetics explains why experimentally determined phase transformation pressure and kinetics (concentration of high pressure phase vs. pressure) differ for different geometries and properties of the gasket and the sample: they provide different plastic strain, which was not measured. Utilization of the gasket changes radial plastic flow toward the center of a sample, which leads to high quasi-homogeneous pressure for some geometries. For transformation to a stronger high pressure phase, plastic strain and concentration of a high-pressure phase are also quasi-homogeneous. This allowed us to suggest a method of determining strain-controlled kinetics from experimentation, which is not possible for weaker and equal-strength high-pressure phases and cases without a gasket. Some experimental phenomena are reproduced and interpreted. Developed methods and obtained results represent essential progress toward the understanding of PTs under compression in the DAC. This will allow one optimal design of experiments and conditions for synthesis of new high pressure phases.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.4873460/15133276/163509_1_online.pdf",""

Distilling key lessons from this literature, our review tries to establish a foundational understanding of the conditions, methods, implications, and strategies of entry timing so that research might be reinvigorated in this domain.

We explore four issues we deem to be important in understanding the role of neuroscience in organizational behavior research: (i) neuroscientific research and reductionism; (ii) the need to address methodological and technological challenges in conducting this type of research; (iii) how neuroscientific research is meaningful in organizations (the “So what?” issue); and (iv) neuroscience as just another management fad. In addressing these issues, we hope to set out a roadmap that will enable organizational scholars to avoid past mistakes and thus serve to advance multidisciplinary research in organizational behavior using neuroscientific approaches.

L-FABP (LKO) or L-FABP/SCP-2/SCP-x [triple-knockout (TKO)] ablation markedly decreased hepatic bile acid concentration, while SCP-2/SCP-x [double-knockout (DKO)] ablation alone had no effect. In contrast, LKO increased biliary bile acid, while DKO and TKO had no effect on biliary bile acid levels. LKO and DKO also altered biliary bile acid composition to increase bile acid hydrophobicity. Furthermore, LKO and TKO decreased hepatic uptake and biliary secretion of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-derived 22-( N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-23,24-bisnor-5-cholen-3β-ol (NBD-cholesterol), while DKO alone had no effect. Finally, LKO and, to a lesser extent, DKO decreased most indexes contributing to cholesterol solubility in biliary bile. These results suggest different, but complementary, roles for L-FABP and SCP-2/SCP-x in biliary bile acid and cholesterol formation. L-FABP appears to function more in hepatic retention of bile acids as well as hepatic uptake and biliary secretion of HDL-cholesterol.

Several sources of Fermi level pinning have been proposed including oxidation of the III-V substrate.[2, 3] In order to minimize the presence of III-V oxides it is crucial to employ either an ex-situ etch or to use an in-situ method such as atomic hydrogen cleaning.[4, 5] Although atomic H cleaning of III-V surfaces is well known, it has never been demonstrated on InGaAs (110) crystallographic faces. Furthermore, tri-gate field effect transistors (finFETs) have recently been employed in commercially available logic chips.[6] This unique device architecture allows for a reduction in short channel effects, minimization of the subthreshold swing, and a higher transconductance.[7] The InGaAs (110) surface would be the sidewalls of a vertically aligned (001) based finFETs.[8] Therefore, it is essential to find an in-situ method to efficiently remove any oxides or contamination from the (110) surfaces that is also compatible with the (001) surface. In this study, STM was employed to determine if atomic hydrogen can be used to remove the native oxide from air exposed InGaAs (110) samples.

Roadway agencies are left to decide the minimum retroreflectivity thresholds with which they are comfortable—if retroreflectivity is monitored at all—and how they will achieve these thresholds within the ever-expanding market of choices. This paper summarizes the results of an NCHRP project that developed a recommended laboratory test to predict the initial retroreflectivity of pavement markings in the field on the basis of the quality of the glass beads. This effort consisted of two key components: a laboratory test and a field verification. The study considered only AASHTO M 247 Type I glass beads in 15-mil waterborne paint. The research team developed a drawdown laboratory test to determine the potential retroreflectivity in the lab. The test was calibrated and validated with a field test. The drawdown is rapid (preparation and testing takes 24 h), repeatable and reproducible, cost-effective, and easy to use.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/2440-12",""

Using abiotic and biotic environmental variables, we developed a terrestrial habitat suitability model for this species on Kauai to predict habitat that could be suitable in the absence of anthropogenic threats. In addition, we developed a habitat/threat-isolation index incorporating information from our suitability model to identify regions of structurally suitable habitat with less exposure to certain anthropogenic threats (relative to other portions of the island). The habitat suitability model suggests that slope, density of rock fragments within the soil, and native vegetation cover are important factors associated with the current known distribution of the Newell's shearwater on Kauai, and that a moderate portion of the sloped interior terrain of Kauai could potentially be suitable nesting habitat for this species. The habitat/threat-isolation index identified the mountains on the north-central portion of the island as structurally suitable habitat most isolated from a combination of major anthropogenic disturbances (relative to other portions of the island). Much of this region, however, is privately owned and not designated as an official reserve, which could indicate a need for increased conservation action in this region in the future. This information is important for conservation biologists and private landowners because expanding efforts to control nonnative predators, as well as management of additional lands as reserves, may be necessary for the protection and preservation of the Newell's shearwater.","http://meridian.allenpress.com/jfwm/article-pdf/5/2/315/1701368/112013-jfwm-074.pdf",""

We consider the use of various income inequality measures in addition to a poverty measure and investigate their effects on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) mortality. In doing so, we make use of models that can capture zero inflation and spatiotemporal effects. The research is motivated by the lack of studies from an inference and modelling perspectives in explaining HIV mortality by using measures that take into account socio-economic status as well as time and location. Such a study can help policy makers to identify cases of environmental injustice and areas of outstanding health risk to assist in resource allocation problems. In our numerical example, we make use of mortality data obtained for the state of New York, estimate model parameters from a Bayesian inference perspective and discuss the implications and interpretations of various income inequality measures. The methodological novelty of our study is the introduction of a zero-inflated Poisson model that can account for both spatial and temporal effects across 5 years (2000–2004). The practical novelty of our study is its attempt to find inequality measures which can improve our understanding of HIV mortality risk. Our results indicate that, for the data at hand, if inequality is calculated on the basis of county-specific income shares rather than the whole state, HIV mortality can be better explained. In addition, accounting for temporal and spatial effects was found to contribute to our understanding of HIV mortality risk.","https://academic.oup.com/jrsssa/article-pdf/178/2/383/49338628/jrsssa_178_2_383.pdf",""

We then formulated an ETE scheme in the time-space domain by introducing a cosine function approximation. Although the ETE operator appears to be similar to the second-order temporal finite-difference (FD) operator, the exact nature of the ETE formula ensures high accuracy in time. We further introduced a set of optimum stencils and coefficients by minimizing evolution errors in a least-squares sense. Our numerical tests indicated that ETE can achieve similar waveform accuracy as FD with four times larger time steps. Meanwhile, the compact ETE operator keeps the computation efficient.

In this work, we report the detection of 7-(1′,2′-dihydroxyheptyl)-1,N6-ethenodeoxyadenosine (DHHedA) in rodent and human tissues by two independent methods: a 32P-postlabeling/HPLC method and an isotope dilution liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry method (ID-LC-ESI-MS/MS). This study demonstrated for the first time that DHHedA is a background DNA lesion in vivo. We showed that DHHedA can be formed upon incubation of arachidonic acid (AA) with deoxyadenosine (dA), supporting the notion that n-6 PUFAs are the endogenous source of DHHedA formation. Because the cyclic adducts are derived from the oxidation of PUFAs, we subsequently examined the effects of antioxidants, α-lipoic acid, polyphenon E and vitamin E on the formation of DHHedA and γ-hydroxy-1,N2-propanodeoxyguanosine (γ-OHPdG), a widely studied acrolein-derived cyclic adduct arisen from oxidized n-3 and n-6 PUFAs, in the livers of Long Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats. LEC rats are inflicted with elevated lipid peroxidation and prone to the development of hepatocellular carcinomas. The results showed that while the survival of LEC rats was increased significantly by dietary α-lipoic acid, none of the antioxidants inhibited the formation of DHHedA and only polyphenon E treatment decreased the formation of γ-OHPdG. In contrast, vitamin E caused an increase in the formation of both γ-OHPdG and DHHedA in the livers of LEC rats.

The incidence of stroke in adulthood increases with advancing age, but there is little understanding of how poststroke treatment should be tailored by age. Objective. The goal of this study was to determine if age and task specificity of rehabilitative training affect behavioral improvement and motor cortical organization after stroke. Methods. Young and aged mice were trained to proficiency on the Pasta Matrix Reaching Task prior to lesion induction in primary motor cortex with endothelin-1. After a short recovery period, mice received 9 weeks of rehabilitative training on either the previously learned task (Pasta Matrix Reaching), a different reaching task (Tray Reaching), or no training. To determine the extent of relearning, mice were tested once weekly on the Pasta Matrix Reaching Task. Mice then underwent intracortical microstimulation mapping to resolve the remaining forelimb movement representations in perilesion motor cortex. Results. Although aged mice had significantly larger lesions compared with young mice, Pasta Matrix Reaching served as effective rehabilitative training for both age-groups. Young animals also showed improvement after Tray Reaching. Behavioral improvement in young mice was associated with an expansion of the rostral forelimb area (“premotor” cortex), but we failed to see reorganization in the aged brain, despite similar behavioral improvements. Conclusions. Our results indicate that reorganization of motor cortex may be limited by either aging or greater tissue damage, but the capacity to improve motor function via task-specific rehabilitative training continues to be well maintained in aged animals.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1545968314541329",""

Dead on arrival (DOA), non-ambulatory (NA), and total dead and down (D&D) data were collected and skin surface temperatures of the pigs were measured by infrared thermography. Data were collected during winter (Experiment 1) and fall/spring (Experiment 2). Total D&D percent showed no interaction between bedding level and outside air temperature in any experiments. Average skin surface temperature during unloading increased with outside air temperature linearly in both experiments (P < 0.01). In conclusion, over-use of bedding may be economically inefficient.

Rock physical analysis showed that the presence of a vuggy-fracture porosity system combined with the fluids’ effect complicate the elastic responses of heterogeneous carbonates. This also gives physical insight into how the elastic properties of different lithofluid classes can be distinguished. With the application of Bayesian linearized amplitude variation with offset inversion, we found that the posterior distribution of P- and S-wave velocities were reliably extracted, whereas the inverted density tended to show high uncertainty due to a lack of wide angle data in the migrated seismic gathers. Finally, a Bayesian approach was implemented to propagate uncertainty from prestack seismic data to lithofluid classes in an integrated framework. The gas-carbonate predictions with high posterior probabilities were consistent with well observations at the well location and the present geological continuity. The probability distributions for the anhydrite, limestone, and dolostone were essential to understand the reservoir architecture and delineate the reservoir heterogeneities. We also ascertained that the uncertainty of lithofacies prediction is determined by the uncertainty of seismic inversion as well as the uncertainty of the link between lithofacies to their corresponding elastic responses.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/geo2013-0406.1",""

In particular, some researchers have concluded that the source of low-frequency motions is in the upstream boundary layer, whereas others have argued for a downstream instability as the driving mechanism. Owing to substantial recent activity, we are close to developing a comprehensive understanding, albeit only in simplified flow configurations. A plausible model is that the interaction responds as a dynamical system that is forced by external disturbances. The low-frequency dynamics seem to be adequately described by a recently proposed shear layer entrainment-recharge mechanism.

Squirrel monkeys were given single or multiple doses of an anti-B cell antibody (Rituximab) and/or an anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody (7pt-3F9) which resulted in a complete CD20+lymphocyte depletion and transient CD8+lymphocyte depletion as compared to control animals. The animals remained clinically well, suggesting that the intensity and/or duration of immune suppression were inadequate to trigger pathogenic reactivation of the latent polyoma and herpes viruses. Quantitative PCR assays revealed excretion of the SMPyV in the urine within one week after the 7pt-3F9 infusion, continuing until the end of the study. At necropsy, spleen, liver, lymph nodes, cerebrum, cerebellum and kidney were positive for SMPyV DNA. Histologic and immunohistochemistry studies revealed moderately increased numbers of meningeal cells and inflammatory mononuclear cells in the kidney, renal medulla and foci of increased Ki67 staining in distal tubular epithelial cells in antibody treated monkeys compared to untreated monkey. One animal had multifocal encephalitis with prominent CD3+lymphocyte collections throughout the cortex. These results suggest that the transient depletion of CD8+lymphocytes may be a useful trigger for SMPyV shedding.","https://journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article/192/1_Supplement/185.12/53720/Intensive-immune-suppression-of-Bolivian-squirrel",""

Tilletia buchloëana Kellerman and Swingle)] shifts sex ratios of buffalograss to be nearly 100% phenotypically hermaphroditic.

In female sex forms, pistil smut infection resulted in a 26 fold increase in ovary production and a 35 fold increase in potential harvest index. In male sex forms, pistil smut infection resulted in 2.37 fold increase in floret number and over 95% of these florets contained a well-developed pistil. Although all ovaries of infected plants are filled with fungal teliospores and hence reproductively sterile, an average male-female pair of infected plants exhibited an 87 fold increase in potential harvest index compared to their uninfected clones.

Our results show antibody arms radiating from the sides of the gp120 protomers at a range of angles and place the antibody-bound V3 loop in an orientation that differs from that predicted by most current models but consistent with the idea that antibody binding dislodges the V3 loop from its location in the Env spike, making it flexible and disordered.

Thin films were grown on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrate using pulsed laser deposition. Raman spectroscopic data combined with the X-ray diffraction analyses confirm body centered tetragonal crystallographic structure 0.5BZT-0.5 BCT thin films on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si. Polarization studies demonstrate that these 0.5BZT-0.5BCT films exhibit a large remnant and saturation polarization of 37 μC/cm2 and 40 μC/cm2, respectively, with a coercive field of 140 kV/cm. A correlation between polarization dynamics, structural distortion, and phonon vibration is established. The splitting of X-ray diffraction peak of the thin film in the 2θ range of 44.5° to 46.5° represents high degree of tetragonality. The tetragonality factor calculated by Rietveld analysis was found to be 0.006 and can be a major cause for the increased remnant polarization value. It is established from Raman spectra that the non-centrosymmetricity due to the displacement of Ti/Zr ions from its octahedral position is related to the peak position as well as the broadening of the A1 (LO) optical phonon mode. This increase of broadness in the thin film causes an increase in the dipole moment of the unit cell and, hence, the net increase in polarization values.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.4871673/15131060/154102_1_online.pdf",""

The dimer minimum-mode following method can be used to find such saddle points. But as we show, dimer searches that are initiated from a reactant state of interest can converge to saddles that are not on the boundary of the reactant state. These disconnected saddles are not directly useful for calculating the escape rate. Additionally, the ratio of disconnected saddles can be large, especially when the dimer searches are initiated far from the reactant minimum. The reason that the method finds disconnected saddles is a result of the fact that the dimer method tracks local ridges, defined as the set of points where the force is perpendicular to the negative curvature mode, and not the true ridge, defined as the boundary of the set of points which minimize to the reactant. The local ridges tend to deviate from the true ridge away from saddle points. Furthermore, the local ridge can be discontinuous and have holes which allow the dimer to cross the true ridge and escape the initial state. To solve this problem, we employ an alternative definition of a local ridge based upon the minimum directional curvature of the isopotential hyperplane, κ, which provides additional local information to tune the dimer dynamics. We find that hyperplanes of κ = 0 pass through all saddle points but rarely intersect with the true ridge elsewhere. By restraining the dimer within the κ &lt; 0 region, the probability of converging to disconnected saddles is significantly reduced and the efficiency of finding connected saddles is increased.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.4898664/14111822/164111_1_online.pdf",""

Research Method: The research design involved a cross-sectional survey instrument completed by 218 full-time faculty teaching in 53 different University Council for Educational Administration university principal preparation programs. We performed descriptive analysis of Likert-type scale responses with cross-tabulation of selected survey questions and constant comparative analysis of open-ended questions. The descriptive analysis provides a one-moment-in-time snapshot of the perceptions of particular education leadership faculty. As such, the data are illustrative of certain patterns evident across the national sample rather than definitive of these programs. Findings: Findings indicate that LGBTIQ identities and themes are only marginally integrated into U.S. principal preparation programs, inclusive of those identified as social justice programs. Social justice programs that do address LGBTIQ identities frequently depend on one faculty member or course to do so, rather than being integrated throughout the program. Implications for Research and Practice: Strategies are clearly needed for integrating LGBTIQ equitable leadership into U.S. principal preparation. More fundamentally, the study challenges the manner in which social justice discourses are constructed. It suggests that the quality of social justice preparation is appropriately measured, in part, and enhanced by the form of communal engagement with identities and experiences marginal within the social justice discourse itself.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0013161X14532468",""

To that end, novel thesaurus evaluation and thesaurus conversion metrics that exploit this characteristic are presented. The ontology conceptualization methodology is demonstrated through the development of a manufacturing thesaurus, referred to as ManuTerms. The concepts in ManuTerms can be converted into ontological classes. The whole conceptualization process is the stepping stone to developing more axiomatic ontologies. Although the proposed methodology is developed in the context of manufacturing ontology development, the underlying methods, tools, and metrics can be applied to development of any domain ontology.

(2) What does transformational learning look like for physical education teacher candidates in a physical education teacher education program? (3) From the point of view of the university instructor, what are the challenges training physical education teacher candidates to promote health awareness? Data collection sources include: The researcher's journal, informal conversations with physical education teacher education university colleagues from different institutions, alumni questionnaire responses, electronic communications with 11 physical education teacher education program graduates, and documents (e.g., the National Association for Sports and Physical Education Standards, and the Physical Education Teacher Education Standards). The authors draw on transformational learning theory as a framework to inform the study, and narrative analysis plays a central role reporting study findings. The chapter includes the following sections: a theoretical framework section discussing how transformational learning theory informs the study; a relevant literature section that provides the definition, benefits, and connection with concepts such as physical activity, community health, and effective teaching in physical education; a qualitative methodology section that describes the study setting and participants; data collection sources and data analysis procedures; a study findings section that is organized by research questions; an implications for practice section; and conclusion.","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=113619",""

Academic and clinical requirements during the entry-level education could potentially impact the decisions and directions these students choose to pursue as young professionals. Objective: To determine the difference in professional involvement of athletic trainers (ATs) based upon their participation in professional activities while completing their entry-level athletic training program (ATP). Design: Online surveys to determine ATP requirements of students and to determine the involvement of ATs in 5 professional activities after their certification by the Board of Certification. Perception questions were also included. Patients or Other Participants: Included 120 ATs from across the United States. All AT participants graduated within the 2004–2005 academic year and obtained certification in 2005. Data Collection and Analysis: Online surveys were administered through PsychData. The McNemar test was used to determine changes in participation levels of participants as students and as professionals. Frequency of yes/no responses was used to present perceptions, and participants' comments were included in the discussion section. Results: Student participation in community service, mentoring other students, and submitting presentation proposals did influence participation in these activities as a professional. However, professional involvement was not influenced by student membership in organizations, research, or mentoring by a health care professional. Conclusions: Participation in some professional activities as students should be encouraged or required in order to promote continued participation in these activities when the students become athletic training professionals.","http://meridian.allenpress.com/atej/article-pdf/9/1/12/1608389/090112.pdf",""

One explanation may be differing cancer treatment; however, few studies have examined this. Patients and Methods: We used HIV and cancer registry data from Connecticut, Michigan, and Texas to study adults diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, or cervical, lung, anal, prostate, colorectal, or breast cancers from 1996 to 2010. We used logistic regression to examine associations between HIV status and cancer treatment, adjusted for cancer stage and demographic covariates. For a subset of local-stage cancers, we used logistic regression to assess the relationship between HIV status and standard treatment modality. We identified predictors of cancer treatment among individuals with both HIV and cancer. Results: We evaluated 3,045 HIV-infected patients with cancer and 1,087,648 patients with cancer without HIV infection. A significantly higher proportion of HIV-infected individuals did not receive cancer treatment for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.67; 95% CI, 1.41 to 1.99), lung cancer (aOR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.80 to 2.64), Hodgkin's lymphoma (aOR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.33 to 2.37), prostate cancer (aOR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.31 to 2.46), and colorectal cancer (aOR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.38 to 3.72). HIV infection was associated with a lack of standard treatment modality for local-stage DLBCL (aOR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.50 to 2.72), non–small-cell lung cancer (aOR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.46 to 4.03), and colon cancer (aOR, 4.77; 95% CI, 1.76 to 12.96). Among HIV-infected individuals, factors independently associated with lack of cancer treatment included low CD4 count, male sex with injection drug use as mode of HIV exposure, age 45 to 64 years, black race, and distant or unknown cancer stage. Conclusion: HIV-infected individuals are less likely to receive treatment for some cancers than uninfected people, which may affect survival rates.","https://ascopubs.org/doi/pdfdirect/10.1200/JCO.2013.54.8644",""

Methods for estimating and interpreting interactions between latent variables within a structural equation modeling framework have recently become available. The latent moderated structural equations (LMS) method is one that is built into Mplus software. The potential utility of this method is limited by the fact that the models do not produce traditional model fit indices, standardized coefficients, or effect sizes for the latent interaction, which renders model fitting and interpretation of the latent variable interaction difficult. This article compiles state-of-the-science techniques for assessing LMS model fit, obtaining standardized coefficients, and determining the size of the latent interaction effect in order to create a tutorial for new users of LMS models. The recommended sequence of model estimation and interpretation is demonstrated via a substantive example and a Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, extensions of this method are discussed, such as estimating quadratic effects of latent factors and interactions between latent slope and intercept factors, which hold significant potential for testing and advancing developmental theories.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0165025414552301",""

Second and more important, we theoretically extend LGM by proposing a model validation criterion, namely “d-separation,” to evaluate why and when LGM works and test its fundamental properties and assumptions. Our d-separation criterion does not rely on any distributional assumptions of the data; it is grounded in the fundamental assumption of the theory of conditional independence. Third, we conduct extensive simulations to examine a multitude of factors that affect LGM performance. Finally, as a practical application, we apply LGM to model the relationship between word-of-mouth communication (online product reviews) and book sales over time with longitudinal 26-week data from Amazon.

Loss of PTEN and subsequent AKT activation stimulate estrogen receptor α–dependent pathways that play an important role in endometrial tumorigenesis. The major pathologic phenomenon of endometrial cancer is the loss of ovarian steroid hormone control over uterine epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis. However, the precise mechanism of PTEN/AKT signaling in endometrial cancer remains poorly understood. The progesterone signaling mediator MIG-6 suppresses estrogen signaling and it has been implicated previously as a tumor suppressor in endometrial cancer. In this study, we show that MIG-6 also acts as a tumor suppressor in endometrial cancers associated with PTEN deficiency. Transgenic mice, where Mig-6 was overexpressed in progesterone receptor–expressing cells, exhibited a relative reduction in uterine tumorigenesis caused by Pten deficiency. ERK1/2 was phosphorylated in uterine tumors and administration of an ERK1/2 inhibitor suppressed cancer progression in PRcre/+Ptenf/f mice. In clinical specimens of endometrial cancer, MIG-6 expression correlated inversely with ERK1/2 phosphorylation during progression. Taken together, our findings suggest that Mig-6 regulates ERK1/2 phosphorylation and that it is crucial for progression of PTEN-mutant endometrial cancers, providing a mechanistic rationale for the evaluation of ERK1/2 inhibitors as a therapeutic treatment in human endometrial cancer.

Molecularly thin films of BMPHA prepared by surface self-assembly have potential application as spatially selective layers in sensor designs. Either monolayer or bilayer films of BMPHA can be formed under ambient conditions, depending on the parameters of concentration and immersion intervals. Experiments with scanning probe-based lithography (nanoshaving and nanografting) were applied to measure the thickness of BMPHA films. The thickness of a monolayer and bilayer film of BMPHA on Au(111) were measured in situ with atomic force microscopy using n-octadecanethiol as an internal reference. Scanning probe-based nanofabrication provides a way to insert nanopatterns of a reference molecule of known dimensions within a matrix film of unknown thickness to enable a direct comparison of heights and surface morphology. Immersion particle lithography was used to prepare a periodic arrangement of nanoholes within films of BMPHA. The nanoholes could be backfilled by immersion in a SAM solution to produce nanodots of n-octadecanethiol surrounded by a film of BMPHA. Test platforms prepared by immersion particle lithography enables control of the dimensions of surface sites to construct supramolecular assemblies.","https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/19/9/13010/pdf",""

Four sprinkling methods were compared, with one treatment being randomly assigned to each load: control- no sprinkling (not applied in HOT weather), pigs only, bedding only, or pigs and bedding. Experiment 1 used 51 loads in WARM- and 86 loads in HOT weather to determine sprinkling effects on pig measures (surface temperature, vocalizations, slips and falls, and stress signs). Experiment 2 used 82 loads in WARM- and 54 loads in HOT weather to determine the sprinkling effects on transport losses (non-ambulatory, dead, and total transport losses). Experiment 1 found that, in WARM weather, there were no differences between sprinkling treatments for surface temperature, vocalizations, or slips and falls (p ≥ 0.18). However, stress signs were 2% greater when sprinkling pigs- or bedding only- compared to control (p = 0.03). Experiment 2 found that, in WARM and HOT weather, sprinkling did not affect non-ambulatory, dead, or total transport losses (p ≥ 0.18). Although the current study did not find any observed sprinkling effects for pig measures or transport losses it is extremely important to note that the inference space of this study is relatively small, so further studies should be conducted to see if these results are applicable to other geographical regions and seasons.","https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/4/2/164/pdf",""

We examined whether plasma adiponectin levels at baseline and after pioglitazone treatment in impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) subjects were associated with improved insulin sensitivity (SI) and glucose tolerance status. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 602 high-risk IGT subjects in ACT NOW were randomized to receive pioglitazone or placebo with a median follow-up of 2.4 years. RESULTS: Pioglitazone reduced IGT conversion to diabetes by 72% in association with improved β-cell function by 64% (insulin secretion/insulin resistance index) and increased tissue sensitivity by 88% (Matsuda index). In pioglitazone-treated subjects, plasma adiponectin concentration increased threefold from 13 ± 0.5 to 38 ± 2.5 μg/mL (P &lt; 0.001) and was strongly correlated with the improvement in SI (r = 0.436, P &lt; 0.001) and modestly correlated with glucose area under the curve during oral glucose tolerance test (r = 0.238, P &lt; 0.005) and insulin secretion/insulin resistance index (r = 0.306, P &lt; 0.005). The increase in adiponectin was a strong predictor of reversion to normal glucose tolerance and prevention of T2DM. In the placebo group, plasma adiponectin did not change and was not correlated with changes in glucose levels. There was an inverse association between baseline plasma adiponectin concentration and progression to diabetes in the placebo group but not in the pioglitazone group. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline adiponectin does not predict the response to pioglitazone. The increase in plasma adiponectin concentration after pioglitazone therapy in IGT subjects is strongly related to improved glucose tolerance status and enhanced tissue sensitivity to insulin.","https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/37/6/1706/621638/1706.pdf",""

Recent work in the field of psychoneuroimmunology suggests that inflammation may be one mechanism underlying these associations. In this article, we provide a brief overview of the literature on early-life stress and inflammation and how psychological, autonomic, neuroendocrine, and epigenetic responses to the early environment lead to potentiated inflammation in adulthood.

The goal of this study was to define the function of Osx in the post-natal growth of the secondary cartilage at the mandibular condyle. Conditional Osx knockout (cKO) mice that were missing Osx only in cartilage were generated by crossing Osx-loxP mice to Aggrecan-Cre mice. Cre activity was induced by tamoxifen injection twice a week from day 12 to 1 mo of age, and specimens were collected at 1 and 5 mo of age. At 1 mo of age, the condylar hypertrophic chondrocyte zone in the cKO-mice was > three-fold thicker than that in the age-matched control, with little sign of endochondral bone formation. Immunohistochemistry and analysis of histological data revealed a defect in the coupling of chondrogenesis and osteogenesis in the cKO mice. In five-month-old mice examined to address whether late-stage removal of the Cre-deletion event would alleviate the phenotype, the hypertrophic chondrocyte zone in the cKO condyles was considerably larger than in wild-type mice. There were large discrete areas of calcified cartilage in the hypertrophic zone, few signs of endochondral bone formation, and large regions of disorganized intramembranous bone. Analysis of these data further strengthens the notion that Osterix is essential for the coupling of terminal cartilage differentiation and endochondral ossification in mandibular condylar cartilage.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0022034514549379",""

The seven-member STAT family is composed of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors that are activated by phosphorylation intertwined in a network with activation that ultimately leads to cell proliferation. An activated kinase enzyme phosphorylates one STAT factor or more, which shuttle to the nucleus to regulate gene expression, promoting cell survival. Somatic STAT3 mutations have been recently reported in large granular lymphocytic leukemia, aplastic anemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome. Furthermore, the relationship between BCL6 and STAT3 in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, particularly on the activated B-cell subtype, needs to be further explored. The search for therapeutic STAT3 inhibitors that abrogate the JAK/STAT pathway is currently under way. Targeting the STAT pathway, which seems to be critical in tumorigenesis, is promising for multiple malignancies including lymphoma and leukemia. In this paper, we review mechanisms of action, failures, and successes of STAT3 inhibitors.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1634/theoncologist.2013-0407",""

Results showed that presence of a VIS and a greater proclivity to approach emotions were associated with significantly greater sentencing recommendations. Moreover, change in negative affect mediated the effects of NFA approach and VIS exposure. Examination of changes in specific negative emotions revealed that increases in being upset and nervous mediated the impact of VIS condition; in addition, increases in hostility mediated the effect of NFA approach.

Different factors such as the termination of the graphene edge, contact area, and point defect in contacted graphene are investigated. Notable differences are observed in structural configurations and electronic transport characteristics of these metal-graphene contacts, depending on the metal species and aforementioned influencing factors. It is found that the enhanced chemical reactivity of the graphene due to dangling bonds from either the unsaturated graphene edge or point defects strengthens the metal-graphene bonding, leading to a considerable contact resistance reduction for weakly interacting metals Au and Ag. For stronger interacting metals Pt and Cu, a slightly reduced contact resistance is found due to such influencing factors. However, the wetting metals Ni and Pd most strongly hybridize with graphene, exhibiting negligible dependence on the above influencing factors. This study provides guidance for the optimization of metal-graphene contacts at an atomic scale.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.4876738/15135048/183708_1_online.pdf",""

More than three-quarters of all defined protein coding genes (79%) were expressed in these cells. The increased sensitivity of RNA-seq compared with previous microarray studies revealed that the RNA levels for 31% of expressed genes were affected two-fold or more by exposure to light. Additionally, a large class of mRNAs, enriched for transcripts specifying products involved in rRNA metabolism, showed decreased expression in response to light, indicating a heretofore undocumented effect of light on this pathway. Based on measured changes in mRNA levels, light generally increases cellular metabolism and at the same time causes significant oxidative stress to the organism. To deal with this stress, protective photopigments are made, antioxidants are produced, and genes involved in ribosome biogenesis are transiently repressed.","http://academic.oup.com/g3journal/article-pdf/4/9/1731/37181535/g3journal1731.pdf",""

In this article, we use data from more than 12,000 U.S. state and federal prisoners to examine sentence length disparities between Mexican- and native-born citizens. Our primary finding is that while there may be some impact of being Mexican born on sentence length, the negligible differences indicate that offenders who are Mexican born are likely to receive shorter sentences than their native-born counterparts, controlling for a variety of legal and extralegal factors.

Insufficient evidence of the mechanisms by which GATA2 contributes to this process precludes complete understanding of a key determinant of tissue-specific AR activity. Our observations suggest that GATA2 facilitates androgen-responsive gene expression by three distinct modes of action. By occupying novel binding sites within the AR gene locus, GATA2 positively regulates AR expression before and after androgen stimulation. Additionally, GATA2 engages AR target gene enhancers prior to hormone stimulation, producing an active and accessible chromatin environment via recruitment of the histone acetyltransferase p300. Finally, GATA2 functions in establishing and/or sustaining basal locus looping by recruiting the Mediator subunit MED1 in the absence of androgen. These mechanisms may contribute to the generally positive role of GATA2 in defining AR genome-wide binding patterns that determine androgen-responsive gene expression profiles. We also find that GATA2 and FoxA1 exhibit both independent and codependent co-occupancy of AR target gene enhancers. Identifying these determinants of AR transcriptional activity may provide a foundation for the development of future prostate cancer therapeutics that target pioneer factor function.","http://academic.oup.com/nar/article-pdf/42/6/3607/37018721/gkt1382.pdf",""

In catalysis and polymer stabilization, thermal decomposition is of great importance. Hydrotalcites form easily with atmospheric carbon dioxide and often interfere with the study of other anion containing systems, particularly if formed at room temperature. The dehydroxylation and decomposition of carbonate occurs simultaneously, making it difficult to distinguish the dehydroxylation mechanisms directly. To date, the majority of work on understanding the decomposition mechanism has utilized hydrotalcite precipitated at room temperature. In this study, evolved gas analysis combined with thermal analysis has been used to show that CO2 contamination is problematic in materials being formed at RT that are poorly crystalline. This has led to some dispute as to the nature of the dehydroxylation mechanism. In this paper, data for the thermal decomposition of the chloride form of hydrotalcite are reported. In addition, carbonate-free hydrotalcites have been synthesized with different charge densities and at different growth temperatures. This combination of parameters has allowed a better understanding of the mechanism of dehydroxylation and the role that isomorphous substitution plays in these mechanisms to be delineated. In addition, the effect of anion type on thermal stability is also reported. A stepwise dehydroxylation model is proposed that is mediated by the level of aluminum substitution.","https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/7/10/7048/pdf",""

We study the relationship between family firm characteristics and the quality of internal control over financial reporting, relative to non-family firms. Using a relatively large sample of S&P 500 firms, we report that family firms exhibit more material weaknesses in their internal control over financial reporting than non-family firms. Further investigation suggests that the greater likelihood of material weaknesses is driven by family firms with dual-class shares. Our results are consistent with the entrenchment argument that family owners are motivated to maintain weaker internal controls in order to extract private benefits. Our study contributes to the extant literature on family firms by providing further insight into the mechanisms through which family firms can exert undue influence on internal control over financial reporting.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-horizons/article-pdf/29/1/41/14873/acch-50935.pdf",""

We compare the two mechanisms in a controlled laboratory environment, varying the entry cost, and find that, contrary to the theoretical predictions, average seller revenues tend to be higher under the sequential mechanism, whereas average bidder profits are approximately the same. We identify three systematic behavioral deviations from the theoretical model: (1) in the auction, bidders do not enter 100% of the time; (2) in the sequential mechanism, bidders do not set preemptive bids according to the predicted threshold strategy; and (3) subsequent bidders tend to overenter in response to preemptive bids by first bidders.

High-resolution nutrient profiles were obtained at different locations at each site during winter and summer using dialysis samplers. Areas of sulfate depletion were observed in the top 20 cm of dialysis samplers in the Fourchon marsh and mangrove sites. When sulfate depletion was observed, it was accompanied by an increase in the ammonia and/or phosphorous concentration signifying an anoxic zone in the sediment. This anoxic zone was found more frequently in summer sampling compared to winter sampling. Flux chamber were installed at each site to capture evolved CO2 to determine if carbon from the MC252 oil was being mineralized at each site. Carbon derived from oil and carbon derived from indigenous organic matter was differentiated using the stable carbon isotope ratio. d13C signatures of the bulk soil, root matter, and soil with roots removed were measured at depth to compare contaminated sites to nearby inland sites with little to no oil contamination. A d13C signature of −24.8 ± 0.8 ‰ was observed in the bulk soil of the contaminated shoreline site in the Port Fourchon Marsh while an adjacent uncontaminated inland bulk soil sample had a d13C signature of −17.3 ± 0.8 ‰. d13C signatures were measured for sample before and after being washed with a hexane acetone solvent which removed oil.

Osteocalcin, a protein secreted by osteoblast cells in bone, has recently emerged as an important metabolic regulator with insulin-sensitizing properties. In humans, osteocalcin levels are inversely associated with liver disease. We thus hypothesized that osteocalcin may attenuate NASH and examined the effects of osteocalcin treatment in middle-aged (12-mo-old) male Ldlr−/− mice, which were fed a Western-style high-fat, high-cholesterol diet for 12 weeks to induce metabolic syndrome and NASH. Mice were treated with osteocalcin (4.5 ng/h) or vehicle for the diet duration. Osteocalcin treatment not only protected against Western-style high-fat, high-cholesterol diet-induced insulin resistance but substantially reduced multiple NASH components, including steatosis, ballooning degeneration, and fibrosis, with an overall reduction in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity scores. Further, osteocalcin robustly reduced expression of proinflammatory and profibrotic genes (Cd68, Mcp1, Spp1, and Col1a2) in liver and suppressed inflammatory gene expression in white adipose tissue.

To determine whether MIF inhibition could reduce UVB light–induced inflammation and squamous carcinogenesis, a small-molecule MIF inhibitor (CPSI-1306) was utilized that disrupts homotrimerization. To examine the effect of CPSI-1306 on acute UVB-induced skin changes, Skh-1 hairless mice were systemically treated with CPSI-1306 for 5 days before UVB exposure. In addition to decreasing skin thickness and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, CPSI-1306 pretreatment increased keratinocyte apoptosis and p53 expression, decreased proliferation and phosphohistone variant H2AX (γ-H2AX), and enhanced repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. To examine the effect of CPSI-1306 on squamous carcinogenesis, mice were exposed to UVB for 10 weeks, followed by CPSI-1306 treatment for 8 weeks. CPSI-1306 dramatically decreased the density of UVB-associated p53 foci in non–tumor-bearing skin while simultaneously decreasing the epidermal Ki67 proliferation index. In addition to slowing the rate of tumor development, CPSI-1306 decreased the average tumor burden per mouse. Although CPSI-1306–treated mice developed only papillomas, nearly a third of papillomas in vehicle-treated mice progressed to microinvasive SCC.

The proposed ring includes actin, myosin, and α-actinin, and is organized into a structure similar to that of muscle sarcomeres. This structure justifies the use of the sliding-filament mechanism developed by Huxley and Hill, but it is probably less organized relative to that of muscle sarcomeres. Ring contraction tension was generated via the same fundamental mechanism used to generate muscle tension, but some physicochemical parameters were adjusted to be consistent with the proposed ring structure. Simulations allowed an estimate of ring constriction tension that reproduced the observed ring constriction velocity using a physiologically possible, self-consistent set of parameters. Proposed molecular-level properties responsible for the thousand-fold slower constriction velocity of the ring relative to that of muscle sarcomeres include fewer myosin molecules involved, a less organized contractile configuration, a low α-actinin concentration, and a high resistance membrane tension. Ring constriction velocity is demonstrated as an exponential function of time despite a near linear appearance. We proposed a hypothesis to explain why excess myosin heads inhibit constriction velocity rather than enhance it. The model revealed how myosin concentration and elastic resistance tension are balanced during cytokinesis in S. pombe.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.4896164/15488452/125101_1_online.pdf",""

The tests on divergent thinking and visual thinking are fully developed and validated; this paper focuses on the development of a test of abstract reasoning in the context of engineering design. Similar to the two previous papers, this paper reports on the theoretical and empirical basis for skill identification and test development. Cognitive studies of human problem solving and design thinking revealed four indicators of abstract reasoning: qualitative deductive reasoning (DR), qualitative inductive reasoning (IR), analogical reasoning (AnR), and abductive reasoning (AbR). Each of these is characterized in terms of measurable indicators. The paper presents test construction procedures, trial runs, data collection, norming studies, and test refinement. Initial versions of the test were given to approximately 250 subjects to determine the clarity of the test problems, time allocation and to gauge the difficulty level. A protocol study was also conducted to assess test content validity. The beta version was given to approximately 100 students and the data collected was used for norming studies and test validation. Analysis of test results suggested high internal consistency; factor analysis revealed four eigenvalues above 1.0, indicating assessment of four different subskills by the test (as initially proposed by four indicators).

We compared data from phase I and registration trials to determine whether early trials predicted later safety and final dose. We searched the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website for drugs approved in nonpediatric cancers (January 1990–October 2012). The recommended phase II dose (R2PD) and toxicities from phase I were compared with doses and safety in later trials. In 62 of 85 (73%) matched trials, the dose from the later trial was within 20% of the RP2D. In a multivariable analysis, phase I trials of targeted agents were less predictive of the final approved dose (OR, 0.2 for adopting ± 20% of the RP2D for targeted vs. other classes; P = 0.025). Of the 530 clinically relevant toxicities in later trials, 70% (n = 374) were described in phase I. A significant relationship (P = 0.0032) between increasing the number of patients in phase I (up to 60) and the ability to describe future clinically relevant toxicities was observed. Among 28,505 patients in later trials, the death rate that was related to drug was 1.41%. In conclusion, dosing based on phase I trials was associated with a low toxicity-related death rate in later trials. The ability to predict relevant toxicities correlates with the number of patients on the initial phase I trial. The final dose approved was within 20% of the RP2D in 73% of assessed trials.

Yet, few studies have considered evolutionary relationships among the integrated suite of structures associated with male reproduction. In this study, we examined nine species of lizards in the genus Anolis to determine whether larger copulatory morphologies and higher potential for copulatory muscle performance evolved in association with higher copulation rates. In 10–12 adult males of each species, we measured the size of the hemipenes and related muscles, the seminiferous tubules in the testes, and the renal sex segments in the kidneys, and we assessed the fiber type composition of the muscles associated with copulation. In a series of phylogenetically-informed analyses, we used field behavioral data to determine whether observed rates of copulation were associated with these morphologies.We found that species with larger hemipenes had larger fibers in the RPM (the retractor penis magnus, a muscle that controls hemipenis movement), and that the evolution of larger hemipenes and RPM fibers is associated with the evolution of higher rates of copulatory behavior. However, the sizes of the seminiferous tubules and renal sex segments, and the muscle fiber composition of the RPM, were not associated with copulation rates. Further, body size was not associated with the size of any of the reproductive structures investigated. The results of this study suggest that peripheral morphologies involved in the transfer of ejaculate may be more evolutionarily labile than internal structures involved in ejaculate production.","http://academic.oup.com/cz/article-pdf/60/6/768/32969762/czoolo60-0768.pdf",""

The current study used an experimental intelligence‐gathering paradigm to test the efficacy of two clusters of emotion‐based interrogation approaches from the US Army Field Manual. Results suggest that both Positive and Negative Emotional Approaches increased the collection of information from both guilty and innocent participants when compared with a Direct Approach. While the emotional approaches produced similar gains in information regardless of valence, positive approaches reduced anxiety, increased perceptions of a fostering atmosphere, and enhanced the relationship between fostering atmosphere and information gain.

We hypothesized that molecular markers of carcinogenesis in adenomas, measured via immunohistochemistry, may help identify high-risk patients. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a retrospective, 1:1 matched case–control study (n = 216; 46% female) in which cases were patients with colorectal cancer and synchronous adenoma and controls were patients with adenoma but no colorectal cancer at baseline or within 5 years of follow-up. In phase I of analyses, we compared expression of molecular markers of carcinogenesis in case and control adenomas, blind to case status. In phase II of analyses, patients were randomly divided into independent training and validation groups to develop a model for predicting case status. We found that seven markers [p53, p21, Cox-2, β-catenin (BCAT), DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNApkcs), survivin, and O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)] were significantly associated with case status on unadjusted analyses, as well as analyses adjusted for age and advanced adenoma status (P &lt; 0.01 for at least one marker component). When applied to the validation set, a predictive model using these seven markers showed substantial accuracy for identifying cases [area under the receiver operation characteristic curve (AUC), 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.74–0.92]. A parsimonious model using three markers performed similarly to the seven-marker model (AUC, 0.84). In summary, we found that molecular markers of carcinogenesis distinguished adenomas from patients with and without colorectal cancer. Furthermore, we speculate that prospective studies using molecular markers to identify individuals with polyps at risk for future neoplasia are warranted.

The cell proliferation, migration and angiogenic factors were evaluated in PNTTU-treated CTB cells. The PNTTU inhibited the CTBs proliferation and migration. The soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) secretion was increased while vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was decreased in the culture media of CTB cells treated with ≥1 nM PNTTU. The angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AT2) expression was significantly upregulated in ≥1 nM PNTTU-treated CTB cells in compared to basal; however, the angiotensin II receptor, type 1 (AT1) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR-1) expression was downregulated. The anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic effect of this compound on CTB cells are similar to the effect of CTSs.

Ridesharing has the potential to solve many environmental, congestion, pollution, and energy problems. In this paper, we introduce the problem of large scale real-time ridesharing with service guarantee on road networks. Trip requests are dynamically matched to vehicles while trip waiting and service time constraints are satisfied. We first propose two scheduling algorithms: a branch-and-bound algorithm and an integer programing algorithm. However, these algorithms do not adapt well to the dynamic nature of the ridesharing problem. Thus, we propose kinetic tree algorithms which are better suited to efficient scheduling of dynamic requests and adjust routes on-the-fly. We perform experiments on a large Shanghai taxi dataset. Results show that the kinetic tree algorithms outperform other algorithms significantly.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.14778/2733085.2733106",""

Rural adolescents are more likely to be physically inactive than urban youth, contributing to higher risk of obesity and chronic diseases. Study objectives were to: (1) identify perceived opportunities and barriers to youth physical activity within a rural area and (2) identify rural community characteristics that facilitate or inhibit efforts to promote youth physical activity. Methods: Thirty in‐depth interviews were conducted with expert informants in 2 rural southern US counties. Interviewees were recruited from diverse positions across multiple sectors based on their expert knowledge of community policies and programs for youth physical activity. Findings: Informants saw ball fields, natural amenities, and school sports as primary resources for youth physical activity, but they were divided on whether opportunities were abundant or scarce. Physical distance, social isolation, lack of community offerings, and transportation were identified as key barriers. Local social networks facilitated political action and volunteer recruitment to support programs. However, communities often lacked human capital to sustain initiatives. Racial divisions influenced perceptions of opportunities. Despite divisions, there were also examples of pooling resources to create and sustain physical activity opportunities. Conclusions: Developing partnerships and leveraging local resources may be essential to overcoming barriers for physical activity promotion in rural areas. Involvement of church leaders, school officials, health care workers, and cooperative extension is likely needed to establish and sustain youth rural physical activity programs. Allocating resources to existing community personnel and volunteers for continuing education may be valuable.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fjrh.12072",""

We found that (1) both observations and model results exhibit higher AMOC variability on seasonal and shorter time scales than on interannual and longer time scales; (2) on intraseasonal and interannual time scales, the AMOC variability is often coherent over a wide latitudinal range, but lacks an overall consistent coherent pattern over the entire North Atlantic; and (3) on seasonal time scales, the AMOC variability exhibits two distinct coherent regimes north and south of 20°N, due to different wind stress variability in the tropics and subtropics. The high AMOC variability south of 20°N in the tropical Atlantic comes primarily from the Ekman transport of the near‐surface water, and is modulated to some extent by the transport of the Antarctic Intermediate water below the thermocline. These results highlight the importance of the surface wind in driving the AMOC variability.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2F2014JC009994",""

Furthermore, starting in the mid-1990s (when aggregate mutual fund equity ownership is significantly higher), stocks traded by career-concerned herds of fund managers in response to analyst recommendation changes experience a significant same-quarter price impact, followed by a sharp subsequent price reversal.

The proliferation of sophisticated state tax planning techniques combined with the complexity of varying state tax regimes make multistate taxation an area rampant with uncertainty. The accounting standards contained in FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48) require firms to record and disclose liabilities for uncertain income tax benefits based on a more-likely-than-not merit threshold of each tax position, assuming tax authorities have full information. Theoretical work and initial practitioner claims suggested that the accounting standards would increase reported tax expense and tax payments. Consistent with this, we find that both firm-level state income tax expense and aggregate state-level income tax collections increased surrounding adoption of FIN 48, providing evidence of the association between mandatory financial reporting disclosures and tax compliance behavior.","https://publications.aaahq.org/jata/article-pdf/36/2/203/68440/atax-50766.pdf",""

The effect of stress triaxiality on failure strain is usually assessed by dynamic Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) or quasi-static tests of tension, compression, torsion, and shear. However, the stress triaxialities produced by these tests are considerably different from those in high speed machining of titanium alloys where adiabatic shear bands (ASB) are associated with much higher strains, stresses and temperatures. This aspect of shear localization and fracture are poorly understood in previous research. This paper aims to demonstrate the role of stress triaxiality in chip segmentation during machining titanium alloy using finite element method. This research promotes a fundamental understanding of thermo-mechanics of the high-speed machining process, and provides a logical insight into the fracture mechanism in discontinuous chips.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/MSEC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/MSEC2014-3915/4426937/v002t02a033-msec2014-3915.pdf",""

How do people assess how much they have learned? Recent theorizing has depicted emotion as a cue for learning, and so people may be misled by recent emotional states to infer that they have learned more than they actually have. Four studies showed that people associated emotion with learning and believed, often falsely, that they learned more when in an emotional than unemotional state. Factual lessons were coupled with manipulations of arbitrary, irrelevant emotional states. Participants rated that they learned more after an emotion had been induced than in emotionally neutral control conditions. These differences remained significant after controlling for actual learning as measured by objective tests, which was unaffected by emotion. This illusion of learning caused by emotion was robust with respect to changes of procedure and sample, including whether the emotion came before or after the information to be learned. Alternative explanations were ruled out, including that emotion would intensify ratings generally, that emotion would make incoming information seem particularly personally relevant, that emotion increased engagement in the research, and that illusory learning would depend on retrospective exaggeration of one's prior ignorance. Because irrelevant emotions can increase people's judgments that they have learned something, incidental emotional experiences could increase a person's likelihood of deciding to take another class with a particular instructor, to sign up for another leadership seminar, or to engage in a risky (but emotion‐filled) excursion.

Neotropical singing mice (Scotinomys) are diurnal, insectivorous rodents distributed throughout montane cloud forests of Middle America. Males commonly emit species-specific advertisement vocalizations that are used in mate attraction and male-male aggression. To explore factors contributing to vocal variation, we summarize data from a diversity of studies at disparate scales and levels of analysis. We highlight the importance of genetic drift in shaping population differentiation, the role of androgens in modulating the performance of physically challenging displays, the influence of social context in shaping posture and vocal parameters, and the impact of the ambient environment in affecting sound propagation. Neotropical singing mice are emerging as an important model that enables us to draw parallels to vocal communication systems in traditionally more tractable species.","https://pubs.aip.org/jasa/article/135/4_Supplement/2239/610576/Sources-of-acoustic-variation-in-the-advertisement",""

COP1 forms complexes with SUPPRESSOR OF PHYTOCHROME A (SPA) proteins, and these complexes degrade positively acting transcription factors in the dark to repress photomorphogenesis. Phytochrome-interacting basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors (PIFs) also repress photomorphogenesis in the dark. In response to light, the phytochrome family of sensory photoreceptors simultaneously inactivates COP1-SPA complexes and induces the rapid degradation of PIFs to promote photomorphogenesis. However, the functional relationship between PIFs and COP1-SPA complexes is still unknown. Here, we present genetic evidence that the pif and cop1/spa Arabidopsis thaliana mutants synergistically promote photomorphogenesis in the dark. LONG HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) is stabilized in the cop1 pif1, spa123 pif1, and pif double, triple, and quadruple mutants in the dark. Moreover, the hy5 mutant suppresses the constitutive photomorphogenic phenotypes of the pifq mutant in the dark. PIF1 forms complexes with COP1, HY5, and SPA1 and enhances the substrate recruitment and autoubiquitylation and transubiquitylation activities of COP1. These data uncover a novel function of PIFs as the potential cofactors of COP1 and provide a genetic and biochemical model of how PIFs and COP1-SPA complexes synergistically repress photomorphogenesis in the dark.","http://academic.oup.com/plcell/article-pdf/26/5/1992/37000296/plcell_v26_5_1992.pdf",""

It describes systemically how organizations attend to rules depending on the nature of the benefits of production compared with those of rule compliance. The model captures the operative mechanisms responsible for the development of pressures for production and for rule compliance in organizations, providing a structural explanation both for problem-prone organizations characterized by erosion of standards and increased violations and for organizations following rules more reliably.

Currently the most commonly used two-stream model considers the plant functional types (PFTs) within a grid to be independent of each other and their leaves to be horizontally homogeneous. This assumption is unrealistic in most cases. To consider canopy three-dimensional (3D) structural effects, a new framework of 3D canopy radiative transfer model was developed and validated by numerical simulations and shows a good agreement. A comparison with the two-stream model in the offline Community Land Model (CLM4.0) shows that an increase of canopy absorption mainly happens with sparse vegetation or with multilayer canopies with a large sun zenith angle θsun and is due to increases of the ground and sky shadows and of the optical pathlength because of the shadow overlapping between bushes and canopy layers. A decrease of canopy absorption occurs in densely vegetated areas with small θsun. For a one-layer canopy, these decreases are due to crown shape effects that enhance the transmission through the canopy edge. For a multilayer canopy, aside from these shape effects, transmission is also increased by the decreased ground shadow due to the shadow overlapping between layers. Ground absorption usually changes with opposite sign as that of the canopy absorption. Somewhat lower albedos are found over most vegetated areas throughout the year. The 3D model also affects the calculation of the fraction of sunlit leaves and their corresponding absorption.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jcli/article-pdf/27/3/1168/4022537/jcli-d-13-00155_1.pdf",""

The precise contribution of NAD(P)H in acrolein‐induced toxicity is not fully explored. We investigated the involvement of NAD(P)H oxidase in acrolein toxicity using gp91phox knock‐out (KO) mice. Male gp91 KO mice (20‐25 g) or wild type (WT) control were treated with acrolein (0.5 μg/kg; 1 week). Animals were sacrificed and liver was used for biochemical analysis. KO mice generated low (1.43±.02 pg/μg protein) free radical as evident by 8‐Isoprostane compare to the WT mice (2.19±0.1). Acrolein increased 8‐Isoprostane in WT (P<0.05) but not in KO mice. Xanthine Oxidase (XO) activity was higher (p<0.05) in KO (0.56±0.06 μunit/μg protein). Acrolein reduced XO in KO mice while significantly increased it in WT. Cycloxygenase (COX) activity was not different between WT and KO mice although acrolein increased COX in WT. KO mice exhibited a significantly low (2.1±0.2 μmol/mg protein) total antioxidant status (TAS) compared to the WT (3.5±0.3). Acrolein reduced TAS in both WT and KO mice in an equal manner. These data suggests that NAD(P)H oxidase contributes significantly in acrolein‐induced oxidative stress. We suggests that in absence of NAD(P)H oxidase XO and COX play a definitive role in this process. We also suggest that besides generating free radical, acrolein reduces antioxidant ability thus compounding the effects of oxidative stress.","",""

While it is shown that disruption of ERK3 gene causes neonatal lethality, cell type‐specific functions of ERK3 signaling remain to be explored. In this study, we report that ERK3 gene expression is upregulated by cytokines through c‐Jun in endothelial cells; c‐Jun binds to the ERK3 gene and regulates its transcription. We further reveal a new role for ERK3 in regulating endothelial cell migration, proliferation and tube formation by upregulating SRC‐3/SP‐1‐mediated VEGFR2 expression. The underlying molecular mechanism involves ERK3‐stimulated formation of a transcriptional complex involving coactivator SRC‐3, transcription factor SP‐1 and the secondary coactivator CBP.

This study evaluated the performance of the SLEUTH urban growth and land use change model through two independent model calibrations with different temporal extents (1972 to 2006 vs. 2000 to 2006) for the historical Italian cities of Pisa Province and their surroundings. The goal in performing two calibrations was to investigate the sensitivity of SLEUTH forecasts to longer or shorter calibration timelines, that is does calibrating the model over a longer time period produce better model fits and therefore forecasts? The best fit parameters from each calibration were then used in forecasting urban growth in the area up to the year 2027. The authors findings show that the spatial growth estimated by the model was strongly influenced by the physical landscape and road networks. The forecast outputs over 100 Monte Carlo trials reflect the start of newly formed detached settlements towards and along existing roads, i.e., classic urban sprawl. The authors conclude that the short term calibration was a better model fit compared to the long term calibration. Nevertheless, the absolute preference for the short-term calibration over long-term implies that time-sensitivity in calibration remains a challenge for SLEUTH applications.</p>","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=118257",""

We consider both pointwise and clusterwise spatial analyses, and derive oracle procedures which optimally control the false discovery rate, false discovery exceedance and false cluster rate. A data-driven finite approximation strategy is developed to mimic the oracle procedures on a continuous spatial domain. Our multiple-testing procedures are asymptotically valid and can be effectively implemented using Bayesian computational algorithms for analysis of large spatial data sets. Numerical results show that the procedures proposed lead to more accurate error control and better power performance than conventional methods. We demonstrate our methods for analysing the time trends in tropospheric ozone in eastern USA.","https://academic.oup.com/jrsssb/article-pdf/77/1/59/49269134/jrsssb_77_1_59.pdf",""

Voter ID laws have evolved from a valence issue into a partisan battle, where Republicans defend them as a safeguard against fraud while Democrats indict them as a mechanism of voter suppression. However, voter ID legislation is not uniform across the states; not all Republican-controlled legislatures have pushed for more restrictive voter ID laws. Instead, our findings show it is a combination of partisan control and the electoral context that drives enactment of such measures. While the prevalence of Republican lawmakers strongly and positively influences the adoption of voter ID laws in electorally competitive states, its effect is significantly weaker in electorally uncompetitive states. Republicans preside over an electoral coalition that is declining in size; where elections are competitive, the furtherance of restrictive voter ID laws is a means of maintaining Republican support while curtailing Democratic electoral gains.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1065912914554039",""

Subjects (n=24) were randomized in a crossover design with high (100 g/d) and low (50 g/d) intakes (4 wk) of sumac sorghum cereal incorporated in their normal diets. Sumac sorghum induced compositional changes in the fecal microbiota, such as an increase (q=0.076) in anti‐inflammatory Faecalibacterium prausnitzii species. Untargeted metabolomic analysis of plasma revealed reductions in amino acid (AA) metabolites as well as increases in microbially‐derived aromatic AA and polyphenol metabolites. 3‐hydroxyhippurate, a product of chlorogenic acid metabolism shown to be reduced in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance, was increased (q=0.0145) following sumac sorghum consumption. Three gamma‐glutamyl AAs produced by gamma‐glutamyl transferase, a biomarker for MS and cardiovascular risk, were decreased (q<0.05) with the 100 g intake.

Chi-square and descriptive statistics were used to understand the relationship between the teacher’s language and the linguistic areas. Lastly, using the same data set, we conducted a qualitative analysis in order to depict the situations in which the teacher employed the L1 and L2. There was a significant relationship between the teacher’s language and the FFEs’ linguistic areas. Specifically, the L1 and L2 were used equally when FFEs concerned vocabulary and grammar. However, when FFEs concerned semantics, frequent code-switching occurred. The qualitative data illustrate that the language choice may depend on the interactional patterns and the complexity of the linguistic structure.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1362168814541737",""

In operando characterization of such devices by scanning probe techniques is particularly well-suited for the microscopic study of these properties. We have developed a scanning probe microscope (SPM) which is capable of both standard force imaging (atomic, magnetic, electrostatic) and simultaneous electrical transport measurements. We utilize flexible and inexpensive FPGA (field-programmable gate array) hardware and a custom software framework developed in National Instrument's LabVIEW environment to perform the various aspects of microscope operation and device measurement. The FPGA-based approach enables sensitive, real-time cantilever frequency-shift detection. Using this system, we demonstrate electrostatic force microscopy of an electrically biased graphene field-effect transistor device. The combination of SPM and electrical transport also enables imaging of the transport response to a localized perturbation provided by the scanned cantilever tip. Facilitated by the broad presence of LabVIEW in the experimental sciences and the openness of our software solution, our system permits a wide variety of combined scanning and transport measurements by providing standardized interfaces and flexible access to all aspects of a measurement (input and output signals, and processed data). Our system also enables precise control of timing (synchronization of scanning and transport operations) and implementation of sophisticated feedback protocols, and thus should be broadly interesting and useful to practitioners in the field.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/rsi/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.4902934/15739520/123702_1_online.pdf",""

Peroxisome Proliferator Activated receptor alpha and gamma (PPARα and PPARγ) and their ability to influence oxidative stress (OS) has been the focus of inflammatory signaling. NAD(P)H oxidase is a source of free radical generation. This study investigated the influence of PPARα and γ ligands (clofibrate & GW1929) in attenuating oxidative stress in acrolein-induced insult. gp91phox knockout (KO) mice and age/weight matched wild type (WT) were treated with acrolein (0.5 μg/kg; i.p.; 7 days) with/without clofibrate (Clof: 250 mg/kg; i.p; 10 days) or GW1929 (5 mg/kg, gavage, 10 days). KO mice (1.44±0.14 pg/μg prt) had higher (97%) 8-Isoprostane in response to acrolein than WT (2.19±0.11 pg/μg prt). Clof had no effect on 8-Isoprostane but GW1929 reduced it in both WT and KO mice by 35% and 43% (p<0.05) respectively. There was a significant reduction in Total Antioxidant Status (TAS) which was more prominent in WT (69%) than KO (53%). Clof and GW1929 improved TAS in WT (21% and 19%). Xanthine Oxidase (XO) enzyme activity was higher in KO (0.53±0.05) than WT (0.35+0.02). Acrolein and clof increased XO activity in WT while GW1929 had no effect. Acrolein increased cycloxygenase (COX) in WT (4.58±0.3) and remained at basal level in KO. Clof and GW1929 reduced COX in WT (54% and 48% respectively). Clof reduced Cox only in KO mice (31%). NFκB activity was twice in acrolein treated WT and remained unchanged in KO. Both GW1929 and clof blunted this increase. Acrolein increased CD36 activity, an inflammatory marker, in KO (56%). Clof attenuated this increase in KO but increased it in acrolein treated WT. GW1929 blunted CD36 increase in KO mice but did not affect WT. These results suggest that in absence of a functioning NAD(P)H oxidase other oxygenase contributes in acrolein-induced oxidative stress and PPARα ligand, clofibrate, is beneficial via attenuating inflammatory signaling of NFκB and COX. We also suggest that beneficial effect of PPARγ ligand involves inhibition of NAD(P)H oxidase as in absence of NAD(P)H this effects are minimal.","",""

In this study, we propose VSRank, a novel framework that seeks accuracy improvement of ranking-based CF through adaptation of the vector space model. In VSRank, we consider each user as a document and his or her pairwise relative preferences as terms. We then use a novel degree-specialty weighting scheme resembling TF-IDF to weight the terms. Extensive experiments on benchmarks in comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate the promise of our approach.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2542048",""

Besides the global warming, the thermokarst pond, as a major heat source, speeds up the moisture change and degradation of its surrounding permafrost. To analyze the long‐term coupled moisture‐heat process near a representative nonpenetrative thermokarst pond in a permafrost region, abundant temperature data over multiple years at different depths and horizontal distances from the center of the thermokarst pond have been collected at a field experimental station in QTP. A numerical model is built to analyze this thermokarst pond. The temperature and moisture processes of surrounding permafrost are simulated by this model and compared with measured temperature data. Our results show that if the rate of air temperature rise is 0.048°C/yr, which refers to a 2.4°C temperature rise over 50 years, the thawing fronts underneath the thermokarst pond move downward at a linear rate of 0.18 m/yr and the permafrost beneath the pond center would disappear after the year of 2281. Beyond that time, the impact range of the pond on the natural ground increases to about 50 m in horizontal direction. So a dish‐shape thawing zone occurs around the thermokarst pond. Simultaneously, the moisture state is greatly changed in 2281 and becomes completely different from that in 2013. All of these would inevitably deteriorate the ecological and environmental system in QTP.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2F2013JF002930",""

Data were collected from 128 families with toddler age children (67 girls and 61 boys) during a laboratory assessment. Mother–toddler and father–toddler interactions were coded for shared positive and negative affect, as well as dyadic synchrony. Attachment status was assessed using the Strange Situation. Data revealed that securely attached parent–toddler dyads spent more time in synchronous interaction, and less time in asynchronous interaction, than insecurely attached parent–toddler dyads. Parent–toddler synchronous interaction among both securely and insecurely attached dyads was characterized by shared positive affect. Among insecure dyads, shared negative affect was more predominate in asynchronous than in synchronous interaction. The role of individual differences in the manifestation of synchronous interaction among securely and insecurely attached parent–toddler dyads is discussed.

Point-of-testing counselling is a method of promoting a healthy lifestyle during an individual’s most ‘teachable moment’. Design/Setting:: This longitudinal study examined the effects of school-based nutrition education and point-of-testing counselling on nutrition knowledge, weight, blood lipid profile and blood pressure over a 3-year period (2005–2008) among junior high and high school students from a rural community in the Southern USA. Methods:: Screening for health variables, followed by point-of-testing counselling sessions, was offered every 6 months, along with nutrition education once a week for 12 weeks. Statistical analyses were conducted using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). T-tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were conducted to analyse changes in health outcomes over the course of the study. Results:: A total of 233 rural students participated in this longitudinal community-based study. Students who attended at least four sessions ( n = 52) were analysed for changes in health outcomes. High-density lipoprotein levels significantly increased between the second and fourth visits.

Prenatal residences of 1,410 mothers reporting exclusive bottled water use were geocoded and mapped; 326 bottled water samples were collected and analyzed using Environmental Protection Agency Method 300.0. Median bottled water nitrate concentrations were assigned by community; mothers' overall intake of nitrate in mg/day from drinking water was calculated. Odds ratios for neural tube defects, limb deficiencies, oral cleft defects, and heart defects were estimated using mixed-effects models for logistic regression. Odds ratios (95% CIs) for the highest exposure group in offspring of mothers reporting exclusive use of bottled water were: neural tube defects [1.42 (0.51, 3.99)], limb deficiencies [1.86 (0.51, 6.80)], oral clefts [1.43 (0.61, 3.31)], and heart defects [2.13, (0.87, 5.17)]. Bottled water nitrate had no appreciable impact on risk for birth defects in the NBDPS.","http://iwaponline.com/jwh/article-pdf/12/4/755/395800/755.pdf",""

We demonstrate that XPC, a Rad23-binding protein, regulates p53 turnover. p53 protein in XPC-deficient cells remains ubiquitylated, but its association with the proteasome is drastically reduced, indicating that XPC regulates a postubiquitylation event. Furthermore, we found that XPC participates in the MDM2-mediated p53 degradation pathway via direct interaction with MDM2. XPC W690S pathogenic mutant is specifically defective for MDM2 binding and p53 degradation. p53 is known to become stabilized following UV irradiation but can be rendered unstable by XPC overexpression, underscoring a critical role of XPC in p53 regulation. Elucidation of the proteolytic role of XPC in cancer cells will help to unravel the detailed mechanisms underlying the coordination of DNA repair and proteolysis.","",""

The Kα emission was measured simultaneously using a highly ordered pyrolytic graphite crystal spectrometer and a curved quartz imaging crystal. The measured ratio of the integrated image signal to the integrated spectral signal was, within the experimental error, constant, indicating that the imaging efficiency's dependence on temperature is weak throughout the probed range. Based on our experience of target heating under similar conditions, we estimate a temperature of ∼200 eV for the smallest targets. The successful imaging of Kα emission for temperatures this high represents an important proof of concept for Zr Kα imaging.

We argue that women’s male partners’ pornography use could be integrated within objectification theory as another form of sexual objectification and negatively linked to women’s well-being. College women ( N = 171) rated how often their current and previous male partners viewed pornography and whether pornography use bothered them. They also completed measures of objectification theory constructs, internalization of cultural beauty standards, relationship attachment, self-esteem, body appreciation, and negative affect. The extent to which women were bothered by partner pornography use was controlled in all analyses. Path analysis revealed that previous partners’ pornography use (a) directly predicted interpersonal sexual objectification, internalization, and eating disorder symptomatology and (b) indirectly predicted body surveillance and body shame through internalization. In hierarchical regressions, previous partners’ pornography use inversely predicted self-esteem and body appreciation and positively predicted relationship anxiety and negative affect. Current partners’ pornography use was not linked to any criterion. Researchers should more comprehensively examine partners’ pornography use in relation to women’s distress. Practitioners may consider exploring male partners’ pornography use in female clients’ relationship histories and its potential associations with their well-being when relevant to them.

To study the individual contribution of FcγRIIB deficiency and 129-derived SLAM genes to loss of germinal center (GC) tolerance we compared B6 mice deficient in FcγRIIB (B6.RIIBKO) and B6 mice congenic for 129-derived SLAM locus (B6.129-SLAM) with B6-129.RIIBKO and B6 controls. B6-129.RIIBKO mice developed numerous spontaneous germinal centers (Spt-GCs) with increased size producing high titers of autoantibodies against nuclear (ANA) and other self-antigens, alongside a hyperactive T cell phenotype. We also observed elevated Spt-GC and T-cell responses in B6.RIIBKO and B6.129-SLAM mice than B6 mice although much lower when compared to B6-129.RIIBKO mice.

This study examined whether familial/demographic, developmental, diagnostic, or treatment‐related variables best predict the acute psychosocial adjustment and adaptive functioning of children soon after an initial diagnosis. Procedure: Participants included 56 children (mean age = 10.72, SD = 4.02) newly diagnosed with a pediatric brain tumor. Parents completed background/demographic forms and completed ratings of children's behavioral and emotional symptoms, and adaptive behavior. Diagnostic and treatment‐related information was abstracted from medical records. Results: Parent ratings of behavioral symptoms and adaptive functioning were within normative expectation, although rates of clinical impairment in adaptive functioning exceeded expected rates. A combination of familial/demographic and diagnostic variables were associated with acute functioning. In multiple regressions, tumor size best predicted adaptive functioning after initial diagnosis, whereas tumor location best predicted variance in behavioral symptoms. Conclusions: Children may be more vulnerable to acute impairment in adaptive functioning following diagnosis of a pediatric brain tumor, but rates of behavioral symptoms were within expectation. Familial, sociodemographic, and diagnostic variables may help to identify those most at risk of impairment. Screening of these factors within tertiary care settings will be useful to identify those most in need of psychosocial care during the initial phases of treatment.

This study examines the influence of prior strain—namely, child abuse and interparental violence—on officer critical incident strain, psychological–physiological stress responses, and officer-on-officer aggression. Data analyzed the stress responses of 1,104 police officers from the Police Stress and Domestic Violence in Police Families in Baltimore, Maryland, and results show that prior strain events influence respondents in three key ways. First, those reporting exposure to childhood strain had higher work-related strain scores. Second, youthful strain events and work-related critical incident strain are associated with increased stress. Finally, child abuse exposure and critical incident strain increases the odds of officer-on-officer violence among participants. The sample offers several important implications for strain theory because it includes only adult respondents and offers some degree of control for serious adolescent delinquency.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0734016814564696",""

Extant studies on compliance with security policies have largely ignored the impact of intrinsic motivation on employees' compliance intention. This paper proposes a theoretical model that integrates an intrinsic self‐regulatory approach with an extrinsic sanction‐based command‐and‐control approach to examine employees' IUP compliance intention. The self‐regulatory approach centers on the effect of organizational justice and personal ethical objections against internet abuses. The results of this study suggest that the self‐regulatory approach is more effective than the sanction‐based command‐and‐control approach. Based on the self‐regulatory approach, organizational justice not only influences IUP compliance intention directly but also indirectly through fostering ethical objections against internet abuses. This research provides empirical evidence of two additional effective levers for enhancing security policy compliance: organizational justice and personal ethics.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fisj.12037",""

We have taken an integrated genomics approach to reveal the CREB1/FoxA1-coregulated gene expression profile of ADPC (LNCaP) and CRPC (LNCaP-abl) cell line models. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation combined with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) was performed using antibodies against CREB1 and FoxA1 to reveal genome-wide TF binding sites. Our results indicate that these factors adopt divergent binding patterns in each cell line and that the CREB1 and FoxA1 cistromes exhibit a higher degree of overlap in CRPC vs. ADPC. RNA-seq was also performed in each cell line following transfection with Control-, FoxA1-, or CREB1-targeting small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules. We identified putative direct CREB1/FoxA1-coregulated genes by noting instances of TF binding near cooperatively coregulated genes (i.e. those up- or down-regulated by both CREB1 and FoxA1 knockdown). Unlike previous analyses, which found that cooperative TF activity occurs primarily in the event of TF co-occupancy of gene regulatory elements, we found that non-overlapping as well as overlapping CREB1/FoxA1 binding events were significantly enriched within cooperatively coregulated target gene loci compared to genes that were unresponsive to TF knockdown. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of LNCaP-abl-coregulated genes found that CREB1/FoxA1 enhance the expression of critical CRPC pathways including “DNA Repair” and “Aurora Kinase,” while they repress pathways such as “Apoptosis” and, consistent with previous findings, “Androgen Receptor Signaling.” Importantly, CREB1/FoxA1-up-regulated and down-regulated pathway elements exhibit overexpression or under-expression, respectively, in LNCaP-abl vs. LNCaP as well as in public gene expression datasets of metastatic vs. primary prostate cancer. Finally, we performed several proof-of-concept analyses to demonstrate that the CREB1/FoxA1-coregulatory pathway is sensitive to compounds that target CREB1 phosphorylation, a critical event in the transactivation of CREB1 mediated in large part by the related AGC kinase family members PKA and Akt/PKB. Together these results reveal that CREB1 and FoxA1 assume overlapping roles in determining the expression of genes/networks relevant to experimental models and clinical cases of advanced prostate cancer, and though targeting transcription factors has proven challenging, this coregulatory pathway may in fact represent a therapeutic target owing to its kinase-dependent activation.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/74/19_Supplement/1387/593280/Abstract-1387-Convergent-CREB1-FoxA1",""

We describe aspects of current attestation standards contributing to uncertainty with respect to the level of assurance that auditors should obtain when evaluating their clients' internal controls for purposes of SEC reporting, and evidence from regulators on the variability in audit quality. Then, we describe the SEC's proposed changes to BD reporting and the PCAOB's proposal for related attestation standards.

In addition, the fate of the Luzon Arc and Forearc in the collision is also not clear.

The results of our analysis indicate that the continental crust of the Eurasian margin forms a broad crustal root beneath central Taiwan, possibly with a thickness of 55 km.

Specifically, for a canonical linear‐time‐invariant network dynamics, we relate the Cramer–Rao bounds on eigenvalue estimator performance (from impulse‐response data) to structural properties of the transfer function and in turn, to the network's topological structure. We begin by reviewing and enhancing algebraic characterizations of such eigenvalue estimates, which are based on pole‐residue and pole‐zero representations of the network's dynamics. We use these results to characterize mode estimation in networks with slow‐coherency structures, finding that stimulus and observation in each strongly connected network subgraph is needed for high‐fidelity estimation. We also obtain spectral and graphical characterizations of estimator performance for other graph classes (e.g., trees) and for the general case. These characterizations are used to determine the role of measurement and actuation locations in estimation performance. Finally, application of our results in dynamical‐network security is illustrated through a simple example, and a concrete procedure for network mode estimation that draws on our structural results is introduced to conclude the article.

It negatively affects vine vigor, fruit yield, and grape quality (e.g., sugar accumulation) (3). Typical disease symptoms include downward rolling of grape leaves accompanied by interveinal reddening in red-fruited varieties and interveinal chlorosis in white-fruited varieties (2). The state of Texas currently has over 275 commercial vineyards and acreage under grape production is expanding. Currently, there is limited information on the presence of either GLRaV-2 (genus Closterovirus) or GLRaV-3 (genus Ampelovirus) in this state. During the 2012 season, 19 individual, symptomatic grapevines (13 cv. Lenoir and 6 cv. Blanc du Bois) were sampled (14 petioles per vine) from one vineyard site in Richards, TX. Total nucleic acid was extracted from the samples as described before (5) and tested by RT-PCR using species specific primers to amplify a 334-bp fragment of the HSP70h gene of GLRaV-2 (L2 F: 5′-ATAATTCGGCGTACATCCCCACTT-3′ and U2 R: 5′-GCCCTCCGCGCAACTAATGACAG-3′) (1) and a 541-bp fragment of the HSP70h gene of GLRaV-3 (LC1 F: 5′-CGCTAGGGCTGTGGAAGTATT-3′ and LC2 R: 5′-GTTGTCCCGGGTACCAGATAT-3′) (4). Samples were also subjected to triple (TAS) and double (DAS) antibody sandwich ELISA for GLRaV-2 and GLRaV-3 using commercially available antibody test kits (AC Diagnostics, Fayetteville, AR). Five samples tested positive for GLRaV-2 and one for GLRaV-3, all from the variety Lenoir with no incidences of mixed infection. In addition to the RT-PCR and ELISA, the presence of GLRaV-2 and GLRaV-3 was confirmed by direct sequencing of select RT-PCR products, which was purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen Inc., CA). The sequencing took place at the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA. GLRaV-2 isolate TX12 (GenBank Accession No. KF417612) and GLRaV-3 isolate TX9 (KJ545571) shared 85 to 100% and 94 to 100% nucleotide identity and 74 to 100% and 82 to 100% amino acid identity, respectively, with previously reported isolates from around the world. All samples tested negative for GLRaV-1, -4, -4 strain 5, and -4 strain 9 (4), suggesting that some of the symptomatic vines may have a different disease or abiotic disorder, such as a nutrient deficiency. To our knowledge, this is the first report of GLRaV-2 and GLRaV-3 in the state of Texas.","https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/abs/10.1094/PDIS-06-14-0619-PDN",""

This paper presents a method for comprehensive job, application and system‐level resource use measurement, and analysis and its implementation. The steps in the method are system‐wide collection of comprehensive resource use and performance statistics at the job and node levels in a uniform format across all resources, mapping and storage of the resultant job‐wise data to a relational database, which enables further implementation and transformation of the data to the formats required by specific statistical and analytical algorithms. Analyses can be carried out at different levels of granularity: job, user, application or system‐wide. Measurements are based on a new lightweight job‐centric measurement tool ‘TACC_Stats’, which gathers a comprehensive set of resource use metrics on all compute nodes and data logged by the system scheduler. The data mapping and analysis tools are an extension of the XDMoD project. The method is illustrated with analyses of resource use for the Texas Advanced Computing Center's Lonestar4, Ranger and Stampede supercomputers and the HPC cluster at the Center for Computational Research. The illustrations are focused on resource use at the system, job and application levels and reveal many interesting insights into system usage patterns and also anomalous behavior due to failure/misuse. The method can be applied to any system that runs the TACC_Stats measurement tool and a tool to extract job execution environment data from the system scheduler.

A sectional aerosol microphysics model (CARMA) is run online in GEOS‐5. CARMA treats the dust aerosol lifecycle, and its tracers are radiatively coupled to GEOS‐5. A series of AMIP‐style simulations are performed, in which input dust optical properties (particle shape and refractive index) are varied. Simulated dust distributions for summertime Saharan dust compare well to observations, with best results found when the most absorbing dust optical properties are assumed. Dust absorption leads to a strengthening of the summertime Hadley cell circulation, increased dust lofting to higher altitudes, and a strengthening of the African easterly jet, resulting in increased dust atmospheric lifetime and farther northward and westward transport. We find a positive feedback of dust radiative forcing on emissions, in contrast with previous studies, which we attribute to our having a relatively strong longwave forcing caused by our simulating larger effective particle sizes. This longwave forcing reduces the magnitude of midday net surface cooling relative to other studies, and leads to a nighttime warming that results in higher nighttime wind speeds and dust emissions. The radiative effects of dust particle shape have only minor impact on transport and emissions, with small (~5%) impact on top of atmosphere shortwave forcing, in line with previous studies, but relatively more pronounced effects on shortwave atmospheric heating and surface forcing (~20% increase in atmospheric forcing for spheroids). Shape effects on longwave heating terms are of order ~10%.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2F2013JD020046",""

Highly ramified processes of oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) make axonal contact and then extrapolate to wrap around axons and form multilayer compact myelin sheathes. Currently, the mechanisms governing myelin sheath assembly and axon selection by myelinating cells are not fully understood. Here, we generated a transgenic mouse line expressing the membrane‐anchored green fluorescent protein (mEGFP) in myelinating cells, which allow live imaging of details of myelinogenesis and cellular behaviors in the nervous systems. mEGFP expression is driven by the promoter of 2'‐3'‐cyclic nucleotide 3'‐phosphodiesterase (CNP) that is expressed in the myelinating cell lineage. Robust mEGFP signals appear in the membrane processes of oligodendrocytes in the CNS and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), wherein mEGFP expression defines the inner layers of myelin sheaths and Schmidt‐Lanterman incisures in adult sciatic nerves. In addition, mEGFP expression can be used to track the extent of remyelination after demyelinating injury in a toxin‐induced demyelination animal model. Taken together, the membrane‐anchored mEGFP expression in the new transgenic line would facilitate direct visualization of dynamic myelin membrane formation and assembly during development and process remodeling during remyelination after various demyelinating injuries. genesis 52:341–349, 2014. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fdvg.22751",""

As the understanding of cancer biology and the signaling pathways advances, it is now well understood that the detection of prostate cancer circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is an invaluable tool for monitoring the progression and finding possible therapies. Driven by this need, in this article, the development of magnetic‐nanoparticle‐attached theranostic graphene oxide (GO) is reported for targeted capture of prostate CTCs, accurate diagnosis, and combined therapeutic action of prostate cancer. Reported results show that anti‐epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) antibody and A9‐aptamer‐attached flower‐shaped magnetic nanoparticle‐bound 2D graphene can be used for selective capture and label‐free multicolor luminescence imaging of LNCaP prostate cancer cell from infected blood. Experimental data demonstrate that indocyanine green (ICG)‐bound A9‐aptamer‐attached theranostic GO is capable of external near IR 785 nm light‐driven combined synergistic photothermal and photodynamic treatment of prostate cancer. Possible mechanisms for targeted capture, accurate analysis, and combined therapeutic actions have been discussed. Experimental results show that the theranostic GO can have enormous potential for real‐life applications, once optimized properly in clinical settings.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fppsc.201400143",""

We explain that territorial conflicts are especially war-prone when democratic and autocratic states are engaged in conflict against one another. Because of domestic concerns, democracies and autocracies value territory differently, generating a smaller bargaining space. Democracies will tend to be more resistant to settlement when territory is of a “public,” symbolic, or intangible value. Autocracies, on the other hand, are more likely to value the tangible qualities of territory, such as its resource value. This disparity in territorial goals makes mixed regime dyads more war-prone when territory is disputed. We further believe that the smaller the winning coalition in autocracies, the more war-prone they are against democracies.

Because climate change is predicted to markedly alter current hydroclimatic conditions later this century, a better hydrological indicator of ecosystem performance is warranted to improve understanding of hydrological controls on vegetation and to predict changes in the future. Here we show that the observed total water storage anomaly (TWSA) from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) can serve as this indicator. Using the Australian mainland as a case study, where ecosystems are generally water limited, we found that GRACE‐observed TWSA can explain changes in surface greenness (as measured by the normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) both interannually and seasonally. In addition, we found that TWSA shows a significant decreasing trend during the millennium drought from 1997 through 2009 in the region. However, decline in annual mean NDVI during the same period was mainly driven by decline in annual minimum monthly NDVI, whereas annual maximum monthly NDVI remained relatively constant across biomes. This phenomenon reveals an intrinsic sensitivity of ecosystems to water availability that drought‐induced reductions in surface greenness are more likely expressed through its influence on vegetation during lower NDVI months, whereas ecosystem activities tend to recover to their maximum level during periods when the combined environmental conditions favor vegetation growth within a year despite the context of the prolonged drought.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2F2014JG002670",""

Such interactions occur abundantly within the cellular milieu and encompass interactions involved in vital cellular processes. Understanding the various types, mechanisms, and consequences of PPIs with respect to cellular signaling and function is vital for targeted drug therapy. Various types of small-molecule drugs and targeted approaches to drug design have been developed to modulate PPIs. Peptidomimetics offer an exciting class of therapeutics as they can be designed to target specific PPIs by mimicking key recognition motifs found at critical points in the interface of PPIs (e.g., hotspots). In contrast to peptides, peptidomimetics do not possess a natural peptide backbone structure but present essential functional groups in a required three-dimensional pattern complimentary to the protein-binding pocket. This design feature overcomes many limitations of peptide therapeutics including limited stability toward peptidases, poor transport across biologic membranes, and poor target specificity. Equally important is deciphering the structural requirements and amino acid residues critical to PPIs. This review provides an up-to-date perspective of the complexity of cellular signaling and strategies for targeting PPIs in disease states, particularly in cancer, using peptidomimetics, and highlights that the rational design of agents that target PPIs is not only feasible but is of the utmost clinical importance.

It is widely believed that dentin formation in crown and root uses the same regulatory mechanism. However, identification of nuclear factor 1 C (NFIC)'s unique function in determining root but not crown dentin formation challenges the old thinking. In searching for the target molecules downstream of NFIC, we unexpectedly found a sharp reduction of osterix (OSX), the key transcription factor in skeleton formation, in the Nfic knockout (Nfic-KO) tooth root. We then demonstrated a dose-dependent increase of Osx in the odontoblast cell line due to a transient transfection of Nfic expression plasmid. Studies of global and conditional Osx-KO mice revealed no apparent changes in the crown dentin tubules and dentin matrix. However, the OSX conditional KO (cKO) mice (crossed to the 2.3-kb collagen type 1 [Col1]-Cre) displayed an increase in cell proliferation but great decreases in expressions of root dentin matrix proteins (dentin matrix protein 1 [DMP1] and dentin sialophosphoprotein [DSPP]), leading to an inhibition in odontoblast differentiation, and short, thin root dentin with few dentin tubules. Compared to the Nfic-KO tooth, which contains essentially no dentin tubules and remains in a “root-less” status at adult stages, the Osx-cKO root phenotype had partially improved at the late stage, indicating that other factors can compensate for OSX function. Thus, we conclude that OSX, one of the key downstream molecules of NFIC, plays a critical role in root, but not crown, formation. © 2014 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.","https://academic.oup.com/jbmr/article-pdf/30/4/742/56568759/jbmr2391.pdf",""

Circadian rhythms optimize physiology and metabolism in plants and animals. In plant hybrids and polyploids, expression changes of the genes within the circadian regulatory network, such as CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1), lead to heterosis. However, the relationship between allelic CCA1 expression and heterosis has remained elusive. Here, we show a parent-of-origin effect on altered circadian rhythms and heterosis in Arabidopsis thaliana F1 hybrids. This parent-of-origin effect on biomass heterosis correlates with altered CCA1 expression amplitudes, which are associated with methylation levels of CHH (where H = A, T, or C) sites in the promoter region. The direction of rhythmic expression and hybrid vigor is reversed in reciprocal F1 crosses involving mutants that are defective in the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway (argonaute4 and nuclear RNA polymerase D1a) but not in the maintenance methylation pathway (methyltransferase1 and decrease in DNA methylation1). This parent-of-origin effect on circadian regulation and heterosis is established during early embryogenesis and maintained throughout growth and development.","http://academic.oup.com/plcell/article-pdf/26/6/2430/36976599/plcell_v26_6_2430.pdf",""

Modern agriculture mostly relies on chemically-driven modern varieties and irrigation to ensure high production, resulting in the deterioration and imbalance of the ecosystem. Consequently, outbreaks of diseases, insects and weeds have become more frequent in paddy fields. This paper describes the current situation of rice paddy biodiversity in China and analyzes the community characteristics of arthropods and weedy plants. Meanwhile, we discuss how biodiversity was affected by modern agriculture changes, which have brought about a mounting crisis threatening to animals and plants once common in rice paddies. Measures should be focused to firstly preventing further deterioration and, then, also, promoting restoration processes. Ecological sustainability can be achieved by restoring paddy field biodiversity through protecting the ecological environment surrounding the paddy fields, improving paddy cropping patterns, growing rice with less agricultural chemicals and chemical fertilizers, constructing paddy systems with animals and plants and promoting ecological education and public awareness.","https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/6/9/6107/pdf",""

Profiles of mother–adolescent coparenting were created with latent profile analysis using adolescents’ reports of three dimensions of coparenting (communication, involvement, and conflict). Four profiles were identified: (a) Harmonious Coparents (equal involvement, high communication, low conflict); (b) Harmonious‐Adolescent Primary (adolescent is more involved than mother, high communication, low conflict); (c) Conflictual Coparents (equal involvement, high communication, high conflict); and (d) Conflictual‐Adolescent Primary (adolescent is more involved than mother, moderate communication, high conflict). Families characterized by high mother–daughter conflict and psychological control prior to childbirth were more likely to belong in the Conflictual Coparents profile. In addition, adolescents’ and mothers’ depressive symptoms and parenting efficacy after childbirth were linked to profile membership, such that the Harmonious‐Adolescent Primary profile reported the most positive adjustment patterns, whereas profiles with high coparental conflict (i.e., Conflictual Coparenting and Conflictual‐Adolescent Primary profiles) showed the least positive adjustment patterns. Discussion considers the applied implications of identifying precursors to healthy and problematic mother–daughter coparenting for families of adolescent mothers in the early years of parenting.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Ffamp.12115",""

Specifically, we analyzed the role of HRAS mutations in erlotinib resistance. Methods: Erlotinib sensitivity was determined by methyl thiazolyl‐tetrazolium (MTT) assays. Molecular signaling pathways and somatic mutations were examined. Changes in sensitivity after modulation of HRAS expression were evaluated. Results: All 7 cell lines were wild‐type for EGFR and KRAS regardless of erlotinib sensitivity; however, 1 erlotinib‐resistant cell line (HN31) harbored an HRAS G12D mutation. Downregulation of HRAS expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in HN31 led to increased erlotinib sensitivity in vitro and in vivo. Transfection of activating HRAS‐mutant (G12D and G12V) constructs into erlotinib‐sensitive cell lines made them more resistant to erlotinib.

Theoretical study of lithium boding interactions thus is of paramount importance for a better understanding of the working mechanisms and designing high-efficient electrode–electrolyte interfaces from nanolevel for Li-based batteries. In this study, we used state-of-the-art theoretical methods, with inclusion of density functional theory/symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (DFT/SAPT), density functional reactivity theory (DFRT) and energy decomposition analysis (EDA), to delve into the nature of lithium bonding interactions. Our results showed that B3LYP outperforms all other functionals under consideration in the conventional supramolecular scheme, indicating that the formation of a lithium bond is not dispersion-driven. The calculated PBE0/SAPT and B3LYP/EDA data are consistent with each other, unravelling that the lithium bond is mainly of an electrostatically driven nature.

Objective:: To compare 2 groups of trained cyclists (DTT and DAL) who had similar physical characteristics and training programs (P &gt; .05). The DTT group (n = 12, age = 47 ± 7 years) drank only when thirsty, whereas the DAL group (n = 12, age = 44 ± 7 years) consumed fluid ad libitum (ie, whenever and in whatever volume desired). Design:: Cohort study. Setting:: Road cycling (164 km) in the heat (36.1°C ± 6.5°C). Patients or Other Participants:: Ultraendurance cyclists (4 women, 20 men). Intervention(s):: We recorded measurements 1 day before the event, on event day before the start, at 3 roadside aid stations, at the finish line, and 1 day after the event. Main Outcome Measure(s):: Body mass, urinary hydration indices, and food and fluids consumed. Results:: No between-groups differences were seen on event day for total exercise time (DTT = 6.69 ± 0.89 hours, DAL = 6.66 ± 0.77 hours), urinary indices (specific gravity, color), body mass change (DTT = −2.22% ± 1.73%, DAL = −2.29% ± 1.62%), fluid intake (DTT = 5.63 ± 2.59 L/6.7 h, DAL = 6.04 ± 2.37 L/6.7 h), dietary energy intake, macronutrient intake, ratings of thirst (DTT start = 2 ± 1, DTT finish = 6 ± 1, DAL start = 2 ± 1, DAL finish = 6 ± 1), pain, perceived exertion, or thermal sensation.

Conclusions:: Observations on event day indicated that drinking to thirst and drinking ad libitum resulted in similar physiologic and perceptual outcomes. This suggests that specific instructions to “drink to thirst” were unnecessary. Indeed, if athletes drink ad libitum, they can focus on training and competition rather than being distracted by ongoing evaluation of thirst sensations.","http://meridian.allenpress.com/jat/article-pdf/49/5/624/1456570/1062-6050-49_3_85.pdf",""

Accordingly, the most significant risk factor associated with COPD is exposure to cigarette smoke. The purpose of the present study is to provide an updated overview of the literature regarding the effect of CS on the immune system and lungs, the mechanism of CS-induced COPD and oxidative stress, as well as the available and potential treatment options for CS-induced COPD. An extensive literature search was conducted on the PubMed/Medline databases to review current COPD treatment research, available in the English language, dating from 1976 to 2014. Studies have investigated the mechanism by which CS elicits detrimental effects on the immune system and pulmonary function through the use of human and animal subjects. A strong relationship among continued tobacco use, oxidative stress, and exacerbation of COPD symptoms is frequently observed in COPD subjects. In addition, therapeutic approaches emphasizing smoking cessation have been developed, incorporating counseling and nicotine replacement therapy. However, the inability to reverse COPD progression establishes the need for improved preventative and therapeutic strategies, such as a combination of intensive smoking cessation treatment and pharmaceutical therapy, focusing on immune homeostasis and redox balance. CS initiates a complex interplay between oxidative stress and the immune response in COPD.

Extant studies are hampered by methodological limitations, such as small sample sizes, lack of control for confounding effects, and use of single sites and may lack representativeness. Hypothesis: The hypothesis for this study is that young offenders with a history of TBI will not only be at higher risk of impulsivity and negative emotionality than their non‐injured peers but also that those with TBI will have had more previous victimisation experiences. Methods: Data from two sites (Philadelphia, PA and Phoenix, AZ) in a substantial longitudinal, prospective study – the Pathways to Desistance Study – were used to compare young people (average age 16 years) who reported TBI with those who did not. Independent variables were behavioural, criminogenic and psychosocial measures. Results: Male youths were about twice as likely as young females to report TBI. Such injury was associated with higher impulsivity and negative emotion ratings, even after allowing for potentially confounding factors, including sex. In addition, TBI was independently associated with self‐reported experience of victimisation. Conclusions/implications: This extends the generalisability of earlier suggestions of a relationship between TBI and offending, and various factors thought likely to mediate the relationship. The implications are, thus, that it is likely to be of practical value to screen young people who get into the criminal justice system for a history of TBI, and thus to allow for more specific tailoring of interventions to reduce the range of associated problems, including likely reoffending.

In addressing the need of treatments for relapsed disease, we report the identification of an existing U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved small-molecule drug to repurpose for CLL treatment. Auranofin (Ridaura) is approved for use in treating rheumatoid arthritis, but it exhibited preclinical efficacy in CLL cells. By inhibiting thioredoxin reductase activity and increasing intracellular reactive oxygen species levels, auranofin induced a lethal endoplasmic reticulum stress response in cultured and primary CLL cells. In addition, auranofin displayed synergistic lethality with heme oxygenase-1 and glutamate-cysteine ligase inhibitors against CLL cells. Auranofin overcame apoptosis resistance mediated by protective stromal cells, and it also killed primary CLL cells with deletion of chromosome 11q or 17p. In TCL-1 transgenic mice, an in vivo model of CLL, auranofin treatment markedly reduced tumor cell burden and improved mouse survival.

Recent clinical trials reported an association between DRESS and telaprevir (TVR), an NS3/4A protease inhibitor of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) virus genotype 1. Its diagnosis is challenging given the variable pattern of cutaneous eruption and the myriad internal organ involvement. We present two patients who are middle-aged, obese, and white with CHC cirrhosis. They both developed a progressive diffuse, painful pruritic maculopapular rash at weeks 8 and 10 of CHC therapy with TVR, Peg-Interferon alfa-2a, and Ribavirin. They had no exposures to other medications that can cause this syndrome. Physical exam and labs and skin biopsy supported a “Definite” clinical diagnosis of DRESS, per RegiSCAR criteria. Thus Telaprevir-based triple therapy was discontinued and both patients experienced rapid resolution of the systemic symptoms with gradual improvement of eosinophilia and the skin eruption. These two cases illustrate the paramount importance of having a high index of suspicion for TVR-induced DRESS, critical for early diagnosis. Immediate discontinuation of TVR is essential in prevention of a potentially life-threatening complication.

HSat is defined as satisfaction with the e‐tailer spanning all transactions except the current encounter. Encounter satisfaction (ESat) is defined as the consumer's satisfaction with the current transaction. In the baseline model, four order fulfillment service quality (OFSQ) dimensions managerially relevant to consumer e‐tailing are examined: timeliness, availability, condition, and billing accuracy. The baseline structural model results support that OFSQ dimensions impact ESat, which in turn predicts two key consequences—repurchase intention and word‐of‐mouth. Adaptation theory is used to model the role of HSat, while controlling for transaction recency, vendor familiarity, and competitive pricing. HSat is shown to have pervasive main and interaction effects upon all baseline model relationships. These moderation effects have great managerial relevance. For example, the results illustrate a phenomenon similar to the service recovery paradox, wherein when a negative service encounter is followed by a highly positive service recovery event, previously dissatisfied consumers, as compared to previously satisfied consumers, respond with higher levels of current satisfaction. For managers, this finding is encouraging because policies that create highly positive events for consumers can thus supersede past negative experiences. Our results show however that HSat cannot be completely superseded by current OFSQ or current ESat.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fdeci.12056",""

Adaptive forecasting of 10‐day streamflow is still challenging, although persistence prediction models sometimes have good performance when streamflow has strong lag‐correlation. This study proposes a scheme of proving monthly and sub‐monthly flow forecasts at the beginning of the month and updating sub‐monthly forecasts subsequently. It examines a principal component regression method to provide monthly average streamflow and sub‐monthly, e.g. 10‐day, average streamflow forecasts, utilizing gridded precipitation forecasts from climate models and soil moisture estimates from hydrological models. Monthly streamflow forecasts are first obtained. It is then disaggregated to 10‐day streamflow based on historical observations using a nonparametric approach. The disaggregated 10‐day streamflow forecasts are further improved by incorporating streamflow and soil moisture estimates in the previous 10 days. Hence, sub‐monthly flow can be improved adaptively. The proposed approach is demonstrated for monthly and sub‐monthly streamflow forecasts in July at the Yangtze River, the largest river in China. The correlation between monthly streamflow forecasts and observation is 0.46 in leave‐one‐out cross‐validation mode. Updated sub‐monthly streamflow shows better skill than disaggregated sub‐monthly forecasts. To examine the impact of the accuracy of monthly streamflow forecasts on disaggregated 10‐day streamflow, synthetic streamflow time series of different level of forecasting skills were examined. Results show that the higher skill of synthetic monthly streamflow forecasts, the lower forecasts error. The value of soil moisture estimates in proving streamflow forecasts is also examined.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fjoc.3924",""

In particular, a variable importance measure based on extremely randomized trees ( Geurts et al., 2006 ) is proposed for correlated survival data, and is applied to the VA Dental Longitudinal Study. This new variable importance method aims to remove the bias of the traditional random forest variable selection, which may favour input variables with more categories, as shown by Strobl et al. ( 2007 ). The multivariate exponential tree algorithm of Fan et al. ( 2009 ) is used to build trees, as it has superior prediction accuracy and computational efficiency compared to marginal and semiparametric frailty model-based trees ( Nunn et al., 2011 ). Simulation studies for assessing various variable importance methods are presented. To limit the final number of meaningful prognostic groups, an amalgamation procedure is used to develop tooth prognostic groups from a forest of trees. The resulting prognosis rules and variable importance rankings may be used in clinical practice to increase tooth retention and establish rational treatment plans. By ranking the relative importance of various clinical and genetic factors for tooth loss, we are able to provide clinicians with critical information so that they can develop and implement an effective treatment plan.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1471082X14535517",""

However, existing works have explored use of NVM within dedicated I/O nodes, which are distant from the compute nodes that actually need such acceleration. As NVM bandwidth begins to out-pace point-to-point network capacity, we argue for the need to break from the archetype of completely separated storage. Therefore, in this work we investigate co-location of NVM and compute by varying I/O interfaces, file systems, types of NVM, and both current and future SSD architectures, uncovering numerous bottlenecks implicit in these various levels in the I/O stack. We present novel hardware and software solutions, including the new Unified File System (UFS), to enable fuller utilization of the new compute-local NVM storage. Our experimental evaluation, which employs a real-world Out-of-Core (OoC) HPC application, demonstrates throughput increases in excess of an order of magnitude over current approaches.","http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/sp/2014/303810.pdf",""

Plants have evolved two branches of the immune system to defend against pathogen infections. The primary innate immune response is triggered by the detection of evolutionarily conserved pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP), which is called PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). The second branch of plant innate immunity is triggered by the recognition of specific pathogen effector proteins and known as effector-triggered immunity (ETI). Calcium (Ca2+) signaling is essential in both plant PTI and ETI responses. Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) have emerged as important Ca2+ sensor proteins in transducing differential Ca2+ signatures, triggered by PAMPs or effectors and activating complex downstream responses. CDPKs directly transmit calcium signals by calcium binding to the elongation factor (EF)-hand domain at the C-terminus and substrate phosphorylation by the catalytic kinase domain at the N-terminus. Emerging evidence suggests that specific and overlapping CDPKs phosphorylate distinct substrates in PTI and ETI to regulate diverse plant immune responses, including production of reactive oxygen species, transcriptional reprogramming of immune genes, and the hypersensitive response.","https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/3/1/160/pdf",""

The significant anomaly in Hall coefficient at 5 GPa reveals an electronic topological transition deriving from the topological change of the band extremum (Van Hove singularity). Additionally, electrical resistivity measurements under variable temperatures show that the insulating state of Bi2Se3 becomes increasingly stable with an increase of pressure below 9.7 GPa.

Here, the method is used to test for annual and seasonal precipitation regimes during that same period. Water-year mean streamflow rankings at 125 U.S. Hydro-Climatic Data Network gauge stations are also evaluated during 1939–2011. The precipitation and streamflow regimes identified are compared with ORR-derived regimes in the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO), and indices derived from gridded SST anomaly (SSTA) analysis data. Using a graphic display approach that allows for the comparison of IMD climate regimes in multiple time series, an interdecadal cycle in western precipitation is apparent after 1980, as is a similar cycle in northwestern streamflow. Before 1980, IMD regimes in northwestern streamflow and annual precipitation are in approximate antiphase with the PDO. One of the clearest IMD climate signals found in this analysis are post-1970 wet regimes in eastern U.S streamflow and annual precipitation, as well as in fall [September–November (SON)] precipitation. Pearson correlations between time series of annual and seasonal precipitation averaged over the eastern United States and SSTA analysis data show relatively extensive positive correlations between warming tropical SSTA and increasing fall precipitation. The possible Pacific and northern Atlantic roots of the recent eastern U.S. wet regime, as well as the general characteristics of U.S. climate variability in recent decades that emerge from this analysis and that of Part I, are discussed.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jcli/article-pdf/27/24/9027/4040182/jcli-d-14-00041_1.pdf",""

The simplicity of the ORR procedure’s output—a time series’ most significant nonoverlapping periods of high or low rankings—makes it possible to graphically identify common temporal breakpoints and spatial patterns of IMD variability in the analyses of 102 climate division temperature series. This approach is also applied to annual Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) and Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) climate indices, a Northern Hemisphere annual temperature (NHT) series, and divisional annual and seasonal temperature data during 1896–2012. In addition, Pearson correlations are calculated between PDO, AMO, and NHT series and the divisional temperature series. Although PDO phase seems to be an important influence on spring temperatures in the northwestern United States, eastern temperature regimes in annual, winter, summer, and fall temperatures are more coincident with cool and warm phase AMO regimes. Annual AMO values also correlate significantly with summer temperatures along the Eastern Seaboard and fall temperatures in the U.S. Southwest. Given evidence of the abrupt onset of cold winter temperatures in the eastern United States during 1957/58, possible climate mechanisms associated with the cause and duration of the eastern U.S. warming hole period—identified here as a cool temperature regime occurring between the late 1950s and late 1980s—are discussed.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jcli/article-pdf/27/24/9006/4037412/jcli-d-14-00040_1.pdf",""

Frommhold, Collision-induced Absorption in Gases (Cambridge University Press, 1993 and 2006)]. The semiclassical method is based on repeated classical atom-atom scattering calculations to simulate an ensemble average; subsequent Fourier transform then renders the binary absorption coefficient as a function of frequency. The problem of classical calculations is the violation of the principle of detailed balance, which may be introduced only artificially in classical calculations. Nevertheless, it is shown that the use of classical trajectories permits a fairly accurate reproduction of the experimental spectra, comparable to the quantum mechanical results at not too low temperatures and for collisional pairs of not too small reduced mass. Inexpensive classical calculations may thus be promising to compute spectra also of molecular pairs, or even of polyatomic collisional pairs with anisotropic intermolecular interactions, for which the quantum approach is still inefficient or impractical.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.4870716/15476334/154302_1_online.pdf",""

Here, we have developed a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (MAb), designated Mersmab1, which potently blocks MERS-CoV entry into human cells. Biochemical assays reveal that Mersmab1 specifically binds to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the MERS-CoV spike protein and thereby competitively blocks the binding of the RBD to its cellular receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). Furthermore, alanine scanning of the RBD has identified several residues at the DPP4-binding surface that serve as neutralizing epitopes for Mersmab1. These results suggest that if humanized, Mersmab1 could potentially function as a therapeutic antibody for treating and preventing MERS-CoV infections. Additionally, Mersmab1 may facilitate studies of the conformation and antigenicity of MERS-CoV RBD and thus will guide rational design of MERS-CoV subunit vaccines.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.00433-14",""
