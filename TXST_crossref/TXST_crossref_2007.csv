PCR‐based molecular genetic techniques are very useful in studying microbial diversity since unculturable as well as culturable organisms can be investigated. One such technique is denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), which separates PCR‐amplified community 16S rRNA (and other gene) sequences on the basis of G+C content. Unlike other community fingerprinting techniques, bands from DGGE gels can be excised, and sequenced to identify community members. Thus DGGE can be used to describe overall microbial diversity as well as to identify individual community members. This protocol describes a method for using DGGE to study microbial diversity within biofilm populations.","http://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2F9780471729259.mc01e01s4",""

A clear problem is how such laws are limited to national jurisdictions. What is legal in one country may be illegal in another. Due to differences in cultures and values, and government types, it may not be possible to establish global standards and legislations to ensure privacy. Due to the nonexistence of global privacy standards, multinational (international) companies usually select one of the following two possible solutions: (1) implement a most restrictive “one size fits all” privacy policy that is used across various countries, or (2) implement different privacy policies that meet the privacy regulations of different countries and expectations of those citizens. In order to investigate a solution that may be used by multinational companies, and how companies view domestic privacy laws, the authors conducted a survey of U.S.-based employees of domestic and multinational companies. The results of the survey suggest that the majority of the multinational companies prefer the first solution—most restrictive “one size fits all” approach. They develop and implement a single set of privacy policies that is used across their operations in different countries. The majority of the companies surveyed consider domestic privacy laws in the United States to be practical, but ineffective.</p>","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=3649",""

Using existing spatial data, multiple measures of climate change vulnerability are analyzed along with demographic, attitudinal, and social contextual variables derived from a representative national survey to predict variation in risk perception. Bivariate correlation and multivariate regression analyses are used to identify and explain the most important indicators shaping individual risk perception.

Another example is in the comparison of gender and race across organizational units, controlling for confounders such as experience and qualification. Subsuming univariate categorical dependent variables as a special case, the model unifies existing organizational research methods, mitigates bias associated with univariate methods, provides more powerful testing methods, and provides a flexible modeling framework that allows hypotheses to be modeled and tested that are not possible with univariate models.

Bonding with an adhesive layer achieves near 100% yield and heterogeneous materials can be bonded by this method. Direct thermal bonding is a generic approach that is suitable for all thermoplastic polymers. It opens up the possibilities of creating 3D multilayer structures in functional polymers for advanced applications. The capability and flexibility of the techniques developed here are expected to have deep impact on the applications of soft materials such as polymers in micro- and nanofabricated devices and systems.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-pdf/25/6/2325/15642563/2325_1_online.pdf",""

For the first time, a population-balance model is fit to steady-state experimental data for both the three foam states (coarse foam, intermediate, and strong foam) and the two strong-foam regimes (low-quality and high-quality) observed in laboratory studies. Simulations confirm the stability of the coarse-foam and strong-foam states to small perturbations, and the instability of the intermediate state, at fixed injection rates. Introduction: Foam can improve sweep efficiency in gas-injection improved oil recovery (IOR) processes (Schramm 1994; Rossen 1996; Terdre 2003), redirect acid flow in matrix acid stimulation (Gdanski 1993; Cheng et al. 2002; Nguyen et al. 2003), and increase the efficiency of environmental remediation of aquifers (Hirasaki et al. 2000; Mamun et al. 2002). A continuing goal of foam research is the development of a fully mechanistic, predictive model. This paper describes efforts toward such a model and insights gained from application of the model to dynamic displacements. Before providing a detailed description of the model, it is worthwhile to review the mechanisms of foam in porous media and the experimental observations that the model attempts to reproduce.","http://onepetro.org/SJ/article-pdf/12/01/35/2125693/spe-90938-pa.pdf",""

Silicon dioxide (SiO2) and tantalum have been deposited as supporting layers before deposition of a thin layer of iron catalyst. Iron nanoparticles were formed after thermal annealing. It was found that densities, size distributions, and morphologies of iron nanoparticles were distinctly different on the two supporting layers. In particular, iron nanoparticles revealed a Volmer-Weber growth mode on SiO2 and a Stranski-Krastanov mode on tantalum. CCVD growth of CNTs was conducted on iron∕tantalum and iron∕SiO2. CNT growth on SiO2 exhibited a tip growth mode with a slow growth rate of less than 100nm∕min. In contrast, the growth on tantalum followed a base growth mode with a fast growth rate exceeding 1μm∕min. For comparison, plasma enhanced CVD was also employed for CNT growth on SiO2 and showed a base growth mode with a growth rate greater than 2μm∕min. The enhanced CNT growth rate on tantalum was attributed to the morphologies of iron nanoparticles in combination with the presence of an iron wetting layer.

Victim precipitation is generally defined as behavior by the victim that initiates the subsequent behavior of the victimizer; however, studies using this concept have often been accused of subtle and overt victim blaming. Distinguishing victim precipitation from victim blaming, this study explores the utility of victim precipitation in understanding contextual differences in men's and women's use of violence in intimate relationships and police use of dual arrest in IPV incidents.

Particular attention is paid to women arrested with their partner (i.e., dual arrestees) and the contextual characteristics of dual arrestee incidents.

The College Classroom Environment Scales (CCES) instrument, which includes six subscales related to student perceptions of the classroom climate, was administered to 41 interior design students in three studios at a large public research university. The results were compared to a theoretical model representing conventional classroom climates to determine if and how the interior design studio classroom climate varied. Additionally, this study measured the degree of variance in interior design student perceptions of the studio classroom climate relative to the student's level in the interior design program (junior, senior, fifth–year senior). Finally, this study considered the relationship between student perceptions of the studio classroom climate and their individual academic performance as reported by the instructors.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of tolerance width and subtended angle on aiming movement with multiple targets. Participants first hit a 5-cm-diameter circular target located 8 cm to the left of a starting position and then moved another 8 cm left to hit either a 5-cm diameter circular target or a 5- × 1-cm rectangular target oriented either horizontally or vertically, depending on the condition. Analysis showed that reaction times and movement times were longer for the vertical rectangular target, which had a smaller tolerance width than the other two targets. In addition, the vertical rectangular target also showed a greater percentage of secondary-submovement trials, lower movement velocity, and higher peak vertical displacement.

The ice thickness at the grounding line is greater than that of floating ice in hydrostatic equilibrium. Thus, the grounding line will tend to remain in the same location despite changes in sea level (until sea level rises enough to overcome the excess thickness that is due to the wedge). Further, our observation demonstrates the occurrence of rapid subglacial erosion, sediment transport by distributed subglacial till deformation, and grounding-line sedimentation, which have important implications for ice dynamics, numerical modeling of ice flow, and interpretation of the sedimentation record.","https://www.science.org/doi/pdf/10.1126/science.1138393",""

We examined predictions of the predation risk and the social factor hypotheses to explain intersexual grouping patterns and social behavior observed in white-tailed deer inhabiting the small city of San Marcos (population size ~45 000) in central Texas. Two routes were surveyed weekly from a vehicle at dawn and dusk for 1 year. Group size, composition, distance to vehicle, and alarm state of deer to the vehicle were recorded. Focal animal sampling was used to measure the time males and females spent and number of aggressions within one body length of each other when in groups. Female-only groups were most prevalent year round followed by mixed-sex groups, which increased in prevalence in summer and during the mating season. Alarm state was weakly related to group size but not to group composition. Males were farther apart and more aggressive than females in groups. Proportion of males in mixed-sex groups declined with increased group size. Intersexual patterns of grouping and social behavior of urban deer supported the social factor hypothesis but not the predation risk hypothesis.","http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/full-xml/10.1139/Z07-057",""

The results indicate that economic deprivation supercedes race in predicting the location of both landfill and Superfund sites; furthermore, both landfill and Superfund sites tend to be located in census tracts located near to industrial districts contiguous to navigable waterways in Detroit. Using Geographic Information Systems and logistic regression, the results indicate that the probability of living near a landfill is highest among the economically deprived and those least able to “escape” the urban center of Detroit. Substantively, the findings suggest that the process of deindustrialization is decisive in understanding environmental inequality, whereas methodologically, the results underscore the subtle nuances posed by different types of environmental threats.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1086026607300245",""

LDAR II source density contours were comma shaped, in association with severe wind events within mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) on 13 October 2001 and 27 May 2002. This signature is similar to the radar reflectivity bow echo. The source density comma shape was apparent 15 min prior to a severe wind report and lasted more than 20 min during the 13 October storm. Consistent relationships between severe straight-line winds, radar, and lightning storm cell characteristics (e.g., lightning heights) were not found for cells within MCSs as was the case for severe weather in supercells in Part I of this study. Cell interactions within MCSs are believed to weaken these relationships as reflectivity and lightning from nearby storms contaminate the cells of interest. Another hypothesis for these weak relations is that system, not individual cell, processes are responsible for severe straight-line winds at the surface. Analysis of the total lightning structure of the 13 October 2001 MCS showed downward-sloping source density contours behind the main convective line into the stratiform region. This further supports a charge advection mechanism in developing the stratiform charge structure. Bimodal vertical source density distributions were observed within MCS convection close to the center of the LDAR II network, while the lower mode was not detected at increasing range.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/mwr/article-pdf/135/10/3303/4226297/mwr3483_1.pdf",""

This drastic trend of decreasing source heights prior to and during tornado touchdown was observed in two storms, but did not occur in nontornadic supercells, suggesting that these parameters can be useful to forecasters. These observations agree with tornadogenesis theory that as the updraft weakens, the mesocyclone can divide (into an updraft and downdraft) and become tornadic.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/mwr/article-pdf/135/10/3281/4229120/mwr3472_1.pdf",""

Similarly, pretreatment of animals with IFN and experiments using mice defective in IFN signaling have indicated a role for IFN in controlling flavivirus disease in vivo. These data, along with findings that flavivirus-infected cells block IFN signaling, suggest that flavivirus infection can trigger an IFN response. To investigate IFN gene induction by the very first cells infected during in vivo infection with the flavivirus West Nile virus (WNV), we infected mice with high-titer preparations of WNV virus-like particles (VLPs), which initiate viral genome replication in cells but fail to spread. These studies demonstrated a brisk production of IFN in vivo, with peak levels of over 1,000 units/ml detected in sera between 8 and 24 h after inoculation by either the intraperitoneal or footpad route. The IFN response was dependent on genome replication, and WNV genomes and WNV antigen-positive cells were readily detected in the popliteal lymph nodes (pLN) of VLP-inoculated mice.

However, little has been written about the experiences of teachers of color working in suburban desegregated majority schools. Focus of Study: This article examines how intergroup differences created performance pressures for African American teachers and how this affected their ability to contribute optimally in these environments. Setting: The study took place in four predominantly European American districts that surround a large midwestern metropolitan area. When the desegregation program was implemented in these districts, it was court mandated; however, now the program operates on a volunteer basis whereby students can elect to participate and withdraw as necessary. The district accepted less than 25% of their minority students from a court-mandated desegregation program. Participants: A total of 7 male and 7 female African American teachers were interviewed. These male and female participants differed in grade-level positions. There were 4 female African American teachers at the elementary level, and 1 female and 3 male African American teachers at the middle school level. At the secondary level, there were 2 female and 4 male teachers who taught English, math, and history. There were some similarities between the male and female African American teachers. Research Design: For this study, a case study is defined as a single entity, a unit of similar groups of people within the bounded context of suburban desegregated schools surrounding a midsized midwestern city. Case studies are differentiated from other types of qualitative research in that they are intense descriptions and analysis of a single unit or bounded system. Data Collection and Analysis: In our sample of 14 participants, we had an equal representation of males and females (7 each). We were specifically interested in the perceptions and experiences of the African American teachers in their interactions with school administrators, parents, and students. A qualitative thematic strategy of data analysis was employed to categorize and make judgments about the interpretation of the data. This analytical procedure allowed important themes and categories to emerge inductively from the data across schools and districts. The researchers used the prior-research-driven approach to identify themes and to develop a coding process. In establishing the reliability for this study, the data were analyzed using what Glaser and Strauss called a constant comparative method. Conclusions and Recommendations: Our findings, based on the experiences of 14 self-reported accounts of African American teachers in these school environments, illuminated patterns of experiences for teachers of color. Regarding the first subtheme, automatic notice, teachers developed strategies that assisted them in their transitions to inhospitable environments in the suburban schools. The female teachers reported the need for a strong reference-group orientation that would enable them to retain their cultural identity within the school. Whereas the female teachers viewed automatic notice negatively, the male participants recognized their high visibility as way to compete with their peers. Dealing with symbolic consequences, the second emergent subtheme, underrepresented individuals often bear the burden of dispelling myths and representing their race in their exchanges with coworkers. The African American teachers also became resistant to representing their race. In many ways, these teachers expressed the notion that their European American colleagues expected them to take ownership for issues that affected only the African American children. These teachers were compromised by this narrow definition of their expertise and disliked their limited role as the “minority representative.” In fighting discrepant stereotypes, the third subtheme, the underrepresented African American teachers had to defend their status to have their accomplishments recognized. The teachers reported that their individuality was often overshadowed by their colleagues’ stereotypical beliefs about African Americans. The male teachers constantly had to refute negative male African American stereotypes, and the women had to deal with proving their worth as “qualified” teachers. The final pressure, what we call cultural switching, became apparent as the African American female teachers expressed the heaviness of being in an environment where they were often one of few people of color, or the only person of color, in the school. The female teachers struggled with the cultural incongruity that occurred between them and their European American peers. In many ways, these performance pressures resulted in the feeling constrained and unable to use social cues to navigate their school's culture. Recommendations from this study may provide insights on how suburban desegregated schools may improve workplace relationships to recruit and retain teachers of color in these contexts.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/016146810710900503",""

Furthermore, insufficient scapular upward rotation has been empirically linked with several of these shoulder disorders. However, the difference in scapular upward rotation between pitchers and position players is not known. Hypothesis: Pitchers will have decreased scapular upward rotation of their dominant shoulders compared with position players. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: Dominant shoulder scapular upward rotation was measured with the arm at rest and at 60°, 90°, and 120° of humeral elevation among 15 professional baseball pitchers and 15 position players with no recent history of upper extremity injury. Results: Independent t tests showed pitchers have significantly less scapular upward rotation at 60° (3.9°, P = .011) and 90° (4.4°, P = .009) of humeral elevation compared with position players. Conclusion: Baseball pitchers have less scapular upward rotation than do position players, specifically at humeral elevation angles of 60° and 90°. Clinical Relevance: This decrease in scapular upward rotation may compromise the integrity of the glenohumeral joint and place pitchers at an increased risk of developing shoulder injuries compared with position players. As such, pitchers may benefit from periscapular stretching and strengthening exercises to assist with increasing scapular upward rotation.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0363546507305098",""

We show here that trichome initiation is triggered within 4 h of the induction of the GLABRA3 (GL3) basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor. Within this developmental window, GL3 binds to the promoters of at least three genes previously implicated in the development and patterning of trichomes (GL2, CAPRICE, and ENHANCER OF TRIPTYCHON AND CAPRICE1) and activates their transcription. The in vivo binding of GL3 to the promoters of these genes requires the presence of the R2R3-MYB factor GL1, supporting a model in which a GL3-GL1 complex is part of the trichome initiation enhanceosome. In contrast, GL3 is recruited to its own promoter in a GL1-independent manner, and this results in decreased GL3 expression, suggesting the presence of a GL3 negative autoregulatory loop. In support of genetic analyses indicating that ENHANCER OF GL3 (EGL3) is partially redundant with GL3, we show that EGL3 shares some direct targets with GL3. However, our results suggest that GL3 and EGL3 work independently of each other. Taken together, our results provide a regulatory framework to understand early events of epidermal cell differentiation.","http://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-pdf/145/3/736/37069175/plphys_v145_3_736.pdf",""

Further, we propose that this learning will vary across the dual-technology frontier (DTF), where the high-technology frontier (HTF) and low-technology frontier (LTF) map onto innovative activities driven by technological opportunity and user needs. We propose that at the HTF, local search will dominate and firms will be influenced by HTF product introductions of similarly sized, successful firms. At the LTF, learning will occur across the DTF, vary by origin industry of the firm, and be affected by complementarities in routines and capabilities and market competition among firms. We test the proposed model of vicarious learning using panel data on new product introductions of 67 firms in the U.S. digital camera market in the 1990s. Findings generally support our proposed model of vicarious learning in this market. They show heterogeneity in vicarious learning across the technology frontier and firm characteristics—including the origin industry of target firms. Our results show that vicarious learning in new product introductions in converging markets—which includes both mimetic and nonmimetic learning—is similar in some ways, but different from more traditional markets.

We confirm our hypotheses using a population of 1,237 family-owned olive oil mills in Southern Spain who faced the choice during a 54-year period of becoming a member of a cooperative, a decision associated with loss of family control but lower business risk, or remaining independent, which preserves the family's socioemotional wealth but greatly increases its performance hazard.

Chem. Phys. 111, 3800 (1999)] a Hessian-based integration algorithm was derived for performing direct dynamics simulations. In the work presented here, improvements to this algorithm are described. The algorithm has a predictor step based on a local second-order Taylor expansion of the potential in Cartesian coordinates, within a trust radius, and a fifth-order correction to this predicted trajectory. The current algorithm determines the predicted trajectory in Cartesian coordinates, instead of the instantaneous normal mode coordinates used previously, to ensure angular momentum conservation. For the previous algorithm the corrected step was evaluated in rotated Cartesian coordinates. Since the local potential expanded in Cartesian coordinates is not invariant to rotation, the constants of motion are not necessarily conserved during the corrector step. An approximate correction to this shortcoming was made by projecting translation and rotation out of the rotated coordinates. For the current algorithm unrotated Cartesian coordinates are used for the corrected step to assure the constants of motion are conserved. An algorithm is proposed for updating the trust radius to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the numerical integration.

VPg-pUpU is templated by an RNA stem-loop (the cre or oriI) found at different locations in picornavirus genomes. At least one adaptive mutation is required for human rhinovirus type 14 (HRV-14) to use poliovirus type 3 (PV-3) or PV-1 oriI efficiently. One mutation changes Leu-94 of 3C to Pro; the other changes Asp-406 of 3Dpol to Asn. By using an in vitro VPg uridylylation system for HRV-14 that recapitulates biological phenotypes, we show that the 3C adaptive mutation functions at the level of 3C(D) and the 3D adaptive mutation functions at the level of 3Dpol. Pro-94 3C(D) has an expanded specificity and enhanced stability relative to wild-type 3C(D) that leads to production of more processive uridylylation complexes. PV-1/HRV-14 oriI chimeras reveal sequence specificity in 3C(D) recognition of oriI that resides in the upper stem. Asn-406 3Dpol is as active as wild-type 3Dpol in RNA-primed reactions but exhibits greater VPg uridylylation activity due to more efficient recruitment to and retention in the VPg uridylylation complex. Asn-406 3Dpol from PV-1 exhibits identical behavior. These studies suggest a two-step binding mechanism in the assembly of the 3C(D)-oriI complex that leads to unwinding of at least the upper stem of oriI and provide additional support for a direct interaction between the back of the thumb of 3Dpol and 3C that is required for 3Dpol recruitment to and retention in the uridylylation complex.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.00972-07",""

The plant samples were of a smaller size than typical herbarium accessions due to limitations in personnel, storage space, available plant materials, and time. The vouchers were identified in the field if possible. The vast majority of the rest were identified in the herbarium morphologically after the survey; less than 5% of the vouchers remained unidentified. Of these, a subset were subjected to molecular analysis using sequences of the nuclear ribosomal ITS region and to a BLAST search of sequences in GenBank to find closely related taxa. The close relatives along with the unknown specimens were subjected to maximum parsimony analysis to identify the potential phylogenetic relationships of the unknown specimens. Through this analysis nine unknown plant accessions were identified to family, tribe, genus, and species. Once this level of identification was established, some specimens were reexamined morphologically and compared with potentially related taxa in the herbarium to confirm or improve identifications. We outline an efficient method for surveying and collecting plant vouchers for a large sampling area.

This solver seeks a local solution from a subset of these points, holding discrete variables fixed. The procedure is motivated by our desire to combine the superior accuracy and feasibility-seeking behavior of gradient-based local NLP solvers with the global optimization abilities of OptQuest. Computational results include 155 smooth NLP and mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP) problems due to Floudas et al.

Despite this recognition, researchers have not explored how the outer form in which a technological innovation is embodied influences the processes through which the innovation’s value is constructed and perceived. In this paper we argue that by embodying novel technologies in objects with specific functional, symbolic, and aesthetic properties, innovating firms also endow their products with cues that trigger a variety of cognitive and emotional responses. Drawing on psychological research we articulate how such cognitive and emotional responses underlie initial perceptions of value and theorize how innovating firms can influence them through product form design. Our framework explains how product form contributes to perceptions of value by modulating the actual technological novelty of a product innovation and facilitating how customers cope with it. Our theoretical framework makes an important contribution to innovation research and practice because it articulates how product form can be used strategically to achieve specific cognitive and emotional effects and enhance the initial customer perceptions of the value of an innovation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/orsc.1060.0233",""

Three adult speakers each produced 360 tokens (six V1 contexts×ten V2 contexts×three stops×two emphasis conditions). Realizing that anticipatory coarticulation of V2 onto the intervocalic C can be influenced by prosodic effects, as well as by vowel context effects, a modified locus equation regression metric was used to isolate the effect of phrasal accent on consonantal F2 onsets, independently of prosodically induced vowel expansion effects. The analyses revealed two main emphasis-dependent effects: systematic differences in F2 onset values and the expected expansion of vowel space. By accounting for the confounding variable of stress-induced vowel space expansion, a small but consistent coarticulatory effect of emphatic stress on the consonant was uncovered in lingually produced stops, but absent in labial stops. Formant calculations based on tube models indicated similarly increased F2 onsets when stressed /d/ and /g/ were simulated with deeper occlusions resulting from more forceful closure movements during phrasal accented speech.","https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article-pdf/121/6/3802/14713587/3802_1_online.pdf",""

The telemedicine project was an unsuccessful effort to develop a videoconferencing network to serve rural nursing homes. The relationship between researchers and the vendor went through four phases: (1) pre-grant work; (2) the Request for Proposal process and vendor selection; (3) pre-installation planning; and (4) installation and troubleshooting. Throughout the project an information asymmetry caused problems, compounded by a lack of governance mechanisms to ensure vendor performance.

Current microarray data analysis approaches assume that the quantified signal intensities are linearly related to the expression of the corresponding genes in the sample. However, there are sources of nonlinearity in microarray expression measurements. Such nonlinearity study in the expressions of the RNA mixtures provides a new way to analyze gene expression data, and we argue that the nonlinearity can reveal novel information for microarray data analysis. Therefore, we proposed a statistical model, called proportion model, which is based on the linear regression analysis. To approximately quantify the nonlinearity in the dilution design, a new calibration, beta ratio (BR) was derived from the proportion model. Furthermore, a new adjusted fold change (adj-FC) was proposed to predict the true FC without nonlinearity, in particular for large FC.","https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-pdf/23/11/1339/49813218/bioinformatics_23_11_1339.pdf",""

Using SI, we theorize that early puberty creates unusually high levels of distress for adolescents (more so for girls than boys), causing them to behave in ways that create grievances with others and provoke victimization. The research hypotheses were tested using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), a nationally representative data set of teenagers attending school in the United States. We found that measures of distress significantly increase violent victimization among members of the sample. Furthermore, the SI measures partially mediated the relationship between early puberty and violent victimization for boys and fully mediated this relationship for girls.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0022427807305851",""

Isonitrogen samples with and without ions were studied using various plasma operating conditions. Optical emission spectrometry was used to characterize relative proportions of different active nitrogen plasma species (atomic N and metastable N2*). Samples grown without ions and with a higher proportion of atomic N resulted in the best overall material quality, although this improvement was observed at high annealing temperatures. At lower annealing temperatures, increased blueshifts were observed for samples grown with a higher proportion of atomic N; however, there was no noticeable influence of ions on blueshift regardless of whether atomic N or metastable N2* was the dominant species present in the plasma. The key implication of this work is that it helps to elucidate a possible reason for some of the contradictory reports in the literature.

We present one consequence of this insensitivity to confinement: a simple analytical equation relating the average density of the confined fluid to that of the bulk fluid with equal activity. Nontrivial implications of confinement for average fluid properties do emerge in this system, but only when the fluid is both (i) dense and (ii) confined to a gap smaller than approximately three particle diameters. For this limited set of conditions, we find that “in-phase” oscillatory deviations in excess entropy and self-diffusivity (relative to the behavior of the bulk fluid at the same average density) occur as a function of gap size. These paired thermodynamic/kinetic deviations from bulk behavior appear to reflect the geometric packing frustration that arises when the confined space cannot naturally accommodate an integer number of particle layers.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.2748045/15399877/244708_1_online.pdf",""

Comparisons are made between simulated and observed near surface mean variables, radiation, turbulence fluxes, mixed layer heights and morning inversion strengths, low‐level jets, and land‐sea breeze circulations. The comparisons indicate that for the Gulf Coast environment and typical summertime conditions, the Eta PBL scheme clearly outperforms the MRF PBL scheme in nearly all aspects. The results reveal that the popular Dudhia radiation scheme tends to overpredict the downward longwave radiation, which consequently results in a warm bias at night and a weaker nocturnal low level jet.

The task of FFIP is to estimate potential faults and their propagation paths under critical event scenarios. The framework is based on combining hierarchical system models of functionality and configuration, with behavioral simulation and qualitative reasoning. The main advantage of the method is that it allows the analysis of functional failures and fault propagation at a highly abstract system concept level before any potentially high-cost design commitments are made. As a result, it provides the designers and system engineers with a means of designing out functional failures where possible and designing in the capability to detect and mitigate failures early on in the design process.

Open source software (OSS) is a major technology base for enterprise application development. The complexity of technologies used by industry is often an obstacle to their use in the classroom. In this chapter, a major software development paradigm change that occurred in about the year 2000 is explained. CS education programs have been slow to adapt to the paradigm change due to problems such as the tenure system, inexperienced student laboratory assistants, lack of leading-edge software tool support, lack of software team project servers, unavailability of help and mentoring services, and software unavailability. This chapter explains how these problems can be solved by creating an open source-based shared software infrastructure program (SSIP) sponsored by industry, but planned and implemented by SSIP member universities at no cost to member universities.","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=21225",""

We also examine maternal characteristics associated with awareness and the willingness to undergo these procedures. While 89% were aware that such tests are available, younger, black and less educated women were less likely to know about prenatal tests for birth defects. Seventy‐two percent of respondents said they would want their baby tested while Hispanic and black women were significantly more likely to express an interest than non‐Hispanic whites. This study demonstrates the variability of knowledge and beliefs and confirms the importance of taking time to understand an individual's personal beliefs, knowledge and attitudes about prenatal diagnosis.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1007/s10897-007-9103-6",""

The classical continuum mechanics fails to address this problem since no material length scale exists in its constitutive description. On the other hand, nonlocal continuum theories of integral-type or gradient-type have been to a good extent successful in predicting this type of size effect. However, they fail to predict size effects when strain gradients are minimal such as the Hall-Petch effect. This problem is the main focus of this work. The effect of the material microstructural interfaces increase as the surface-to-volume ratio increases. It is shown in this work that interfacial effects have a profound impact on the scale-dependent plasticity encountered in micro/nano-systems. This is achieved by developing a higher-order gradient-dependent plasticity theory that enforces microscopic boundary conditions at interfaces and free surfaces. These nonstandard boundary conditions relate the microtraction stress at the interface to the interfacial energy. Application of the proposed framework to size effects in shear loading of a thin-film on an elastic substrate is presented. Three film-interface conditions are modeled: soft, intermediate, and hard interfaces.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2007-42020/2673062/1023_1.pdf",""

To address this question, we examined how three new firms - Amazon.com, barnesandnoble.com and CDNow - that entered the emerging e-commerce domain in the mid-1990s built their initial reputations in the media. Given the limited theory and empirical evidence about the process of reputation accumulation by new firms in emerging markets, we used the case study method to develop inductively a model that relates the visible external actions of the three firms to the patterns of media coverage they accumulated. Patterns of media coverage are likely to both reflect and affect the process of reputation accumulation, as the media constitute an influential audience of critics, who first form their own perceptions and opinions, thereby reflecting the process of reputation accumulation, and then disseminate these perceptions and opinions to the public, thereby influencing the perceptions and opinions of other stakeholder audiences. Our analysis indicates that the pattern of market actions of new firms influences the pattern of media coverage they receive in terms of levels (visibility), content (strategic character), tenor (favorability) and distinction (esteem).The observed inter-firm differences in these characteristics of received coverage suggest that reputation may be better understood as a composite construct and that firms' reputational assets may vary in their composition. Our study offers an inductively developed process model that relates the market actions of new firms to the accumulation of the different components of their initial reputations in the media.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1476127006074389",""

In the past, the majority of such auctions have been solely price based, but increasingly attributes other than price affect the auction outcome. Specifically, the buyer uses a scoring function to compare bids and the bid with the highest score wins. We investigate two mechanisms commonly used for procurement in business-to-business markets, in a setting in which buyers' welfare is affected by exogenous nonprice attributes such as the quality, service, and past relationships. Under both mechanisms, bidders bid based on price, but in the “buyer-determined” mechanism, the buyer is free to select the bid that maximizes her surplus while in the “price-based” mechanism, the buyer commits to awarding the contract to the low price bidder. We find, both in theory and in the laboratory, that the “buyer-determined” mechanism increases the buyer's welfare only as long as enough suppliers compete. If the number of suppliers is small and the correlation between cost and quality is low, the buyer is better off with the “price-based” mechanism. These findings are intended to help procurement managers make better decisions in designing procurement mechanisms for a variety of settings.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mksc.1070.0281",""

Design.: Cross-sectional study using population-level data. Setting.: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Subjects.: 2132 infants admitted to the NICU. Measures.: Breastfeeding at hospital discharge was measured with the question, “Is the infant being breastfed?” Delivery hospitals were dichotomized as to the presence or absence of an IBCLC on staff. Analysis.: Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between breastfeeding at discharge and the presence of an IBCLC at the delivery facility while adjusting for maternal characteristics and birth outcomes. Results.: Among mothers of infants admitted to the NICU, breastfeeding rates among mothers who delivered at hospitals with an IBCLC were nearly 50% compared with 36.9% among mothers who delivered at hospitals without an IBCLC. The adjusted odds of breastfeeding initiation prior to hospital discharge were 1.34 (95% confidence interval = 1.03, 1.76) times higher for women who delivered at a facility with an IBCLC.

Consequently, it lowers the performance of the cloud and precipitation retrieval algorithms that utilize the model database. Since multi‐frequency satellite observations contain information on hydrometeors' properties, measured brightness temperatures can give guidance as to how the modeled cloud database may be modified to better mimic natural clouds. Following this philosophy, in this study, we propose a method to adapt the modeled database toward observations. The newly constructed database results in a better match to the characteristics of the satellite observed brightness temperatures.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2006GL027857",""

Given this motivation, firms are unbundling their value chain processes and exploring new sourcing mechanisms. With the emergence of world-class skills and capabilities in offshore locations, new sourcing mechanisms have become available beyond traditional domestic insourcing and outsourcing. However, there is little systematic research examining how firms choose sourcing mechanisms for their business processes. This study views the digitally enabled extended enterprise as a complex system of business processes and examines how sourcing choices are made in such enterprises. It builds on the modular systems theory to posit that modularization of business processes and their underlying information technology (IT) support infrastructures are associated with the choice of sourcing mechanisms for the processes. The study tests this proposition in a sample of business process sourcing choices made by 93 medium and large U.S. firms. The results show that firms tend to choose domestic outsourcing for processes that are high in modularity and offshore outsourcing for processes that are low in modularity. Further, when processes can be detached from a firm's IT infrastructure, firms tend to use offshore outsourcing. However, when processes are tightly coupled with underlying IT infrastructure, it may be infeasible to detach processes and execute them in remote locations. Implications for theory and practice are also discussed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/isre.1070.0129",""

Using a sample of preadolescent youth, this research examines the effect of family and peer relationships on delinquency. Specifically, path analysis is used to test the effects of family structure, parental supervision, and parental attachment on serious delinquent behavior to determine if a youth's family life has a unique effect on serious delinquent behavior, or if familial relationships are mediated by peer associations. Findings suggest that parental variables are indirectly related to subsequent, serious delinquency, whereas delinquent peer association exerts a strong, direct effect. The study offers insight into the roles that a youth's family life and peer associations play in explaining delinquent behavior.

This method combines information from multiple fidelity sources including computer simulation models of the product, first principals involved in design, and designer’s qualitative intuitions about the design. Both quantitative and qualitative information from different sources are merged together to arrive at a new sampling strategy. This is accomplished by introducing the concept of a confidence function, C, which is represented as a field that is a function of the decision variables, x, and the performance parameter, f. We compare the sampling plans generated by Q2S2 to previously known sample plans on five test functions using various metrics. In each case, the performance of Q2S2 is highly encouraging.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/DETC2007-34520/2680380/649_1.pdf",""

We selectively review the literature on gender in politics, focusing on women's formal political participation. We discuss both traditional explanations for women's political participation and representation, such as the supply of women and the demand for women, and newer explanations such as the role of international actors and gender quotas. We also ask whether women are distinctive—does having more women in office make a difference to public policy? Throughout the review we demonstrate that a full understanding of women's political representation requires both deep knowledge of individual cases such as the United States and broad knowledge comparing women's participation across countries. We end with four recommended directions for future research: (a) globalizing theory and research, (b) expanding data collection, (c) remembering alternative forms of women's agency, and (d) addressing intersectionality.","https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.soc.33.040406.131651",""

Because Notch-1, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) are critically involved in the processes of tumor cell invasion and metastasis, we investigated whether PDGF-D down-regulation could be mechanistically associated with the down-regulation of Notch-1, NF-κB, VEGF, and MMP-9, resulting in the inhibition of tumor cell invasion and angiogenesis. Our data showed that down-regulation of PDGF-D leads to the inactivation of Notch-1 and NF-κB DNA-binding activity and, in turn, down regulates the expression of its target genes, such as VEGF and MMP-9. We also found that the down-regulation of PDGF-D by small interfering RNA (siRNA) decreased tumor cell invasion, whereas PDGF-D overexpression by cDNA transfection led to increased cell invasion. Consistent with these results, we also found that the down-regulation of PDGF-D not only decreased MMP-9 mRNA and its protein expression but also inhibited the processing of pro-MMP-9 protein to its active form. Moreover, conditioned medium from PDGF-D siRNA–transfected cells showed reduced levels of VEGF and, in turn, inhibited the tube formation of human umbilical vascular endothelial cells, suggesting that down-regulation of PDGF-D leads to the inhibition of angiogenesis. Taken together, we conclude that the down-regulation of PDGF-D by novel approaches could lead to the down-regulation of Notch-1 and, in turn, inactivate NF-κB and its target genes (i.e., MMP-9 and VEGF), resulting in the inhibition of invasion and angiogenesis.

The authors argue that the effect of economic punishment is conditional on a state's political institutions. In all cases, the key to sanctions success is to generate political costs for the target regime's winning coalition. However, because of different institutional incentives, economically punishing sanctions are less likely to succeed against a nondemocratic target than against a democratic target. Sanctions increase rents. This benefits nondemocratic leaders more than democratic ones. Also, nondemocratic leaders have smaller winning coalitions, so their core constituents suffer less from sanctions than democratic leaders. Additionally, the authors' strategic argument leads to novel hypotheses regarding the initiation of sanctions. They test hypotheses from their political cost argument against all dyadic sanctions cases between 1948 and 1990, using two different dependent variables and a censored selection estimator to take into account the strategic nature of sanctioning.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0022002707306811",""

An improved framework is proposed to support the discussion and evaluation of subjective cultural factors in a deeper, more systematic fashion. The cognitive theory of Howard Gardner, multiple intelligences theory, is explored as one potential framework for exploring cross-cultural digital library usability. Each component of Gardner's theory is introduced, placed in a cultural context, and then briefly reviewed in terms of its potential application to digital libraries. Alternative frameworks, particularly the cultural dimensions theory of Geert Hofstede, are also introduced. Multiple intelligences theory is found to be helpful for understanding the nature of cultural variables, but not readily translatable into operational design principles for digital libraries. Combining multiple intelligences cognitive theory with cultural theory and global HCI design principles may prove a useful direction for future research.","https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/LIBR.2007.17/xml",""

In this paper, we calculate detailed age-specific infant mortality rates by maternal race/ethnicity and nativity for two important reasons: (1) it is extremely unlikely that women of Mexican origin would migrate to Mexico with newborn babies, especially if the infants were only a few hours or a few days old; and (2) more than 50% of all infant deaths in the United States occur during the first week of life, when the chances of out-migration are very small. We use concatenated data from the U.S. linked birth and infant death cohort files from 1995 to 2000, which provides us with over 20 million births and more than 150,000 infant deaths to analyze. Our results clearly show that first-hour, first-day, and first-week mortality rates among infants born in the United States to Mexican immigrant women are about 10% lower than those experienced by infants of non-Hispanic, white U.S.-born women. It is extremely unlikely that such favorable rates are artificially caused by the out-migration of Mexican-origin women and infants, as we demonstrate with a simulation exercise. Further, infants born to U.S.-born Mexican American women exhibit rates of mortality that are statistically equal to those of non-Hispanic white women during the first weeks of life and fare considerably better than infants born to non-Hispanic black women, with whom they share similar socioeconomic profiles. These patterns are all consistent with the definition of the epidemiologic paradox as originally proposed by Markides and Coreil (1986).","http://read.dukeupress.edu/demography/article-pdf/44/3/441/909232/441hummer.pdf",""

Differing cloud types (both precipitating and nonprecipitating) play an important role in determining the total diabatic heating profile. Variations in the vertical structure of the apparent heat source, Q1, can be related to the diurnal cycle, large-scale forcings such as atmospheric waves, and rain thresholds at each location. For example, TRMM-LBA, which occurred in the Brazilian Amazon, had mostly deep convection during the day while KWAJEX, which occurred in the western portion of the Pacific intertropical convergence zone, had more shallow and moderately deep daytime convection. Therefore, the afternoon height of maximum heating was more bottom heavy (i.e., heating below 600 hPa) during KWAJEX compared to TRMM-LBA. More organized convective systems with extensive stratiform rain areas and upper-level cloud decks tended to occur in the early and late morning hours during TRMM-LBA and KWAJEX, respectively, thereby causing Q1 profiles to be top heavy (i.e., maxima from 600 to 400 hPa) at those times. SCSMEX, which occurred in the South China Sea during the monsoon season, had top-heavy daytime and nighttime heating profiles suggesting that mesoscale convective systems occurred throughout the diurnal cycle, although more precipitation and upper-level cloud in the afternoon caused the daytime heating maximum to be larger. A tendency toward bottom- and top-heavy heating profile variations is also associated with the different cloud types that occurred before and after the passage of easterly wave troughs during KWAJEX, the easterly and westerly regimes during TRMM-LBA, and the monsoon onset and postonset active periods during SCSMEX. Rain thresholds based on heavy, moderate, and light/no-rain amounts can further differentiate top-heavy heating, bottom-heavy heating, and tropospheric cooling. These budget studies suggest that model calculations and satellite retrievals of Q1 must account for a large number of factors in order to accurately determine the vertical structure of diabatic heating associated with tropical cloud systems.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jas/article-pdf/64/7/2593/3620297/jas3938_1.pdf",""

We report the results of two experiments on vocal pitch imitation that addressed these possibilities. Participants listened to and then vocally imitated unfamiliar 4-note pitch sequences.Within each experiment, 10-15% of the participants imitated pitch at least one semitone off and were categorized as ""poor-pitch singers."" Such deviations were reliable across different pitch classes and therefore constitute transpositions. In addition, poor-pitch singers compressed the size of intervals during production. Poor-pitch singers did not differ from good singers in pitch discrimination accuracy, although they appeared to be hindered rather than helped by singing with correct accompaniment. Taken together, findings suggested that poor-pitch singing results from mismapping of pitch onto action, rather than problems specific to perceptual,motor, or memory systems.","https://online.ucpress.edu/mp/article-pdf/25/2/95/564181/mp_2007_25_2_95.pdf",""

Moreover, CMVF is not only constrained to visual properties, but can also incorporate human classification criteria to further strengthen image retrieval process. The controlled study present in this paper concentrates on CMVF's performance on images, examining how the incorporation of extra features into the indexing affects both efficiency and effectiveness. Analysis and empirical evidence suggest that the inclusion of extra visual features can significantly improve system performance. Furthermore, it demonstrated that CMVF's effectiveness is robust against various kinds of common image distortions and initial (random) configuration of neural network.","https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S0219467807002751",""

We validate this model empirically using cross‐sectional survey data from U.S. manufacturing plants. We find that some IT applications are more effective at enabling the outsourcing of business processes than others. For example, the implementation of enterprise management systems is associated with the outsourcing of both production and support processes, whereas operations management systems are not associated with the outsourcing of plant processes. Plants with a low‐cost outsourcing strategy are more likely to outsource support processes than plants with a competency‐focused outsourcing strategy. However, both cost‐ and competency‐based strategies have a positive and similar impact on the outsourcing of production processes. In terms of implications for plant performance, our findings indicate that the outsourcing of production and support processes is associated with higher gross margins. Although plant IT infrastructure is positively associated with favorable on‐time delivery rates, there is no positive association between the incidence of plant outsourcing and on‐time delivery rates. These results have implications for crafting plant‐level outsourcing strategies and for investments in IT systems to facilitate the outsourcing of business processes for enhanced plant performance.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2007.tb00293.x",""

This gives rise to a non-physical description of the penetration and perforation processes. A micromechanical constitutive model that couples the anisotropic thermo-viscodamage mechanism with the thermo-hypoelasto-viscoplastic deformation will be presented as a remedy to this situation. Explicit and implicit microstructural length scale measures, which preserve the well-posed nature of the differential equations, are introduced through the use of the viscosity and gradient localization limiters. Simple and robust numerical algorithms for the integration of the constitutive equations will be also presented. The proposed unified integration algorithms are extensions of the classical rate-independent return mapping algorithms to the rate-dependent problems. A simple and direct computational algorithm is also used for implementing the gradient-dependent equations. This algorithm can be implemented in the existing finite element codes without numerous modifications as compared to the current numerical approaches for integrating gradient-dependent models. Model capabilities are preliminarily illustrated for the dynamic localization of inelastic flow in adiabatic shear bands and the perforation of Weldox 460E steel plates with various thicknesses by a deformable blunt projectile at various high impact speeds.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2007-42074/2672990/549_1.pdf",""

However, there are many challenges involved in accurately characterizing the motion of blood within the arterial system. First, computational models can require finite element meshes with several million degrees of freedom. Furthermore, surgical planning applications require solving these problems as quickly as possible. Second, the boundary conditions must faithfully represent the flow and pressure characteristics of the vascular trees external to the computational model. These conditions must also be consistent with the intrinsic wave propagation phenomena within the model. Third, the fluid-solid interactions between blood, vessel wall and surrounding tissues and organs need to be modeled. In order to represent the pulsation of blood within arteries, one must consider the variations in arterial compliance (especially significant when dealing with large models), points of attachment of the vessels to the surrounding organs, etc. Prior vascular fluid-structure interaction models have considered uniform vessel wall properties and a zero pressure reference state.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/SBC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/SBC2007-176686/4208288/427_1.pdf",""

Overexpression of this receptor is one means by which a cell can achieve positive signals for survival and proliferation; another effective means is by constitutive activation of EGFR. We have elucidated the role of constitutive EGFR signaling in malignant progression by stably transfecting colon cancer cells with a human transforming growth factor-α cDNA (a ligand for EGFR) under repressible control by tetracycline. We show that constitutive expression of transforming growth factor-α and its subsequent constitutive activation of EGFR allows for cancer cell survival in response to environmental stress in vitro and in vivo as well. The reversal of constitutive EGFR activation results in the loss of downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt activation, and a reduction in xenograft size that is associated with decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis. We used CI-1033, a small molecule antagonist of EGFR, to dissect an activation pathway that shows the ability of ERBb2 to activate Akt, but not Erk in the face of EGFR antagonism. This novel escape mechanism is a possible explanation of why anti-EGFR therapies have shown disappointing results in clinical trials.

In our capacity game model, a monopolistic supplier has to build capacity before observing the uncertain demand. The demand is generated by two potential customers, who privately know their own types. The types could be either high or low, differing in willingness to pay for each unit of demand. To discriminate between the customer types, the supplier designs option contracts so that only the high type will buy options in advance. The high type will do so because the options can hedge their risk of demand loss when capacity is tight. The supplier profits in three ways. First, the high type customers pay higher marginal prices on average. Second, the high type customers' demand is satisfied as a first priority, guaranteeing allocation efficiency. Third, the supplier can observe the number of options being purchased and so determine customer types, improving capacity investment efficiency. We compare our results to those of classical second degree price discrimination. We show that our proposed framework guarantees the same level of supplier profit even when the supplier cannot discriminate between the customers by bundling products.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2007.tb00170.x",""

Development of new therapies has been hampered by the lack of valid animal models. We have developed a novel murine model of MCL-BV by crossing interleukin 14α (IL-14α) transgenic mice with c-Myc transgenic mice (double transgenic [DTG]). IL-14α is a B-cell growth factor that is expressed in a number of high-grade lymphomas, including MCL-BV. Ninety-five percent of IL-14α transgenic mice develop CD5+ large B-cell lymphomas by 18 months of age. Sixty percent of c-Myc transgenic mice develop pre-B-cell lymphomas by 12 months of age. Close to 100% of DTG mice develop an aggressive, rapidly fatal lymphoma at 3 to 4 months of age that is CD5+, CD19+, CD21−, CD23−, sIgM+. The tumor is found in the blood, bone marrow, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract, and lungs and rarely in the brain, similar to the involvement seen in human MCL-BV. Immunoglobulin gene rearrangements document the monoclonality of the tumor. Cyclin D1 is highly expressed in these tumors, as it is in MCL-BV. DTG represents a novel model for MCL-BV that should reveal important insights into the pathogenesis of the lymphoma and contribute to the development of new forms of therapy.","http://ashpublications.org/blood/article-pdf/109/11/4899/1478131/zh801107004899.pdf",""

However, patients who develop resistance to TKI treatment often acquire a somatic resistance mutation (T790M) located in the catalytic cleft of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) enzyme. Recently, a report describing EGFR-T790M as a germ-line mutation suggested that this mutation may be associated with inherited susceptibility to lung cancer. Contrary to previous reports, our analysis indicates that the T790M mutation confers increased Y992 and Y1068 phosphorylation levels. In a human bronchial epithelial cell line, overexpression of EGFR-T790M displayed a growth advantage over wild-type (WT) EGFR. We also screened 237 lung cancer family probands, in addition to 45 bronchoalveolar tumors, and found that none of them contained the EGFR-T790M mutation. Our observations show that EGFR-T790M provides a proliferative advantage with respect to WT EGFR and suggest that the enhanced kinase activity of this mutant is the basis for rare cases of inherited susceptibility to lung cancer.

ZEP-520A (Nippon Zeon) resist, a nonchemically amplified positive electron beam resist was employed for this effort due to its dry-etch resistance and high-resolution characteristics. The development of the ZEP-520A resist in ZED-N50 developer (Nippon Zeon) has been characterized and optimized for both low and room temperature developer conditions. In addition, standard reactive ion etch technologies have been utilized in conjunction with the low temperature developed ZEP-520A patterns to produce 10nm range gratings in polysilicon substrates with aspect ratios of 10:1. These gratings are intended for evaluation by angle-dependent and wavelength-dependent optical scatterometry methods for critical dimension measurements. The authors report on the preliminary etch optimization as well as advanced inductively coupled plasma etch characteristics of the pattern transfer.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-pdf/25/1/102/13548371/102_1_online.pdf",""

In an open‐label study using LNAA, a surprising decline of blood Phe concentration was found in patients with PKU in metabolic treatment centres in Russia, the Ukraine, and the United States. To validate the data obtained from this trial, a short‐term double‐blind placebo control study was done using LNAA in patients with PKU, with the participation of three additional metabolic centres – Milan, Padua and Rio de Janeiro. The results of the short trial showed significant lowering of blood Phe concentration by an average of 39% from baseline. The data from the double‐blind placebo control are encouraging, establishing proof of principle of the role of orally administered LNAA in lowering blood Phe concentrations in patients with PKU. Long‐term studies will be needed to validate the acceptability, efficacy and safety of such treatment.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1007/s10545-007-0556-4",""

Image interpolation techniques are referred in literature by many terminologies, such as image resizing, image resampling, digital zooming, image magnification or enhancement, etc. Basically, an image interpolation algorithm is used to convert an image from one resolution (dimension) to another resolution without loosing the visual content in the picture. Image interpolation algorithms can be grouped in two categories, non-adaptive and adaptive. The computational logic of an adaptive image interpolation technique is mostly dependent upon the intrinsic image features and contents of the input image whereas computational logic of a non-adaptive image interpolation technique is fixed irrespective of the input image features. In this paper, we review the progress of both non-adaptive and adaptive image interpolation techniques. We also proposed a new algorithm for image interpolation in discrete wavelet transform domain and shown its efficacy. We describe the underlying computational foundations of all these algorithms and their implementation techniques. We present some experimental results to show the impact of these algorithms in terms of image quality metrics and computational requirements for implementation.","https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1317488&ftid=705496&dwn=1",""

In natural populations, both sexes may encounter affected as well as unaffected individuals during the breeding season, and any diminution in attractiveness could compromise reproductive success. Here we examine mate preference in male and female rats whose progenitors had been treated with the antiandrogenic fungicide vinclozolin. This effect is sex-specific, and we demonstrate that females three generations removed from the exposure discriminate and prefer males who do not have a history of exposure, whereas similarly epigenetically imprinted males do not exhibit such a preference. The observations suggest that the consequences of EDCs are not just transgenerational but can be “transpopulational”, because in many mammalian species, males are the dispersing sex. This result indicates that epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of EDC action represents an unappreciated force in sexual selection. Our observations provide direct experimental evidence for a role of epigenetics as a determinant factor in evolution.","https://pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.0610410104",""

Geologic mapping of the thrust belt depicts a duplex with three horses that incorporate Eocene limestones and Oligocene to early Miocene clastics inboard of the subducting Cocos Ridge axis. By constructing a cross section at this location along a NE–SW trending transect perpendicular to the thrust belt, we constrain a shortening rate of approximately 40 mm/a and propose that as much as 50% of the total plate convergence rate is taken up in the inner forearc. The Eocene limestones at the base of the thrust sheets pinch out in both directions away from the onland projection of the Cocos Ridge axis owing to decrease in slip on faults and a lateral ramp in the basal décollement. The thrust belt terminates near the Panama border at the onland projection of the subducting Panama Fracture Zone. These observations suggest that shortening is propagating to the east with the migration of the Panama triple junction and the onset of shallow subduction of the thickened edge of the Cocos plate. The absence of similar features in the Nicaraguan forearc, where the subducting crust is older, subducts more steeply, and lacks incoming ridges and seamounts, indicates that deformation of the forearc basin in Costa Rica reflects greater coupling between the converging plates inboard of the Cocos Ridge.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2006TC001949",""

LOH was observed in 65% of the 26 lung tumors examined and was narrowed down to a 2.2-Mb region. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of genes located within this region identified a candidate gene, termed p34. This gene, also designated as ZC3H12D, C6orf95, FLJ46041, or dJ281H8.1, carries an A/G nonsynonymous SNP at codon 106, which alters the amino acid from lysine to arginine. Nearly 73% of heterozygous lung cancer tissues with LOH and the A/G SNP also exhibited loss of the A allele. In vitro clonogenic and in vivo nude mouse studies showed that overexpression of the A allele exerts tumor suppressor function compared with the G allele. p34 is located within a recently mapped human lung cancer susceptibility locus, and association of the p34 A/G SNP was tested among these families. No significant association between the less frequent G allele and lung cancer susceptibility was found. Our results suggest that p34 may be a novel tumor suppressor gene involved in sporadic lung cancer but it seems not to be the candidate familial lung cancer susceptibility gene linked to chromosomal region 6q23-25.

To determine if A. marginale infection induced suppression or peripheral deletion of antigen-specific T cells, MHC class II tetramers were used to enumerate epitope-specific T cells following immunization of calves with a DNA construct encoding the 30-mer F2-5 epitope of MSP1a and infection six months later. As observed for MSP2, the MSP1a F2-5 peptide-specific CD4 T cell responses, still strong at the time of challenge, rapidly disappeared by 2–4 weeks. BoLA MHC class II DRB3 *1101 tetramers were constructed with the 15-mer core F2-5 epitope, designated F2-5B, linked to the DRB3 chain. Tetramer-stained PBMC obtained following immunization and challenge were selected with anti-PE beads prior to FACS analysis to increase the sensitivity of detection. The loss of MSP1a peptide F2-5-specific T cell responses was paralleled by a rapid decline in circulating DRB3 *1101-F2-5B tetramer-positive CD4 T cells after challenge, showing that the lack of response is not simply due to anergy or suppression. Our data support the hypothesis that the antigen-specific cells undergo activation-induced cell death in response to the infection, as tetramer-positive cells were not detected in spleen or liver.","https://journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article/178/1_Supplement/LB5/82184/Tetramer-staining-of-Anaplasma-marginale-specific",""

Compilation of QTL mapping results yields a more complete picture of the genetic control of a trait and reveals patterns in organization of trait variation. A total of 432 QTL mapped in one diploid and 10 tetraploid interspecific cotton populations were aligned using a reference map and depicted in a CMap resource. Early demonstrations that genes from the non-fiber-producing diploid ancestor contribute to tetraploid lint fiber genetics gain further support from multiple populations and environments and advanced-generation studies detecting QTL of small phenotypic effect. Both tetraploid subgenomes contribute QTL at largely non-homeologous locations, suggesting divergent selection acting on many corresponding genes before and/or after polyploid formation. QTL correspondence across studies was only modest, suggesting that additional QTL for the target traits remain to be discovered. Crosses between closely-related genotypes differing by single-gene mutants yield profoundly different QTL landscapes, suggesting that fiber variation involves a complex network of interacting genes. Members of the lint fiber development network appear clustered, with cluster members showing heterogeneous phenotypic effects. Meta-analysis linked to synteny-based and expression-based information provides clues about specific genes and families involved in QTL networks.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/176/4/2577/46756454/genetics2577.pdf",""

Chem. Phys. 125, 094102 (2006)]. In that article the main message is that the Renner-Teller phenomenon, just like the Jahn-Teller phenomenon, is a topological effect. Now we extend this study to a tetra-atomic system, namely, the C2H2+ ion, for which topological effects are revealed when one atom surrounds the triatom axis or when two atoms surround (at a time) the two-atom axis. The present study not only supports the findings of the previous study, in particular, the crucial role played by the topological D matrix for diabatization, but it also reveals new features which are expected to be more and more pronounced the larger the original collinear molecule. As already implied, shifting away two atoms from the collinear molecular axis does not necessarily abolish the ability of the remaining two atoms to form topological effects. Moreover, the study indicates that when the two hydrogens are shifted away, the CC axis produces two kinds of topological effects: (1) a Renner-Teller effect (characterized by a topological phase of 2π) which is revealed when the two hydrogens surround, rigidly, this axis (as mentioned above), and (2) a Jahn-Teller effect (characterized by a topological phase of π) which is revealed when one of the hydrogens surrounds this axis while the other hydrogen is clamped to its position.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.2717934/14861333/154309_1_online.pdf",""

One kind of impact is that their structures may affect how their knowledge is organized. This is important because the different ways in which knowledge can be organized may affect what the organizations' decision makers learn from the information that their organizations have gathered, stored, and processed. However, rigorous testing of this general argument would not be easy, and so it would be useful if a preliminary means of assessment could be found so that we can better judge whether a full-scale test is warranted. Hammond (1993) noted that a library catalogue is also a formal structure for hierarchically organizing knowledge, which means that different kinds of cataloguing systems represent different ways of organizing knowledge. Two different kinds of cataloguing systems — the Library of Congress classification and the Dewey Decimal classification — are widely used in US libraries, and Hammond conjectured that these two different cataloguing systems will tend to bring different sets of books to the attention of library users; this in turn should be expected to have consequences for what the library users can most easily learn from the library. This article tests Hammond's conjecture in two university libraries, focusing on 40 classic books in political science. The results provide strong empirical support for the conjecture: although the two cataloguing systems do not appear to organize knowledge in completely different ways, what differences they do have nonetheless appear to have a striking impact on what users can most easily learn. Support is thus provided, albeit indirectly, for the general argument that how organizations are structured hierarchically should be expected to affect what organizational decision makers are able to learn.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0951629807080776",""

Pedons were described and sampled for characterization at two pre‐mined sites and four post‐mined sites near Mandeville, Jamaica.

Pre‐mined soils consisted of Ap and Bo horizons making up clayey Oxisols with low charge and low bulk density.

Post‐mined soils consisted of ^Ap horizons (replaced topsoil) and 2^C horizons (fill material) over limestone. Some post‐mined pedons also had 2Bob or 3Bob horizons (Bo in situ buried by replaced topsoil and/or fill material). Post‐mined soils had higher bulk density in the ^Ap horizons than pre‐mined Ap horizons and higher pH throughout due to the incorporation of limestone rock fragments.

Results suggest that reducing the total time of a patient's visit to a health care facility will improve not only patient satisfaction with how long the entire visit takes, but also satisfaction with other aspects of the visit not including waiting.

Curriculum requirements are framed by the Commission on Dental Accreditation, which has stipulated competencies and associated biomedical and clinical knowledge that must be addressed during dental school. Although these competency requirements restrict the variance of educational experiences, students are eager to share their views on the curriculum within the realm of their educational experience. The objective of this research project was to elicit the perspectives of dental students from a broad cross‐section of U.S. and Canadian dental schools about their education. A total of 605 students (285 sophomores, 220 seniors, 100 residents) from twenty North American dental schools completed a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis to communicate their perceptions of the curriculum. Students were also asked to provide their impressions of the overall quality of the educational program in an open‐ended written format. The students’ qualitative comments were then reviewed and categorized into key issues or themes. Resulting themes for each category of the Curriculum SWOT (C‐SWOT) analysis were the following. Strengths: 1) clinical learning experience, and 2) opportunity to work with knowledgeable faculty. Weaknesses: 1) disorganized and inefficient clinical learning environment, 2) teaching and testing that focus on memorization, 3) poor quality instruction characterized by curricular disorganization, and 4) inconsistency among instructors during student evaluations. Opportunities: 1) develop strategies to provide students with more exposure to patients, especially early in the curriculum, and 2) opportunities to learn new technology/techniques. Threats: 1) cost of dental education, 2) students’ concerns about faculty “brain drain,” i.e., lack of sufficient numbers of dental faculty capable of providing high‐quality instruction, and 3) questionable treatment of patients in the dental clinic as a consequence of pursuing procedural requirements. This report presents commentaries selected from 2,421 total responses that communicate students’ perspectives related to C‐SWOT themes. Students at seven schools in this study reported that they completed all or portions of the first two years of the curriculum in combined classes with medical students. Sophomore and senior students at these schools provided their thoughts on this curricular approach; these perceptions are also reported. Findings from this study are compared to results from a similar investigation of dental student perceptions conducted fifty years ago. We conclude that students participating in this study were positive overall about their learning experiences in dental schools, but identified several areas that appear to be problematic for many students at a variety of different schools including fundamental concerns about instructional quality in some areas of the curriculum. Academic program administrators in dental schools can use these findings to guide modifications that will enhance the overall dental education experience.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fj.0022-0337.2007.71.5.tb04320.x",""

To investigate this possibility, participants threw underhanded to specific metric distances during Pre and Post-Testing, e.g., throwing an object so that it came to rest 30 feet away. During the intervening Training, participants generated verbal distance estimates. Half received metric feedback. The results indicated that throws improved from Pre to Post-Test, but only when participants received metric feedback during Training. This outcome supports our hypothesis. Moreover, it suggests that trainees must know whether their distance estimation training should be applied to untrained tasks. Doing so may benefit certain tasks.

The aerosol gas dynamics of the jet flow field, nanoparticle acceleration in the jet, and deposition by impaction onto the substrate were modeled for both a flat-plate nozzle and for a conical nozzle designed to obtain higher impaction velocities. We modeled nanoparticle dynamics for He, Ar, and N2 gasses, all initially at room temperature and 1 atm pressure, flowing through a 250 μm orifice into vacuum with a pressure ratio of ~5000. Experiments were conducted to deposit silver nanoparticle aerosols under the same conditions as were modeled. The silver nanoparticles were generated by laser ablation of a flowing microparticle aerosol entrained in either He or Ar that produced nanoparticles 5−10 and 15−20 nm in diameter, respectively. Deposition was made onto an unheated substrate in vacuum. The morphology of the deposited films was determined by scanning electron microscope cross-section images and crystallite size was determined by x-ray diffraction analysis. The morphological features and crystallite size were correlated with the nanoparticle impaction velocity and impaction energy derived from the model. We found that, for a given gas type, the size of the grains and morphological features within the impacted films were similar to the size of the nanoparticles from which the films were formed. The density and the degree of consolidation of the films were highly dependent on the nanoparticle impaction velocity/energy and were highest for helium.

Immigrant status of adolescents and their maternal caregivers uniquely predicted increased Mexican cultural orientation and decreased Anglo cultural orientation, and both Mexican and Anglo cultural orientation related positively to adolescents’ endorsement of traditional cultural values. Endorsement of traditional cultural values related, in turn, to decreased externalizing behaviors and increased academic engagement and these findings were replicated across adolescent and teacher report of these two outcomes. Tests of mediation provided further evidence to support these pathways. Findings support the central importance of traditional cultural values as a protective resource that explains why immigrant youth exhibit fewer externalizing problems and increased academic engagement when compared to their second and third generation peers.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1007/s10464-007-9152-x",""

Exercise activation of AMPK is unaffected in lean (BMI ∼25 kg/m2) subjects with type 2 diabetes. However, most type 2 diabetic subjects are obese (BMI &gt;30 kg/m2), and exercise stimulation of AMPK is blunted in obese rodents. We examined whether obese type 2 diabetic subjects have impaired exercise stimulation of AMPK, at different signaling levels, spanning from the upstream kinase, LKB1, to the putative AMPK targets, AS160 and peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor coactivator (PGC)-1α, involved in glucose transport regulation and mitochondrial biogenesis, respectively. Twelve type 2 diabetic, eight obese, and eight lean subjects exercised on a cycle ergometer for 40 min. Muscle biopsies were done before, during, and after exercise. Subjects underwent this protocol on two occasions, at low (50% Vo2max) and moderate (70% Vo2max) intensities, with a 4–6 week interval. Exercise had no effect on LKB1 activity. Exercise had a time- and intensity-dependent effect to increase AMPK activity and AS160 phosphorylation. Obese and type 2 diabetic subjects had attenuated exercise-stimulated AMPK activity and AS160 phosphorylation. Type 2 diabetic subjects had reduced basal PGC-1 gene expression but normal exercise-induced increases in PGC-1 expression. Our findings suggest that obese type 2 diabetic subjects may need to exercise at higher intensity to stimulate the AMPK-AS160 axis to the same level as lean subjects.","https://journals.org/diabetes/diabetes/article-pdf/56/3/836/663507/zdb00307000836.pdf",""

With the advent of limb-sparing techniques, primary forequarter amputation is performed less frequently, but remains a powerful surgical option in managing malignant tumours of the upper extremity; therefore, surgeons should be familiar with this procedure. A classic case report of forequarter amputation, with emphasis on indications and surgical techniques, is presented.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/229255030701500204",""

Patients and Methods: Sixty-six patients with aggressive skin SCC were randomly assigned to receive either 6 months of combined 13cRA (1 mg/kg/d orally) and IFN-α (3 × 10 Results: At 21.5 months median follow-up, treatment did not improve the time to tumor recurrence and SPT versus control (hazard ratio [HR], 1.13; 95% CI, 0.53 to 2.41), time to tumor recurrence (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.43 to 2.72), or time to SPT (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.27 to 2.93). Adjuvant 13cRA and IFN-α was moderately tolerable; 29% of patients in the treatment arm required dose reductions for grade 3 or 4 toxicities. Conclusion: Results of this phase III trial do not support 13cRA plus IFN-α for adjuvant therapy of aggressive skin SCC. With high rates of tumor recurrence and SPTs, patients with aggressive skin SCC continue to have an unmet medical need, with devastating mortality, morbidity, and financial consequences. Promising agents with preclinical and early clinical results relevant to aggressive skin SCC deserve a high priority for future clinical drug development.","https://ascopubs.org/doi/pdfdirect/10.1200/JCO.2006.05.9873",""

As Rita approached the Gulf Coast, uncertainties in the storm’s track and intensity forecasts, combined with the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, led to major evacuations along the Texas coast and significant traffic jams in the broader Houston area. This study investigates the societal impacts of Hurricane Rita and its forecasts through a face-to-face survey with 120 Texas Gulf Coast residents. The survey explored respondents’ evacuation decisions prior to Hurricane Rita, their perceptions of hurricane risk, and their use of and opinions on Hurricane Rita forecasts. The vast majority of respondents evacuated from Hurricane Rita, and more than half stated that Hurricane Katrina affected their evacuation decision. Although some respondents said that their primary reason for evacuating was local officials’ evacuation order, many reported using information about the hurricane to evaluate the risk it posed to them and their families. Despite the major traffic jams and the minor damage in many evacuated regions, most evacuees interviewed do not regret their decision to evacuate. The majority of respondents stated that they intend to evacuate for a future category 3 hurricane, but the majority would stay for a category 2 hurricane. Most respondents obtained forecasts from multiple sources and reported checking forecasts frequently. Despite the forecast uncertainties, the respondents had high confidence in and satisfaction with the forecasts of Rita provided by the National Hurricane Center.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/waf/article-pdf/22/6/1177/4641436/2007waf2006118_1.pdf",""

Our method is based on using approximate Dirichlet boundary conditions and polynomial approximations of the boundary. The sequence of GFEM-spaces consists of nonzero boundary value functions, and hence it does not conform to one of the basic Finite Element Method (FEM) conditions. We obtain quasi-optimal rates of convergence for the sequence of GFEM approximations of the exact solution. We also extend our results to the inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary value problem, including the case when the boundary data has low regularity (i.e. is a distribution). Finally, we indicate an effective technique for constructing sequences of GFEM-spaces satisfying our assumptions by using polynomial approximations of the boundary.","https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S0218202507002571",""

The A1(LO) band is interpreted by an asymmetric two-phonon decay.

Factors associated with distant metastasis and mortality were assessed by univariate analysis. Independent predictors of mortality and distant metastasis were assessed by multivariate analysis. Fifty-five patients with stage II CRC were identified (96% men, age 65 ± 1.2 years old). Univariate analysis demonstrated that patients with distant metastasis (n = 13) had a history of alcohol intake (54% vs 20%; P = 0.029), less history of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use for the management of hypertension (31% vs 67%; P = 0.029), greater incidence of a rectal location for cancer (54% vs 12%; P = 0.004), an abdominoperineal resection (APR) for surgical management of their cancers (23% vs 0%; P = 0.011), and less negative lymph nodes examined during surgical resection (9 ± 2.2 vs 15 ± 1.2, P = 0.022).

Transmission electron microscopy images show that the Sn nanodots have an average size of about 3nm, and both single-crystal and amorphous nanodots have been observed at room temperature. The nanodots are randomly distributed in the lateral direction but confined in a narrow layer in the depth direction. The bimodal size distribution that is often observed in high energy implantation was not observed in the present study. The spatial morphology and crystallinity of the Sn nanodots can be modified by thermal annealing, and the extent of the modification is dependent on the annealing temperature. The distribution and crystallinity of the Sn nanodots in single-crystal bulk SiO2 are different from those of Sn nanocrystals in thin SiO2 films on silicon substrates. The mechanisms that could account for these phenomena are discussed.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-pdf/25/3/796/8213917/796_1_online.pdf",""

The efficiency of these methods was assessed by new methylene blue staining and manual enumeration of the reticulocytes. FACS sorted erythrocytes from reticulocytes based on size and granularity, as well as the absence of dsDNA staining. MACS depleted reticulocytes from erythrocytes based on the immunoaffinity to CD36 and CD71. Reticulocytes from healthy controls were depleted to ≤0.1% using either the FACS or MACS method (α = 0.1). Reticulocytes from SCD subjects were depleted from 13.6% ± 0.52% to 5.45% ± 0.33% using MACS (n = 2), and from 10.9% ± 0.47% to 2.0% ± 0.2% using FACS (n = 4, α = 0.05). When combining FACS with MACS (n=3), the percentage of reticulocytes was decreased in SCD samples from 13.0% ± 0.51% down to 1.5% ± 0.17% (α = 0.1). Sedimentation through 75% percoll resulted in control and SCD samples being reduced from 0.27% ± 0.6 (control) and 6.93% ± 0.8 (SCD) reticulocytes to < 4.8 reticulocytes per million control RBCs and <2.5 per million SCD RBCs.

A mobile robot navigates through the sensor deployment area broadcasting its positional estimate and the uncertainty in its estimate. Distributed computationally-inexpensive, discrete-time Kalman Filters, implemented on each static sensor node, fuse information obtained over time from the robot to decrease the uncertainty in each node's location estimate. On the other hand, due to dead reckoning and other systematic errors, the robot loses positional accuracy over time. Updates from GPS and from the localized sensor nodes serve in improving the localization uncertainty of the robot. A Continuous-Discrete Extended Kalman Filter (CD EKF) running on the mobile robot fuses information from multiple distinct sources (GPS, various sensors nodes) for robot navigation. This two-part procedure achieves simultaneous localization of the sensor nodes and the mobile robot. Also presented is an adaptive localization strategy to navigate the mobile robot to the area of least localized sensor nodes. This ensures that the robot maneuvers to an area where the sensor nodes possess the largest uncertainty in location, so that it can maximize the usefulness of its positional information in best localizing the overall network.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1282221.1282223",""

The commonly cited explanation is that selective inhibition of COX-2 leads to depletion of prostacyclin, whereas the production of pro-thrombotic thromboxane by means of cycloxygenase-1 (COX-1) is unopposed. This hypothesis seems unlikely as the overall explanation, because low-dose aspirin does not decrease the increased risk associated with COX-2 inhibitors. Moreover, the risk associated with nonselective COX inhibitors may be similar to selective COX-2 inhibitors. Alternative hypotheses include (1) elevated blood pressure, (2) abnormal vascular remodeling, (3) inhibition of protective mechanisms against ischemia—reperfusion injury, and (4) inhibition of 15-epi-lipoxin production. Varying results in different experimental models may be related to the fact that COX-2 is involved in numerous cellular functions. Inhibiting COX-2 in inflammatory cells may have favorable effects, whereas in organs such as the heart and brain and/or blood vessels may have deleterious effects. Currently, the “selective COX-2 inhibitors” are not selective in the sense that they inhibit COX-2 in all tissues without predilection to inflammatory cells and, as a result, may summate to increase the risk of cardiovascular events.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1074248407301172",""

We formulated the procedures to measure the ratios of the compensated fractions of both c domains and in-plane domains and the ratios of the components of the nonlinear susceptibility tensor under only a non-normal incidence of the fundamental beam. We applied this technique to characterize the domain microstructures of the Pb0.35Sr0.65TiO3 films at three typical temperatures (78, 150, and 300K) and found these films to exhibit a larger compensated fraction of c domains. The ratios of the components of the nonlinear susceptibility tensor were calculated to be relatively constant regardless of the temperature and the oxygen pressure. On the other hand, their SHG intensities were found to increase as the oxygen pressure goes lower, which is attributed to the higher density of the oxygen vacancies in the films.

Imaging of his brain revealed partial agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC). We discuss the known genetic basis of both JME and ACC, as well as the role of the corpus callosum (CC) in primary generalized epilepsy. Both JME and ACC are associated with gene loci on chromosome 15q14. Structural brain abnormalities other than ACC, such as atrophy of the corpus callosum have been reported in patients with JME. ACC has been associated with seizures, suggesting an anti‐epileptogenic role of the corpus callosum. On the other hand, corpus callosotomy is used to treat refractory idiopathic generalized epilepsy, which shows that the corpus callosum may play an epileptogenic role. The occurrence of both these conditions in one patient raises the question of whether they are purely coincidental or if there is a common basis for both. Several issues need to be addressed: the mechanism of seizure generalization in the setting of partial ACC, the possible role of other structures in generalization, and whether the ACC contributes to epileptogenesis as a result of the lack of a normal CC inhibitory effect.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1684/epd.2007.0129",""

Absorption measurements extend from 5000to340nm. From analyses of temperature-dependent (hot-band) absorption spectra, many of the crystal-field split energy (Stark) levels of the LJ2S+1 multiplet manifolds of Tb3+ are identified and confirmed from analyses of the fluorescence spectra observed between 485 and 680nm, representing transitions from the D45 to the FJ7 manifolds. Each manifold is split by the crystal field into 2J+1 Stark levels. Some of these manifolds, including the ground-state manifold F67, consist of Stark levels that are accidentally degenerate, or nearly so, making transitions to or from these levels appear as unresolved spectra, even at the lowest temperature investigated (1.8K). To resolve these spectra, we have investigated the Zeeman and magneto-optical spectra for representative manifolds D45, F57, and F67 at temperatures of 78 and 85K and magnetic fields up to 7kOe. The data are interpreted using the Stark levels and wave functions from a crystal-field splitting calculation that involved 80 individual Stark levels identified from the optical spectra of the FJ7 and quintet states reported in this study. Good agreement is obtained between the calculated and the experimental Stark levels. The calculated energy and symmetry label for each Stark level in the D45, F57, and F67 manifolds suitably interpret the spectral properties observed in the magneto-optical spectra, including the experimental assignment reported in the literature for the ground state as a quasidoublet {Γ1,Γ2}.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.2408344/14886723/023108_1_online.pdf",""

Here, we used a combinatorial phage display–based approach (“epitope mapping”) to select peptides binding to the original PAL-E antibody. We found that a subset of the selected panel of peptides had motifs with strong homology to an exposed site within the b1 domain of human neuropilin-1 (NRP-1). We confirmed peptide binding by ELISA and by surface plasmon resonance. We also showed that the PAL-E antigen colocalizes with NRP-1 staining in endothelial cells. Crystal structure of the b1 domain in NRP-1 suggests that the PAL-E binding site overlaps with a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) binding site. Taken together, these results indicate that NRP-1 is an endothelial cell antigen recognized by the true PAL-E antibody. The consistent biochemical, morphologic, and functional features between the PAL-E antigen and NRP-1 support our interpretation. Given that NRP-1 is a VEGF receptor, these results explain the attributes of the PAL-E antibody as a marker of vascular permeability and angiogenesis.

Complement C5a (anaphylatoxin) secreted by mycobacteria-infected macrophages regulates IL-12p70 production. As IL-12p70 regulates Th1 immunity against mycobacteria in mice, we examined the effects of C5a on IL-12p70 secretion by murine DCs and Th1 immunity. DCs cultured from C5-deficient (C5−/−) and -sufficient (C5+/+) mice were infected with BCG in the presence or absence of the C5a peptide. ELISA showed that C5−/− DCs secreted less IL-12p70 (600 pg/mL vs. 100 pg/mL) than C5+/+ DCs, and they secreted more IL-10. Using immunophenotyping, reduced CD40 expression was found on C5−/− DCs after BCG infection. BCG-primed DCs were then cocultured with naive or BCG-immune T cells to differentiate them into IFN-γ-secreting Th1 T cells. Coincident with increased IL-12p70 levels, BCG-primed C5+/+ DCs cocultured with naive or immune C5+/+ T cells showed a larger increase in CD4+ IFN-γ/CD8+ IFN-γ+ T cells compared with cocultured DCs and T cells from C5−/− mice. Thus, BCG-primed C5+/+ DCs were better able to drive a Th1 response. Furthermore, BCG aerosol-infected C5−/− mice showed reduced CD4 and CD8 IFN-γ-secreting T cells in the lungs, concurrent with an increased growth of BCG. Thus, C5a, an innate peptide, appears to play an important role in the generation of acquired immune responses in mice by regulating the Th1 response through modulation of IL-12p70 secretion from DCs.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1189%2Fjlb.0206119",""

The porosity of the low-κ films was found to decrease during processing due to tantalum and fluorine indiffusion (fluorine potentially depositing as fluorocarbon film in the pores) while oxygen indiffusion depleted carbon (possibly by forming volatile CO and CO2). Carbon removal from the low-κ film alters the film’s dielectric constant and refractive index. The depth of the indiffusion appears to be independent of diffusant (fluorocarbon, oxygen, or tantalum), ranging from 40to150nm, and to correlate directly to the pore structure. It was also found that water (moisture) in these films significantly affects the measured porosity as well as can be used to reduce the indiffusion of fluorine containing molecules by a factor of 2.

We investigated whether the pattern of such effects was similar to those we reported previously for passive viewing. Consistent with our previous study, the current results indicated that, during active control, mean response time to detect deceleration was longer when headway was relatively far or when deceleration rate was relatively slow.

The high uncertainties in the ozone prediction in Houston and surrounding areas due to small initial wind and temperature uncertainties clearly demonstrated the importance of accurate representation of meteorological conditions for the Houston ozone prediction and the need for probabilistic evaluation and forecasting for air pollution, especially those supported by regulating agencies.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2006JD007429",""

To detect head-on collisions, drivers must judge effectively the direction or heading of their own vehicle in relation to the heading of oncoming vehicles. In our previous study, we used computer simulations of self-motion through a traffic scene to measure judgments about whether a head-on collision was imminent. Results suggested that judgments about head-on collision are affected by both the optical flow information provided by the centerline and the optical flow information provided by the oncoming car. The objective of the current study was to further examine the effect of different components of the optical flow pattern on judgments of head-on collisions. We measured judgments about head on collisions while manipulating local optical flow from the oncoming car and global optical flow from the background scenery. Our results suggest that visual information about the oncoming car's motion was more effective than visual information about self motion. The implication is that it may be beneficial for drivers to focus greater attention on the information about the oncoming car's motion in order to improve judgments about head-on collisions.

Large field size and easy fabrication are two major advantages when compared with other imprint technology. Atomic force microscopy images showed that the molded structures had high fidelity to the masters. Less than 3% reduction of the depth in the molded structures was achieved with respect to the master. The increase of the surface roughness from the master to the molded structures is minimal. The issue of pattern collapse during pattern transfer of submicron structures was analyzed against the pattern dimensions and aspect ratios; and the experimental results were found in agreement with a prior theory.

To accomplish this, we introduce an efficient algorithm to calculate partial molar excess entropies from the transition-matrix Monte Carlo simulation data. We find that the species-dependent self-diffusivities of confined fluids are very similar to those of the bulk mixture if compared at the same, appropriately defined, packing fraction up to intermediate values, but then deviate negatively from the bulk behavior at higher packing fractions. On the other hand, the relationships between self-diffusivity and partial molar excess entropy (or total excess entropy) observed in the bulk fluid are preserved under confinement even at relatively high packing fractions and for different mixture compositions. This suggests that the excess entropy, calculable from classical density functional theories of inhomogeneous fluids, can be used to predict some of the nontrivial dynamical behaviors of fluid mixtures in confined environments.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.2795699/15408123/154513_1_online.pdf",""

It is intended for computationally efficient simulation of devices with large variations in characteristic length scale—for example those incorporating both micro- and nanochannels. The model represents both volume charge in the fluid and surface charge on the channel walls as equivalent linear charge densities. The relative importance of the surface terms is captured by a so-called “overlap parameter” that accounts for electric double-layer effects, such as selective ion transport. Scale transitions are implemented using position-dependent area and perimeter functions. The model is validated against experimental results previously reported in the literature. In particular, model predictions are compared to measurements of fluorescent tracer species in nanochannels, of nanochannel conductivity, and of the relative enhancement and depletion of negatively and positively charged tracer species in a device combining micro- and nanochannels. Surface charge density is a critical model parameter, but in practice it is often poorly known. Therefore it is also shown how the model may be used to estimate surface charge density based on measurements. In two of the three experiments studied the externally applied voltage is low, and excellent results are achieved with electroosmotic terms neglected. In the remaining case a large external potential (∼ 1 kV) is applied, necessitating an additional adjustable parameter to capture convective transport. With this addition, model performance is excellent.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2007-42752/2674325/985_1.pdf",""

Changes in medial collagen and elastin were examined by picrosirius red and Verhoeff–van Gieson staining, respectively. LabVIEW-based image analysis routines were developed to objectively and efficiently quantify the (immuno)histochemical results. We found that significant cell proliferation and matrix production occurred in the early stages of this coarctation model and then declined gradually; the SMCs also tended to exhibit a less contractile phenotype following these cellular and extracellular changes. Specifically, different aspects of the phenotypic changes associated with hypertension occurred at different rates: cell proliferation and collagen production occurred early and peaked by 2 weeks, whereas changes in contractile protein expression continued to decrease over the entire 8-week study period. Temporal changes found in this study emphasize the importance of simultaneously tracing time courses of SMC growth and differentiation as well as matrix protein production and content. SMCs are multifunctional, and caution must be used to not overdefine phenotype. This manuscript contains online supplemental material at http://www.jhc.org .

Precise optical component alignment and accurate thermal management is critical to achieve component and system performance capabilities. As the requirements for higher signal speeds and higher data rates grow, and as operating frequencies move to the higher GHz regions and beyond, the choice of packaging technology becomes critical. Optical MEMS packages not only have to provide electrical connections but also support high precision optics and mechanics, vital for operation of optical MEMS devices. Analogous to MEMS, packaging is also a critical path in reliability and cost of MOEMS devices. One of the commonly observed failures is the de-lamination between the chip (die) and the die attach.

There have been recent reports of the secretion of a cleaved NSP4 fragment (residues 112 to 175) and of the association of NSP4 with LC3-positive autophagosomes, raft membranes, and microtubules. To determine if NSP4 traffics to a specific subset of rafts at the plasma membrane, we isolated caveolae from plasma membrane-enriched material that yielded caveola membranes free of endoplasmic reticulum and nonraft plasma membrane markers. Analyses of the newly isolated caveolae from rotavirus-infected MDCK cells revealed full-length, high-mannose glycosylated NSP4. The lack of Golgi network-specific processing of the caveolar NSP4 glycans supports studies showing that NSP4 bypasses the Golgi apparatus. Confocal imaging showed the colocalization of NSP4 with caveolin-1 early and late in infection, elucidating the temporal and spatial NSP4-caveolin-1 association during infection. These data were extended with fluorescent resonance energy transfer analyses that confirmed the NSP4 and caveolin-1 interaction in that the specific fluorescently tagged antibodies were within 10 nm of each other during infection. Cells transfected with NSP4 showed patterns of staining and colocalization with caveolin-1 similar to those of infected cells. This study presents an endoplasmic reticulum contaminant-free caveola isolation protocol; describes the presence of full-length, endoglycosidase H-sensitive NSP4 in plasma membrane caveolae; provides confirmation of the NSP4-caveolin interaction in the presence and absence of other viral proteins; and provides a final plasma membrane destination for Golgi network-bypassing NSP4 transport.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.01862-06",""

The histone variant H2AX is phosphorylated on Ser139 (γ-H2AX) and forms nuclear foci at sites of DNA damage. Here, we characterize the concentration- and time-dependent phosphorylation of H2AX in response to gemcitabine-induced stalled replication forks. The number of γ-H2AX foci increased with time up to 2 to 6 h after exposure to gemcitabine, whereas longer exposures did not cause greater phosphorylation or increase cell death. The percentage of γ-H2AX–positive cells increased with concentrations of gemcitabine up to 0.1 μmol/L, and γ-H2AX was most evident in the S-phase fraction. Phosphorylation of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) on Ser1981 was also associated with S-phase cells and colocalized in the nucleus with phosphorylated H2AX foci after gemcitabine exposure. Chemical inhibition of ATM, ATM- and Rad3-related, and DNA-dependent protein kinase blocked H2AX phosphorylation. H2AX and ATM phosphorylation were associated with inhibition of DNA synthesis, S-phase accumulation, and activation of the S-phase checkpoint pathway (Chk1/Cdc25A/cyclin-dependent kinase 2). Exposure of previously gemcitabine-treated cultures to the Chk1 inhibitor 7-hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01) caused a 10-fold increase in H2AX phosphorylation, which was displayed as an even pan-nuclear staining. This increased phosphorylation was not due to apoptosis-induced DNA fragmentation and was associated with the S-phase fraction and decreased reproductive viability. Thus, H2AX becomes phosphorylated and forms nuclear foci in response to gemcitabine-induced stalled replication forks, and this is greatly increased upon checkpoint abrogation.

This study identified, in adult adipose tissue, a subpopulation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that coexpresses telomerase and myocardin A, a key regulator of cardiovascular myogenic development. The telomerase/myocardin A-positive MSCs differentiated into cardiovascular myogenic cells while retaining expression and activation of the telomerase catalytic unit, telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), at a level comparable to that of ESCs. Both myocardin A and TERT could be coimmunoprecipitated from the developing MSCs and ESC-derived EBs with either anti-TERT or anti-myocardin A antibodies, suggesting the formation of TERT-myocardin A complexes in the MSCs and EBs. The proteins pulled down with anti-myocardin antibodies showed almost the same levels of telomerase activities as those precipitated with anti-TERT antibodies.

We postulated that mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells possess enzymes to synthesize protective prostaglandins. Compared with differentiated adult cells, mES cells were less susceptible to H2O2-induced apoptosis. However, their apoptosis was enhanced by indomethacin or SC-236, a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. Analysis of COX pathway enzymes by Western blotting revealed expression of COX-2 and cytosolic and microsomal prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthases. COX-1 and prostacyclin (PGI2) synthases were undetectable. mES cells produced PGE2 but not PGI2. Importantly, PGE2 rescued mES cells from apoptosis. To elucidate the signaling mechanism by which PGE2 inhibits apoptosis, we analyzed E-type prostaglandin (EP) receptors by Western blots. All EP isoforms were detected except EP4. Butaprost, a specific EP2 agonist, rescued mES cells from apoptosis, whereas sulprostone, an EP1/EP3 agonist, had no effect, suggesting selective interaction of PGE2 with EP2. The antiapoptotic effect of PGE2 was abrogated by Ly-294002 or wortmannin but not H-89 or a specific inhibitor of protein kinase A, suggesting signaling via phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K). Akt was constitutively active in mES cells, which were inhibited by indomethacin and rescued by PGE2. The rescuing effect of PGE2 was abrogated by Ly-294002. These results indicate that mES cells constitutively express COX-2 and PGE synthases and produce PGE2, which confers resistance to apoptosis via EP2-mediated activation of PI-3K to the Akt pathway.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1634/stemcells.2006-0505",""

The values of Dtrans vary by five to six orders of magnitude in this temperature range. Contrary to the predictions of the Stokes-Einstein equation, the temperature dependence of probe diffusion in SB over the temperature range of the measurements is weaker than that of T∕η, where η is the shear viscosity. In going from the crossover temperature Tx≈1.2Tg to Tg, Dtransη∕T increases by factors of 2.4±0.2 decades for rubrene, 3.4±0.2 decades for BPEA, and 3.8±0.4 decades for tetracene. The decoupling between probe diffusion in SB and viscosity is characterized by the scaling law Dtrans∼T∕ηξ, with ξ=0.621 for tetracene, 0.654 for BPEA, and 0.722 for rubrene. Data for probe diffusion in SB are combined with data from the literature for probe diffusion in ortho-terphenyl and ααβ-tris(naphthyl)benzene in a plot of enhancement versus the relative probe size parameter ρm=(mp∕mh)1∕3, where mp and mh are, respectively, the molecular weights of the probe and host solvent. The plot clearly shows a sharp increase in enhancement of translational diffusion at ρm≈1. By applying temperature shifts, Dtrans for probe diffusion in SB and the dielectric relaxation time τD can be superimposed on a single master curve based on the Williams-Landel-Ferry equation. This suggests that the dynamics of probe diffusion in SB is described by the scaling relationship Dtrans∼1∕τD(T+ΔT), where τD(T+ΔT) is the temperature-shifted dielectric relaxation time.

In addition, overexpression of IKKα in the epidermis inhibited the development of skin carcinomas and metastases in mice. However, whether a reduction in IKKα expression promotes skin tumor development is currently unknown. Here, we assessed the susceptibility of Ikkα hemizygotes to chemical carcinogen-induced skin carcinogenesis. Ikkα+/− mice developed 2 times more papillomas and 11 times more carcinomas than did Ikkα+/+ mice. The tumors were larger in Ikkα+/− than in Ikkα+/+ mice, but tumor latency was shorter in Ikkα+/− than in Ikkα+/+ mice. Some of the Ikkα+/− papillomas and most Ikkα+/− carcinomas lost the remaining Ikkα wild-type allele. Somatic Ikkα mutations were detected in carcinomas and papillomas. The chemical carcinogen-induced H-Ras mutations were detected in all the tumors. The phorbol ester tumor promoter induced higher mitogenic and angiogenic activities in Ikkα+/− than in Ikkα+/+ skin. These elevated activities were intrinsic to keratinocytes, suggesting that a reduction in IKKα expression provided a selective growth advantage, which cooperated with H-Ras mutations to promote papilloma formation. Furthermore, excessive extracellular signal-regulated kinase and IKK kinase activities were observed in carcinomas compared with those in papillomas. Thus, the combined mitogenic, angiogenic, and IKK activities might contribute to malignant conversion. Our findings provide evidence that a reduction in IKKα expression promotes the development of papillomas and carcinomas and that the integrity of the Ikkα gene is required for suppressing skin carcinogenesis.

Similar to the circadian profiling of the SCN2.2 and rat SCN transcriptomes, NIH/3T3 fibroblasts exhibited circadian fluctuations in the expression of the core clock genes, Per2, Cry1, and Bmal1, and 323 functionally diverse transcripts, many of which regulate cellular communication. Overlap in rhythmic transcripts among NIH/3T3 fibroblasts, SCN2.2 cells, and the rat SCN was limited to these clock genes and four other genes that mediate fatty acid and lipid metabolism or function as nuclear factors. Compared with NIH/3T3 cells, circadian gene expression in SCN oscillators was more prevalent among genes mediating glucose metabolism and neurotransmission. Coupled with evidence for the rhythmic regulation of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase ( iNos) in SCN2.2 cells and the rat SCN but not in fibroblasts, studies examining the effects of a NOS inhibitor on metabolic rhythms in cocultures containing SCN2.2 cells and untreated NIH/3T3 cells suggest that the gaseous neurotransmitter nitric oxide may play a key role in SCN pacemaker function.

During the last few thousand years, the New World viruses, including Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) and eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), evolved separately from those of the Old World, i.e., Sindbis virus (SINV) and Semliki Forest virus (SFV). Nevertheless, the results of our study indicate that both groups have developed the same characteristic: their replication efficiently interferes with cellular transcription and the cell response to virus replication. Transcriptional shutoff caused by at least two of the Old World alphaviruses, SINV and SFV, which belong to different serological complexes, depends on nsP2, but not on the capsid protein, functioning. Our data suggest that the New World alphaviruses VEEV and EEEV developed an alternative mechanism of transcription inhibition that is mainly determined by their capsid protein, but not by the nsP2. The ability of the VEEV capsid to inhibit cellular transcription appears to be controlled by the amino-terminal fragment of the protein, but not by its protease activity or by the positively charged RNA-binding domain. These data provide new insights into alphavirus evolution and present a plausible explanation for the particular recombination events that led to the formation of western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) from SINV- and EEEV-like ancestors. The recombination allowed WEEV to acquire capsid protein functioning in transcription inhibition from EEEV-like virus. Identification of the new functions in the New World alphavirus-derived capsids opens an opportunity for developing new, safer alphavirus-based gene expression systems and designing new types of attenuated vaccine strains of VEEV and EEEV.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.02073-06",""

Sulindac sulfide inhibited 14-3-3ε proteins in HT-29 and DLD-1 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Sulindac sulfone at 600 μmol/L inhibited 14-3-3ε protein expression in HT-29. Indomethacin and SC-236, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, exerted a similar effect as sulindac. Sulindac suppressed 14-3-3ε promoter activity. As 14-3-3ε promoter activation is mediated by peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor δ (PPARδ), we determined the correlation between 14-3-3ε inhibition and PPARδ suppression by NSAIDs. Sulindac sulfide inhibited PPARδ protein expression and PPARδ transcriptional activity. Overexpression of PPARδ by adenoviral transfer rescued 14-3-3ε proteins from elimination by sulindac or indomethacin. NSAID-induced 14-3-3ε suppression was associated with reduced cytosolic Bad with elevation of mitochondrial Bad and increase in apoptosis which was rescued by Ad-PPARδ transduction. Stable expression of 14-3-3ε in HT-29 significantly protected cells from apoptosis. Our findings shed light on a novel mechanism by which NSAIDs induce colorectal cancer apoptosis via the PPARδ/14-3-3ε transcriptional pathway.

The method combines a microelectrothermal test structure with a finite-element-based data analysis procedure. The test device consists of two serpentine nickel structures, which serve as resistive heaters and resistance temperature detectors, on top of the sample. The sample is supported by a silicon nitride membrane. Analytical solution of the heat flow is infeasible, making interpretation of the data difficult. To address this, we use a finite-element model of the test structure, and apply nonlinear least-squares estimation to extract the desired material parameter values. The approach permits simultaneous extraction of multiple parameters. We demonstrate our technique by simultaneously obtaining the thermal conductivity of a 280 μm by 80 μm by 140 nm thick aluminum sample and the 360 μm by 160 μm by 180 nm thick silicon nitride support membrane. The thermal conductivity measured for the silicon nitride thin film is 2.1 W/mK, in agreement with reported values for films of this thickness. The thermal conductivity of the Al thin film is found to be 94 W/mK—significantly lower than reported bulk values, and consistent both with reported trends for thin metallic films and with values obtained using electrical resistivity measurements and the Wiedemann-Franz law.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IMECE2007-42750/2674207/639_1.pdf",""

One problem of the present VoIP networks is filtering spam calls referred to as SPIT (Spam over Internet Telephony). Unlike spam in e-mail systems, VoIP spam calls have to be identified in real time. Many of the techniques devised for e-mail spam detection rely upon content analysis, and in the case of VoIP, it is too late to analyze the content (voice) as the user would have already attended the call. Therefore, the real challenge is to block a spam call before the telephone rings. In addition, we believe it is imperative that spam filters integrate human behavioral aspects to gauge the legitimacy of voice calls. We know that, when it comes to receiving or rejecting a voice call, people use the social meaning of trust, reputation, friendship of the calling party and their own mood. In this article, we describe a multi-stage, adaptive spam filter based on presence (location, mood, time), trust, and reputation to detect spam in voice calls. In particular, we describe a closed-loop feedback control between different stages to decide whether an incoming call is spam. We further propose formalism for voice-specific trust and reputation analysis. We base this formal model on a human intuitive behavior for detecting spam based on the called party's direct and indirect relationships with the calling party. No VoIP corpus is available for testing the detection mechanism. Therefore, for verifying the detection accuracy, we used a laboratory setup of several soft-phones, real IP phones and a commercial-grade proxy server that receives and processes incoming calls. We experimentally validated the proposed filtering mechanisms by simulating spam calls and measured the filter's accuracy by applying the trust and reputation formalism. We observed that, while the filter blocks a second spam call from a spammer calling from the same end IP host and domain, the filter needs only a maximum of three calls---even in the case when spammer moves to a new host and domain. Finally, we present a detailed sensitivity analysis for examining the influence of parameters such as spam volume and network size on the filter's accuracy.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1216895.1216897",""

Thus, pyruvate cycling flux increased in proportion to TCA cycle flux, leaving net gluconeogenesis unchanged in fa/fa animals compared with control animals.

Molecular modeling demonstrated that the catalytic residues of mNsp15 are superimposable with its severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ortholog. Alanine substitutions at three key residues in the mNsp15 catalytic pocket (H262, H277, and G275) and a double-mutant version (H262P and H277A) generated proteins with greatly reduced but detectable endoribonuclease activities. Furthermore, these mutant proteins demonstrated lower cleavage specificities for uridylate than wild-type (WT) mNsp15. These mutations were successfully incorporated into viruses named vH262A, vH277A, vG275A, and vH262P+H277A.

Equations of motion for these trajectories are derived through use of the derivative propagation method (DPM), which leads to a hierarchy of coupled differential equations for the action function and its spatial derivatives along each trajectory. In this study, complex-valued classical trajectories (second order DPM), along which is transported quantum phase information, are used to study low energy barrier transmission for a model two-dimensional system involving either an Eckart or Gaussian barrier along the reaction coordinate coupled to a harmonic oscillator. The arrival time for trajectories to reach the transmitted (product) region is studied. Trajectories launched from an “equal arrival time surface,” defined as an isochrone, all reach the real-valued subspace in the transmitted region at the same time. The Rutherford-type diffraction of trajectories around poles in the complex extended Eckart potential energy surface is described. For thin barriers, these poles are close to the real axis and present problems for computing the transmitted density. In contrast, for the Gaussian barrier or the thick Eckart barrier where the poles are further from the real axis, smooth transmitted densities are obtained. Results obtained using higher-order quantum trajectories (third order DPM) are described for both thick and thin barriers, and some issues that arise for thin barriers are examined.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.2746869/13265360/044103_1_online.pdf",""

In this study we tested whether colonization of roots by T. virens can induce systemic protection against a foliar pathogen in the monocot maize (Zea mays), and we further demonstrated the importance of Sm1 during maize-fungal interactions using a functional genomics approach. Maize seedlings were inoculated with T. virens Gv29-8 wild type and transformants in which SM1 was disrupted or constitutively overexpressed in a hydroponic system or in soil-grown maize seedlings challenged with the pathogen Colletotrichum graminicola. We show that similar to dicot plants, colonization of maize roots by T. virens induces systemic protection of the leaves inoculated with C. graminicola. This protection was associated with notable induction of jasmonic acid- and green leaf volatile-biosynthetic genes. Neither deletion nor overexpression of SM1 affected normal growth or development of T. virens, conidial germination, production of gliotoxin, hyphal coiling, hydrophobicity, or the ability to colonize maize roots. Plant bioassays showed that maize grown with SM1-deletion strains exhibited the same levels of systemic protection as non-Trichoderma-treated plants. Moreover, deletion and overexpression of SM1 resulted in significantly reduced and enhanced levels of disease protection, respectively, compared to the wild type. These data together indicate that T. virens is able to effectively activate systemic disease protection in maize and that the functional Sm1 elicitor is required for this activity.","http://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-pdf/145/3/875/37071025/plphys_v145_3_875.pdf",""

It has been demonstrated that a three-dimensional, instead of a two-dimensional, formulation predicts significantly greater values of stress. Dimensionless coordinates were used to essentially simplify the stress analysis and reduce the number of calculations. In addition, thermoelasticity approach simplifies the study of stresses for a nonstationary temperature field. The stress in the AlN film along the thickness or [0001] growth direction is essentially zero but the in-plane stress is large. The stress at the corner of the film is much higher due to stress concentration and could cause formation of microcracks. The stress in the film is tensile while that in the substrate is compressive, which causes a reversal of the stress across the interface. Separation or delamination of the film from the substrate could occur due to this reversal of the stress at the interface. The stress decreases as the thickness of the film increases or the thickness of the substrate decreases. Thus, formation of microscopic cracks in the film could be avoided by using a thinner substrate. The analysis on interaction of neighboring islands in order to simulate coalescence of island growth indicates stress concentration at the boundaries of the islands, which could produce threading dislocations and hence polycrystalline growth. The analysis of the effect of misorientation of the neighboring grains on the residual thermal stress in the film has shown that a large stress can develop at the grain boundary and can lead to grain boundary cracking.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.2778741/14995587/063525_1_online.pdf",""

Using a commercial respiratory motion phantom and a programmable moving platform with a CT phantom, we acquired 4D CT datasets on two commercial multislice helical CT scanners that use different approaches to 4D CT image reconstruction. Datasets were obtained as the platform moved in various patterns designed to simulate breathing. Known inserts in the phantom were contoured, and statistics were generated to evaluate properties important to radiation therapy—namely, accuracy of phase‐binning, shape, volume, and CT number. Phase‐binning accuracy varied by as much as 5% for a 4D procedure in which images were reconstructed and then binned, but exhibited no variation for a 4D procedure in which projections were binned before reconstruction. The magnitude of geometric distortion was found to be small for both approaches, as was the magnitude of volume error. Partial‐volume effects in the direction perpendicular to the transverse planes of reconstruction affected volume accuracy, however. Computed tomography numbers were reproduced accurately, but 4D images exhibited more variation in CT number than static CT images did. Characterization of such properties can be used to better understand and optimize the various parameters that affect 4D CT image quality.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1120%2Fjacmp.v8i3.2362",""

A pronounced eddy is present at the largest aperture zone of the actual fracture resulting in a power‐law tail absent in other cases. The uniform aperture fracture has the largest effective dispersion coefficient estimated via inversion of a 1D analytical model. The analytical model fit to the other cases is not as robust as in the uniform aperture case.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2007GL030545",""

The dramatically increased speed with which regions may be searched, when compared to other high resolution microwave techniques, allows the source conditions to be the prime variable in laser ablation microwave spectroscopic studies. A second feature of the technique is that observed spectral features have correct relative intensities. This is advantageous when assigning observed spectra. The study of two metal chlorides, AgCl and AuCl, illustrate the instrument’s benefits.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/rsi/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.2786022/14819680/096106_1_online.pdf",""

The nanocrystalline particles were synthesized from a homogenous solution of the metal ions and urea at elevated temperatures in order to control the precipitation of the mixed hydroxides by a slow uniform reaction throughout the solution. The morphology of the calcinated materials revealed uniformly spherical aggregates 200nm or less depending on the ratio of the metal ions in the initial solution. Spectra obtained from these particles were analyzed in detail for the crystal-field splitting of the LJ2S+1 multiplet manifolds of Er3+(4f11) including the ground-state manifold I15∕24, and excited manifolds I9∕24, F9∕24, S3∕24, H11∕22, F7∕24, F5∕24, and F3∕24.

Specifically, we analyze the sensitivity of through-casing measurements for detecting water invasion, shale-laminated sands, and electrical anisotropy in the formation. In addition, we study the influence of the frequency of operation on through-casing resistivity measurements. The sensitivity analysis is performed using a highly accurate and reliable numerical method based on a 2D self-adaptive, goal-oriented, high-order, finite-element method (FEM). This method can be applied to simulate all types of resistivity logging measurements, including normal/laterolog, induction, and through-casing resistivity measurements. Results quantify the effects of several physical phenomena that can be sensed through casing and that can be measured with accurate sensors. We find that water invasion and shale-laminated sands behind casing can be detected and accurately quantified at frequencies below [Formula: see text]. On the other hand, measurements are almost insensitive to electrical anisotropy behind casing, but otherwise highly sensitive to frequency variations. Our simulations indicate that a frequency in the range of [Formula: see text] is the most adequate for maximizing the sensitivity of through-casing measurements with respect to spatial variations of electrical conductivity within the formation.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/1.2712058",""

In this analysis, we stratified patients as to their preradiation PSA levels and correlated it with outcomes such as PSA treatment failure, local recurrence, and distant failure, to serve as guidelines for future research. Patients and Methods: Four hundred thirty-one subjects with pathologically advanced prostate cancer (extraprostatic extension, positive surgical margins, or seminal vesicle invasion) were randomly assigned to adjuvant radiotherapy or observation. Results: Three hundred seventy-four eligible patients had immediate postprostatectomy and follow-up PSA data. Median follow-up was 10.2 years. For patients with a postsurgical PSA of ≤ 0.2 ng/mL, radiation was associated with reductions in the 10-year risk of biochemical treatment failure (72% to 42%), local failures (20% to 7%), and distant failures (12% to 4%). For patients with a postsurgical PSA between higher than 0.2 and ≤ 1.0 ng/mL, reductions in the 10-year risk of biochemical failure (80% to 73%), local failures (25% to 9%), and distant failures (16% to 12%) were realized. In patients with postsurgical PSA higher than 1.0, the respective findings were 94% versus 100%, 28% versus 9%, and 44% versus 18%. Conclusion: The pattern of treatment failure in high-risk patients is predominantly local with a surprisingly low incidence of metastatic failure. Adjuvant radiation to the prostate bed reduces the risk of metastatic disease and biochemical failure at all postsurgical PSA levels. Further improvement in reducing local treatment failure is likely to have the greatest impact on outcome in high-risk patients after prostatectomy.","https://ascopubs.org/doi/pdfdirect/10.1200/JCO.2006.09.6495",""

Methods: Records of 112 patients were reviewed. Standardized FLR (sFLR) and degree of hypertrophy (DH; difference between the sFLR before and after PVE), complications and outcomes were analysed to determine cut-offs that predict postoperative hepatic dysfunction. Results: Ten (8·9 per cent) of 112 patients had PVE-related complications. Postoperative complications occurred in 34 (44 per cent) of 78 patients who underwent hepatic resection and the 90-day mortality rate was 3 per cent. A sFLR of 20 per cent or less after PVE or DH of not more than 5 per cent (versus sFLR greater than 20 per cent and DH above 5 per cent) had a sensitivity of 80 per cent and a specificity of 94 per cent in predicting hepatic dysfunction. Overall, major and liver-related complications, hepatic dysfunction or insufficiency, hospital stay and 90-day mortality rate were significantly greater in patients with a sFLR of 20 per cent or less or DH of not more than 5 per cent compared with patients with higher values.

It is also observed that a high pressure expedites the FePt phase transition from the disordered face-centered-cubic structure to the L10 structure, leading to the phase transition temperature in the compacts one hundred degrees lower than usual. This phase transition in turn facilitates the consolidation of the compacts. Magnetic characterizations showed that interphase exchange coupling is enhanced upon the compaction. Post-annealing of the compacts results in further improved magnetic performance of the compacts owing to interface modification.

Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 are expressed in a panel of estrogen receptor (ER)–positive and ER-negative breast cancer cell lines, and we hypothesized that regulation of their expression may be due to microRNA-27a (miR-27a), which is also expressed in these cell lines and has been reported to regulate the zinc finger ZBTB10 gene, a putative Sp repressor. Transfection of ER-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with antisense miR-27a (as-miR-27a) resulted in increased expression of ZBTB10 mRNA and decreased expression of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 at the mRNA and protein levels and also decreased activity in cells transfected with constructs containing Sp1 and Sp3 promoter inserts. In addition, these responses were accompanied by decreased expression of Sp-dependent survival and angiogenic genes, including survivin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1). Moreover, similar results were observed in MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with ZBTB10 expression plasmid. Both as-miR-27a and ZBTB10 overexpression decreased the percentage of MDA-MB-231 cells in S phase of the cell cycle; however, ZBTB10 increased the percentage of cells in G0-G1, whereas as-miR-27a increased the percentage in G2-M. This latter response was associated with induction of Myt-1 (another miR-27a target gene), which inhibits G2-M through enhanced phosphorylation and inactivation of cdc2. Thus, the oncogenic activity of miR-27a in MDA-MB-231 cells is due, in part, to suppression of ZBTB10 and Myt-1.

Hypothesis: Landing from a jump creates high loads on the knee creating dynamic instability in women with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, whereas noninjured women have stable knee landing mechanics. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Fifteen noninjured women and 13 women with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction performed 5 trials of a single-legged 40-cm drop jump and 2 trials of a 20-cm up-down hop task. Multivariate analyses of variance were used to compare hip and knee joint kinematics, knee joint moments, ground-reaction forces, and electromyographic findings between the dominant leg in noninjured women and reconstructed leg in women with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Results: No statistically significant differences between groups were found for peak hip and knee joint angles for the drop jump task. Statistically significant differences in neuromuscular activity ( P = .001) and anterior-posterior knee shear forces ( P < .001) were seen in women with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction compared with noninjured women in the drop jump task.

Increased expression of BLyS and its receptors has been identified in numerous B-cell malignancies. We generated a fusion toxin designated rGel/BLyS for receptor-mediated delivery of the recombinant gelonin (rGel) toxin to neoplastic B cells, and we characterized its activity against various B-cell tumor lines. Three mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cell lines (JeKo-1, Mino, and SP53) and two diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines (SUDHL-6 and OCI-Ly3) expressing all three distinct BLyS receptors were found to be the most sensitive to the fusion toxin (IC50 = 2–5 pmol/L and 0.001–5 nmol/L for MCL and DLBCL, respectively). The rGel/BLyS fusion toxin showed specific binding to cells expressing BLyS receptors and rapid internalization of the rGel component into target cells. The cytotoxic effects of rGel/BLyS were inhibited by pretreatment with free BLyS or with soluble BAFF-R, TACI, and BCMA decoy receptors. This suggests that the cytotoxic effects of the fusion toxin are mediated through BLyS receptors. The rGel/BLyS fusion toxin inhibited MCL cell growth through induction of apoptosis associated with caspase-3 activation and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Our results suggest that BLyS has the potential to serve as an excellent targeting ligand for the specific delivery of cytotoxic molecules to neoplastic B cells expressing the BLyS receptors, and that the rGel/BLyS fusion toxin may be an excellent candidate for the treatment of B-cell malignancies especially MCL and DLBCL.

Surface reconstruction was observed at the two free silicon surfaces and at the constriction. The radius of the heated zone in the cold substrate was found to approach a limit of about 20 times the average nearest-neighbor distance of boron doping atoms when the constriction radius (a) is reduced below the interdopant distance. The phonon mean free path at the constriction was found to be suppressed by diffuse phonon-surface scattering and phonon-impurity scattering. The MD thermal resistance is close to the ballistic resistance when a is larger than 1nm, suggesting that surface reconstruction does not reduce the phonon transmission coefficient significantly. When a is 0.5nm and comparable to the dominant phonon wavelength, however, the MD result is considerably lower than the calculated ballistic resistance because bulk phonon dispersion and bulk potential are no longer accurate. The MD thermal resistance of the constriction increases slightly with increasing doping concentration due to the increase in the diffusive resistance.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.2715488/13496307/074304_1_online.pdf",""

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within a large haplotype block surrounding the alternate P2 promoter, located ∼45 kb upstream from the coding region, have been investigated in several populations of varying ethnicity with inconsistent results. Additionally, SNPs located within the P1 promoter and coding region have also been inconsistently associated with type 2 diabetes. Characterization of variation across this gene region in Mexican-American populations has not been reported. We therefore examined polymorphisms across the HNF4A gene in a cohort of Mexican-American pedigrees and assessed their association with type 2 diabetes. We observed evidence for association of SNPs in the P2 promoter region with type 2 diabetes (P = 0.003) and its age at diagnosis (P = 0.003). The risk allele frequency (53%) was intermediate to that reported in Caucasian populations (20–27%) and Pima Indians (83%). No other SNPs were associated with either trait.

Due to the nonlinear nature of the actuator performance parameters, it is often difficult to map component specifications to the overall system performance making it cumbersome to use these parameters to design the system. Specifying system requirements based on task specifications, on the other hand, provides greater insight into how the system must perform in order to complete a given task and the resources required to achieve this performance. In this paper, we present a method for optimal design of modular robotic manipulators using a finite set of actuators to execute various tasks. Three different tasks — material removal, welding and a pick-and-place operation — which have different requirements in terms of the force, speed, precision and energy required to perform them, are considered. A set of five actuators is used to form different serial robotic manipulator configurations whose ability to accomplish the task is then evaluated using various performance metrics. A sequential filtering method is used to eliminate infeasible manipulator configurations and the remaining feasible set of manipulator configurations are then optimized using the weighted sum and compromise multiobjective optimization methods to determine a Pareto optimal manipulator configuration to accomplish each of the three tasks individually, in addition to a fourth manipulator configuration that is capable of accomplishing all the three tasks.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/DETC2007-34499/4566806/533_1.pdf",""

The nano- and microscale morphologies of films were investigated and the electrical conductivities of films were measured in the as-deposited state and after annealing at temperatures from 100 to 400 °C. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to analyze the film morphologies and the grain sizes within the films. These analyses showed that the as-deposited grain size was 14–24 nm and the relative film densities ranged from 60% to 80%, depending on processing conditions. As a result of the extremely fine grain size and the lack of organics present on the surface of the grains within the films, the annealing temperatures required to achieve reasonable conductivities (20%−50% of bulk) were reduced dramatically compared to films produced from suspensions. For example, the grain size in the films began to increase at annealing temperatures of as low as 100 °C, and the corresponding conductivity was greater than 25% of the conductivity of bulk silver. Increases in annealing temperature resulted in greater coarsening and further increases in conductivity. Calculations showed that increases in conductivity during annealing at temperatures less than 400 °C resulted primarily from grain size coarsening rather than densification.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.2776163/14074227/054308_1_online.pdf",""

Detailed characterization of vceR in V. cholerae 569B confirmed the repressive effect of VceR on VCE function and indicated several novel features of VceR. Deletion of vceR increased resistance of strain 569B to CCCP and deoxycholate modestly, but did not affect resistance to pentachlorophenol. Transcriptional analysis revealed that vce expression was not only increased in strain 569BΔvceR::Ω by 2-fold but continued to rise throughout the growth cycle. Using a vceR–lux transcriptional fusion plasmid, we examined whether vceR is autoregulated in strain 569B. Expression of vceR from the vceR–lux fusion was significantly lower in strain 569BΔvceR::Ω than in strain 569B.

With nuclei fixed, there is a relatively small broadening associated with the finite time duration of an applied laser pulse. When the nuclei are allowed to move, the excitation spectrum exhibits a much larger broadening, and is also reduced in height and shifted toward lower frequencies. In both cases, the excitation is due to well-defined π to π* transitions.

In this study, we evaluate the dynamic effects of different themes of advertising that have been employed in a campaign. We develop a model that jointly considers the effects of wearout as well as that of forgetting in the context of an advertising campaign that employs five different advertising themes. We quantify the differential wearout effects across the different themes of advertising and examine the interaction effects between the different themes using a Bayesian dynamic linear model (DLM). Such a response model can help managers decide on the optimal allocation of resources across the portfolio of ads as well as better manage their scheduling. We develop a model to show how our response model parameters can be used to improve the effectiveness of advertising budget allocation across different themes.

WNT5A and WNT5B mRNAs were most abundant in the stroma and less so in the luminal epithelium, whereas WNT11 mRNA was detected primarily in the glands. WNT7A mRNA was present in the luminal epithelium on d 10, absent on d 12 and 14, and increased between d 16 and 20. Only WNT2, WNT2B, and WNT4 were detected in conceptus trophectoderm. FZD6/8 (frizzled receptor) and GSK3B (glycogen synthase kinase 3β) mRNAs were detected primarily in endometrial epithelia and conceptus trophectoderm, whereas the LRP5/6 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 5 and 6) coreceptor was present in all endometrial cells and the trophectoderm. DKK1 (Dickkopf), a WNT signaling inhibitor, increased in the endometrium from d 16–20. CTNNB1 [catenin (cadherin associated protein) β1] and CDH1 (E-cadherin) mRNAs were most abundant in the endometrial epithelia and trophectoderm. LEF1 (lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1) mRNA was expressed primarily in uterine epithelia, whereas TCF7L2 [(transcription factor 7-like 2 (T-cell specific, HMG-box)] was primarily in the conceptus.

It has been suggested that aberrant DNA methylation can affect the sensitivity of cancers to antineoplastic agents by altering expression of genes critical to drug response. To study this issue, we used bisulfite PCR to assess DNA methylation of 32 promoter-associated CpG islands in human cancer cell lines from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) drug-screening panel (NCI-60 panel). The frequency of aberrant hypermethylation of these islands ranged from 2% to 81% in NCI-60 cancer cells, and provided a database that can be analyzed for the sensitivity to ≈30,000 drugs tested in this panel. By correlating drug activity with DNA methylation, we identified a list of methylation markers that predict sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs. Among them, hypermethylation of the p53 homologue p73 and associated gene silencing was strongly correlated with sensitivity to alkylating agents. We used small interfering RNA to down-regulate p73 expression in multiple cell lines, including the resistant cell lines TK10 (renal cancer) and SKMEL28 (melanoma). Down-regulating p73 substantially increased sensitivity to commonly used alkylating agents, including cisplatin, indicating that epigenetic silencing of p73 directly modulates drug sensitivity. Our results confirm that epigenetic profiles are useful in identifying molecular mediators for cancer drug sensitivity (pharmaco-epigenomics).

To understand the mechanism for this effect of COX2, the present study examined the role of an enzyme downstream of COX2, namely thromboxane A synthase (TBXAS), in steroidogenesis. Inhibition of TBXAS activity with the inhibitor furegrelate induced a concentration-dependent increase in cAMP-induced steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein in MA-10 mouse Leydig cells. The increase in StAR protein occurred concomitantly with a significant increase in steroid hormone production. Similar results were obtained in StAR promoter activity assays and RT-PCR analyses of StAR mRNA levels, suggesting that inhibition of TBXAS activity enhanced StAR gene transcription. These observations were corroborated when TBXAS expression was specifically inhibited by RNA interference. Although the RNA interference reduced mRNA levels of TBXAS, it increased StAR mRNA levels, StAR protein, and steroidogenesis. Additional studies indicated that inhibition of TBXAS activity reduced DAX-1 protein, a repressor in StAR gene transcription. In the absence of cAMP, inhibition of TBXAS activity did not induce a significant increase in steroid hormone and StAR protein. However, addition of a low level of cAMP analogs dramatically increased steroidogenesis. Lastly, inhibition of protein kinase A activity essentially abolished the steroidogenic effect of the TBXAS inhibitor. Thus, the results from the present study suggest that a minimal level of protein kinase A activity is required for the steroidogenic effect of the TBXAS inhibitor and that inhibition of TBXAS activity or its expression increase the steroidogenic sensitivity of MA-10 mouse Leydig cells to cAMP stimulation.","http://academic.oup.com/endo/article-pdf/149/2/851/9000028/endo0851.pdf",""

Our ability to project future climate change, especially trends in costly precipitation extremes, hinges upon whether coupled GCMs capture processes that affect precipitation characteristics. Our study compares the tropical‐subtropical precipitation characteristics of simulations by the NCAR CAM3.1 atmospheric GCM and observations derived from the NASA Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite. Despite a fairly good simulation of the annual mean rain rate, CAM rains about 10–50% more often than the real world and fails to capture heavy rainfall associated with deep convective systems over subtropical South America and U.S. Southern Plains. When it rains, there is a likelihood of 0.96–1.0 that it rains lightly in the model, compared to values of 0.84–1.0 in TRMM data. On the other hand, the likelihood of the occurrence of moderate to heavy rainfall is an order of magnitude higher in observations (0.12–0.2) than that in the model (<0.02). Comparison of regionally aggregated PDFs of the rain rate shows that CAM underestimates the probability of NOT raining, overestimates the probability of light rain and almost completely misses the tails of the PDFs. The model compensates for the lack of heavy precipitation through raining more frequently within the light rain category, which leads to an annual rainfall amount close to what is observed. CAM captures the qualitative change of rain rate PDF from a “dry” oceanic to a “wet” oceanic region, but it fails to simulate the change of precipitation characteristics from an oceanic region to a land region where thunderstorm rainfall dominates.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2006GL027246",""

Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate is a necessary cofactor for the reductase activity of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (EC 1.1.1.146), which converts hormonally inactive cortisone to active cortisol (in rodents, 11-dehydrocorticosterone to corticosterone). Mice with targeted inactivation of hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase lack 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 reductase activity, whereas dehydrogenase activity (corticosterone to 11-dehydrocorticosterone) is increased. We now report that both glucose output and glucose use are abnormal in these mice. Mutant mice have fasting hypoglycemia. In mutant primary hepatocytes, glucose output does not increase normally in response to glucagon. Mutant animals have lower hepatic glycogen content when fed and cannot mobilize it normally when fasting. As assessed by RT-PCR, responses of hepatic enzymes to fasting are blunted; enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, tyrosine aminotransferase) are not appropriately up-regulated, and expression of glucokinase, an enzyme required for glycolysis, is not suppressed. Corticosterone has attenuated effects on expression of these enzymes in cultured mutant primary hepatocytes. Mutant mice have increased sensitivity to insulin, as assessed by homeostatic model assessment values and by increased glucose uptake by the muscle. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is also abnormal. Circulating ACTH, deoxycorticosterone, and corticosterone levels are increased in mutant animals, suggesting decreased negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Comparison with other animal models of adrenal insufficiency suggests that many of the observed abnormalities can be explained by blunted intracellular corticosterone actions, despite elevated circulating levels of this hormone.","http://academic.oup.com/endo/article-pdf/148/10/5072/10727141/endo5072.pdf",""

Referred patients were blind to the hypothesis and watched video sequences of a sitting or standing physician breaking bad news to a cancer patient and 168 of 173 participants (88 female) completed the study. Sitting physicians were preferred and viewed as significantly more compassionate than standing physicians (P < 0.0001) but other physician attributes and behaviours were generally rated as of equal or more importance than posture. In summary, cancer patients, especially females, prefer physicians to sit when breaking bad news and rate physicians who adopt this posture as more compassionate.

Here we assessed the effects of CDDO on CCAAT enhancer–binding protein alpha (CEBPA), a transcription factor critical for granulocytic differentiation. In HL60 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, CDDO (0.01 to 2 μM) induces apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, subapoptotic doses of CDDO promote phagocytic activity and granulocytic-monocytic differentiation of HL60 cells through increased de novo synthesis of p42 CEBPA protein. CEBPA translational up-regulation is required for CDDO-induced granulocytic differentiation and depends on the integrity of the CEBPA upstream open reading frame (uORF). Moreover, CDDO increases the ratio of transcriptionally active p42 and the inactive p30 CEBPA isoform, which, in turn, leads to transcriptional activation of CEBPA-regulated genes (eg, GSCFR) and is associated with dephosphorylation of eIF2α and phosphorylation of eIF4E. In concordance with these results, CDDO induces a CEBPA ratio change and differentiation of primary blasts from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Because AML is characterized by arrested differentiation, our data suggest the inclusion of CDDO in the therapy of AML characterized by dysfunctional CEBPA expression.","http://ashpublications.org/blood/article-pdf/110/10/3695/1290529/zh802207003695.pdf",""

To systematically discover ovarian fertility genes en masse, we employed a mouse model (Foxo3) in which follicles are assembled normally but then undergo synchronous activation. We developed a microarray-based approach for the systematic discovery of tissue-specific genes and, by applying it to Foxo3 ovaries and other samples, defined a surprisingly large set of ovarian factors (n = 348, ∼1% of the mouse genome). This set included the vast majority of known ovarian factors, 44% of which when mutated produce female sterility phenotypes, but most were novel. Comparative profiling of other tissues, including microdissected oocytes and somatic cells, revealed distinct gene classes and provided new insights into oogenesis and ovarian function, demonstrating the utility of our approach for tissue-specific gene discovery.

During the course of these experiments, new techniques and instrumentation were introduced and perfected for both gravity and position measurements. Gravity stations are located using high-precision global positioning system (GPS) techniques without permanent monuments. Robust methods for meter drift control have improved noise resistance in relative gravimeter surveys. Absolute gravity measurements with a field-portable instrument maintain absolute gravity levels among surveys. A 4D gravity-difference noise of [Formula: see text] standard deviation has been established at Prudhoe Bay for GPS-controlled relative gravimeter surveys. The lessons learned are now being applied to full-scale waterflood monitoring at Prudhoe Bay.

Minimal residual tumour cellularity (5 per cent or less of tumour area composed of invasive tumour cells) may be associated with an increased risk of false-negative intraoperative margins. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of minimal residual tumour cellularity after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and its impact on the frequency of false-negative margins and conversion from breast-conserving surgery to mastectomy. Methods: The final pathology slides of 510 patients who had surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were reviewed. Results: Of 396 patients with residual invasive breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 100 specimens (25·3 per cent) had minimal residual cellularity; this was more frequent in patients with invasive lobular carcinoma (17·0 versus 5·1 per cent; P &lt; 0·001) or well and moderately differentiated carcinoma (68·0 versus 52·4 per cent; P = 0·007). Among 149 patients who had initial breast-conserving surgery, false-negative intraoperative margin rates were 23 per cent in specimens with minimal and 13·8 per cent in those with higher residual cellularity (P = 0·210). There was no significant difference in the rate of conversion to mastectomy between the groups. Conclusion: Minimal residual cellularity after neoadjuvant chemotherapy occurred in about 25 per cent of specimens, but did not alter the rate of false-negative intraoperative margins.","http://academic.oup.com/bjs/article-pdf/95/4/433/36711978/bjs6044.pdf",""

The results of a 50-state survey of state immunization program officials suggest that coalitions between state immunization programs and institutions of the public and private sectors are common. Moreover, most state program officials think that the more extensive use of immunization coalitions is important for improving state immunization coverage.

The purpose of this study was to determine the relative importance of two isoforms of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in tumor vessel expansion and recruitment of bone marrow–derived cells during tumor growth. We injected VEGF165-siRNA–transfected cells (TCsi/7-1), control siRNA–transfected cells (TC/si-control), or TC71 parental Ewing's sarcoma cells into nude mice. The TCsi/7-1 tumors were then treated with adenoviral vectors expressing VEGF165 (Ad-VEGF165), VEGF189 (Ad-VEGF189), or β-galactosidase (Ad-β-gal). Bone marrow cells labeled with fluorescent tracker dye were injected into the mice 3 weeks later. The TCsi/7-1 tumors were significantly smaller (P &lt; 0.05), had decreased vessel density, and showed significantly lower bone marrow cell migration than did TC71 parental and TC/si-control tumors. Treatment with Ad-VEGF165, but not Ad-VEGF189 or Ad-β-gal, resulted in a significant increase in bone marrow cell infiltration, tumor vessel density, and tumor growth. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that the injected bone marrow cells migrated to and incorporated into the expanding CD31+ tumor vessel network. Taken together, these data show that VEGF165 is a chemoattractant that recruits bone marrow cells into the tumor area.

Concern exists that increased tunnel widening can lead to delayed graft incorporation, graft laxity, or difficulties in revision surgery. Hypothesis: Supplemental aperture fixation with autogenous bone cores or bioabsorbable interference screws will decrease tibial tunnel widening in hamstring anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: One hundred twenty-nine patients were divided into 3 groups based on type of aperture fixation: none, bioabsorbable interference screws, and autogenous bone cores. Tibial tunnel diameters were measured on plain radiographs at a minimum of 3 months postoperatively based on the timeline of tibial tunnel widening suggested by Simonian et al, and tunnel widening was quantified by the increase in tunnel diameters relative to initial reamer size. Results: Means for tunnel widening based on both anteroposterior and lateral maximum tunnel width measures were significantly different between the 3 groups (P < .05, 1-way analysis of variances); however, compared with the means for the group receiving no aperture supplementation, the means for the group receiving bioabsorbable interference screws were more than 0.8 mm wider, representing a significant increase (P < .05, Bonferroni-adjusted t tests), while the means for the group receiving autogenous bone cores were less than 0.6 mm wider than the group without aperture supplementation and not significantly different (P > .25, Bonferroni-adjusted t tests). Conclusion: Tibial tunnel aperture supplementation does not appear to decrease tunnel widening in hamstring anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and may actually increase the amount of tibial tunnel widening.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0363546507304716",""

To systematically discover ovarian fertility genes en masse, we employed a mouse model (Foxo3) in which follicles are assembled normally but then undergo synchronous activation. We developed a microarray-based approach for the systematic discovery of tissue-specific genes and, by applying it to Foxo3 ovaries and other samples, defined a surprisingly large set of ovarian factors (n = 348, ∼1% of the mouse genome). This set included the vast majority of known ovarian factors, 44% of which when mutated produce female sterility phenotypes, but most were novel. Comparative profiling of other tissues, including microdissected oocytes and somatic cells, revealed distinct gene classes and provided new insights into oogenesis and ovarian function, demonstrating the utility of our approach for tissue-specific gene discovery. This study will thus facilitate comprehensive analyses of follicle development, ovarian function, and female infertility.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/177/1/179/46759548/genetics0179.pdf",""

J. Campbell, Phys. Plasmas 8, 2041 (2001)]. Such enormous values of necessary frad could have serious and debilitating consequences on the core confinement, stability, and dependability for a fusion power reactor, especially in reactors with Internal Transport Barriers. A new class of divertors, called X-divertors (XD), which considerably enhance the divertor thermal capacity through a flaring of the field lines only near the divertor plates, may be necessary and sufficient to overcome these problems and lead to a dependable fusion power reactor with acceptable economics. X-divertors will lower the bar on the necessary confinement to bring it in the range of the present experimental results. Its ability to reduce the radiative burden imparts the X-divertor with a key advantage. Lower radiation demands allow sharply peaked density profiles that enhance the bootstrap fraction creating the possibility for a highly increased beta for the same beta normal discharges. The X-divertor emerges as a beta-enhancer capable of raising it by up to roughly a factor of 2.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pop/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.2739422/14012305/072502_1_online.pdf",""

We examined the effects of Pavlovian conditioning on reproductive fitness in a sperm-competition situation. Typically, two males mating with the same female in immediate succession sire similar numbers of offspring. In a study with domesticated quail (Coturnix japonica), we increased paternity success by presenting a Pavlovian signal that permitted one of two competing males to predict copulatory opportunity. Using microsatellite-based DNA fingerprinting, we found that signaled males sired 72% of the offspring when competing with control males, and this effect was independent of copulation order. In the absence of Pavlovian conditioning, rates of fertilization were not significantly different for two males that copulated with the same female. These findings demonstrate that Pavlovian conditioning contributes to reproductive fitness and suggest that individual past experience can bias genetic transmission and the evolutionary changes that result from sexual competition.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01974.x",""

Sensitivities of reflection coefficients to each bulk elastic parameter are computed as the partial derivatives of the seismic reflectivities, relative to each parameter. The sensitivity of reflectivity to gas saturation is then calculated as the full derivative of the reflectivities with respect to gas saturation, assuming both a homogeneous and a patchy distribution of gas in the pore fluids. We compute sensitivities for a sealing shale/gas-sand interface and a gas-sand/wet-sand (gas-water contact, GWC) interface. For the SH-SH reflectivity, the effect of density contrast is strongest in the 30°–50° range of incidence angles for the fluid-fluid interface and at nearer offsets for the shale/gas-sand interface. P-SV reflectivity forthe fluid-fluid interfaces is more sensitive to density contrast in the range of angles of incidence from 30° to 60°. The overall response of P-SV reflectivity to gas saturation throughout all offsets is dominated by the Poisson’s ratio of the gas sand. In the case of P-P reflectivity, the sensitivity to gas saturation increases with increasing incidence angles. The sensitivity of P-SV reflectivity to gas saturation tends to be greatest in the 20°–40° range of incidence angles. For SH-SH reflectivity, the sensitivity to gas saturation for most offsets is controlled mainly by the density contrast, and the sensitivity to density decreases with increasing offset. There is still not a generally accepted seismic reflection method to discriminate commercial gas concentrations from low gas saturation. From the sensitivity analysis, we conclude that the use of P-SV or SH-SH amplitude variation with offset (AVO), integrated with the P-P AVO, will be an essential element in understanding this problem fully.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/1.2437121",""

This compound and its hydrolysis product glycyrrhetinic acid have been associated with the multiple therapeutic properties of licorice extracts. We have investigated the effects of 2-cyano substituted analogues of glycyrrhetinic acid on their cytotoxicities and activity as selective peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ (PPARγ) agonists. Methyl 2-cyano-3,11-dioxo-18β-olean-1,12-dien-30-oate (β-CDODA-Me) and methyl 2-cyano-3,11-dioxo-18α-olean-1,12-dien-30-oate (α-CDODA-Me) were more cytotoxic to colon cancer cells than their des-cyano analogues and introduction of the 2-cyano group into the pentacyclic ring system was necessary for the PPARγ agonist activity of α-CDODA-Me and β-CDODA-Me isomers. However, in mammalian two-hybrid assays, both compounds differentially induced interactions of PPARγ with coactivators, suggesting that these isomers, which differ only in the stereochemistry at C18 which affects conformation of the E-ring, are selective receptor modulators. This selectivity in colon cancer cells was shown for the induction of two proapoptotic proteins, namely caveolin-1 and the tumor-suppressor gene Krüppel-like factor-4 (KLF-4). β-CDODA-Me but not α-CDODA-Me induced caveolin-1 in SW480 colon cancer cells, whereas caveolin-1 was induced by both compounds in HT-29 and HCT-15 colon cancer cells. The CDODA-Me isomers induced KLF-4 mRNA levels in HT-29 and SW480 cells but had minimal effects on KLF-4 expression in HCT-15 cells. These induced responses were inhibited by cotreatment with a PPARγ antagonist. This shows for the first time that PPARγ agonists derived from glycyrrhetinic acid induced cell-dependent caveolin-1 and KLF-4 expression through receptor-dependent pathways.

However, EMTs exhibit limitations that substantially restrict their validity for petrophysical interpretation. For instance, pore connectivity is of significant interest in the study of subsurface reservoirs, but no existing EMT includes it as an explicit property in the analysis of kilohertz- to gigahertz-range dielectric measurements. We introduce a new approach to quantify the effects of pore geometry and connectivity on the kilohertz-gigahertz frequency dispersion of dielectric permittivity and electrical conductivity of clay-free porous rocks. This approach is based on the numerical solution of the internal electric fields within submicron-resolution pore maps constructed with grain and rock pixels. The discrepancy between the internal fields and electrical currents calculated for ahomogeneous scatterer and those calculated for a given pore map is minimized to yield the effective electrical conductivity and dielectric constant for that pore map. This minimization is performed independently for each frequency and is verified to agree implicitly with Kramers-Kronig's causality relationships. We show that EMTs only predict an average dispersion for given microscopic geometrical parameters (e.g., porosity, pore eccentricity), whereas individual realizations honoring the same parameters are associated with dispersion about average values predicted by EMTs. Unlike any EMT prediction, we show that pore connectivity plays a major role in both the shape and amplitude of wide-band electromagnetic property dispersions. The simulation procedure introduced in this paper provides a systematic method to assess the sensitivity of a multitude of pore-scale properties on the macroscopic wide-band dielectric dispersion of saturated rocks.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/1.2561301",""

The use of getters such as sputtered Ti and Ba to maintain a moisture free environment within the MEMS package has been proposed and is well documented. Though getters ensure a moisture free environment within the package, they do not ensure hermeticity over long periods of time. Hermetic packaging is sometimes desirable for MEMS and optical MEMS (especially those that require long shelf lives) in order to guarantee operational reliability. This paper presents a hermetic fluxless die and wafer-level sealing process with adequate bond strength, assessed using the MIL-STD-883E standard. The hermetic sealing process is achieved via 80%Au-20%Sn eutectic solder rectangular seal rings deposited around the top die perimeter via evaporation and sputtering. We chose 80%Au-20%Sn eutectic solder for sealing because of its high resistance to surface oxide film formation as a result of its high gold content thereby eliminating the use of organic materials such as flux, and at the same time, providing hermetic seal at the die bond interface. The paper also discusses the use of linear regression analysis in packaging process development for our devices. The focus here is identifying process variables that significantly affect the process using as few packaged MEMS samples as available for reliability testing due to their high cost. The process parameters investigated in this paper apply to the shear strength of the resulting die stack, and include the applied bonding pressure, the maximum reflow temperature and the dwell time at the maximum reflow temperature. Conclusions are drawn based on experimental measurements conducted at the Texas Microfactory™ at UT Arlington, and at the Bennington Microtechnology Center (BMC) in Vermont, USA.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/InterPACK/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/IPACK2007-33850/2666584/67_1.pdf",""

The purpose of this study was to determine the relative importance of two isoforms of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in tumor vessel expansion and recruitment of bone marrow–derived cells during tumor growth. We injected VEGF165-siRNA–transfected cells (TCsi/7-1), control siRNA–transfected cells (TC/si-control), or TC71 parental Ewing's sarcoma cells into nude mice. The TCsi/7-1 tumors were then treated with adenoviral vectors expressing VEGF165 (Ad-VEGF165), VEGF189 (Ad-VEGF189), or β-galactosidase (Ad-β-gal). Bone marrow cells labeled with fluorescent tracker dye were injected into the mice 3 weeks later. The TCsi/7-1 tumors were significantly smaller (P &lt; 0.05), had decreased vessel density, and showed significantly lower bone marrow cell migration than did TC71 parental and TC/si-control tumors. Treatment with Ad-VEGF165, but not Ad-VEGF189 or Ad-β-gal, resulted in a significant increase in bone marrow cell infiltration, tumor vessel density, and tumor growth. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that the injected bone marrow cells migrated to and incorporated into the expanding CD31+ tumor vessel network. Taken together, these data show that VEGF165 is a chemoattractant that recruits bone marrow cells into the tumor area. These data provide a mechanism by which Ewing's sarcoma cells induce vasculogenesis. (Mol Cancer Res 2007;5(11):1125–32)","https://aacrjournals.org/mcr/article-pdf/5/11/1125/3140348/1125.pdf",""

A number of diseases, including cancer, show a strong correlation between integrin activation and metastasis.

While a number of computational models and experimental studies have addressed the issue of cell adhesion to surfaces, no model or theory has adequately addressed cell adhesion at the molecular level. In this paper, the authors present a thermodynamic model that addresses receptor-mediated cell adhesion at the molecular level. By incorporating the entropic, conformational, solvation, and long- and short-range interactive components of receptors and the extracellular matrix molecules, they are able to predict adhesive free energy as a function of a number of key variables such as surface coverage, interaction distance, molecule size, and solvent conditions. Their method allows them to compute the free energy of adhesion in a multicomponent system where they can simultaneously study adhesion receptors and ligands of different sizes, chemical identities, and conformational properties. The authors’ results not only provide a fundamental understanding of adhesion at the molecular level but also suggest possible strategies for designing novel biomaterials.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.2424985/15391837/045103_1_online.pdf",""

Because RALBP1 transports anthracycline and Vinca alkaloid drugs, as well as GS-E, and because it confers resistance to these drugs, we proposed that depletion or inhibition of RALBP1 should cause regression of human solid tumors that overexpress RALBP1 and augment chemotherapy efficacy. Non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) H358 and H520 and colon SW480 cell lines were used. Cytotoxic synergy between anti-RALBP1 immunoglobulin G (IgG), cis-diammine-dichloroplatinum (II) [CDDP], and vinorelbine was examined in cell culture and xenografts of NSCLC cells. Effects of RALBP1 depletion by antisense were examined in xenografts of NSCLC H358, NSCLC H520, and colon SW480 cells. RALBP1 depletion by phosphorothioate antisense was confirmed and was associated with rapid, complete, and sustained remissions in established s.c. human lung and colon xenografts. RALBP1 inhibition by anti-RALBP1 IgG was equally as effective as antisense and enhanced CDDP-vinorelbine in lung cancer xenografts. These studies show that RALBP1 is a transporter that serves as a key effector function in cancer cell survival and is a valid target for cancer therapy, and confirm that inhibitory modulation of RALBP1 transport activity at the cell surface is sufficient for antitumor effects.

Novel findings have shown that telomerase activation in normal human epithelial cells may affect expression of several cancer-related genes, such as growth-related genes and c-myc gene, suggesting a possible role of telomerase in tumor initiation. Therefore, we hypothesized that individuals who are sensitive to mutagen challenge in terms of induced telomerase activity might have increased cancer risk. We tested this hypothesis in a bladder cancer case-control study (51 cases and 51 matched controls) by measuring baseline and γ-radiation–induced telomerase activities in peripheral blood lymphocytes. We found a significantly higher γ-radiation–induced telomerase activity in bladder cancer cases compared with the controls (1.34 versus 1.23; P = 0.044). A similar finding was also observed using the normalized telomerase activity (ratio of γ-radiation induced versus baseline; 1.49 versus 1.19; P &lt; 0.001). In further categorizing the telomerase activity using 75% of the normalized value in the controls as a cutoff point, we found a significantly increased risk for bladder cancer associated with higher induced telomerase activity (adjusted odds ratio, 3.62; 95% confidence interval, 1.38-9.51). In quartile analysis, a dose-response association was noted between the induced telomerase activity and increased bladder cancer risk (Ptrend = 0.005). Our findings provide the first evidence linking the mutagen-induced telomerase activity in peripheral blood lymphocytes to the risk of bladder cancer, which warrants further investigation in large-sized studies and other cancer types.

Tantalum profiles were evaluated using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth profiling, back side secondary ion mass spectroscopy, and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. A 3.9nm boron carbonitride film sealed PMSQ, which has an average pore diameter of 1.9nm before etching. The diffuse nature of the BC0.9N0.07-PMSQ interface in electron energy loss profile maps suggests that some of the BC0.9N0.07 penetrates into the PMSQ until the pore openings are pinched off as the sealing film deposits.","https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jva/article-pdf/25/3/570/16122596/570_1_online.pdf",""

Here, we examined the recruitment of DC to the lung in the context of two human paramyxovirus infections: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Recruitment of DC to the lung in infected mice was determined by flow cytometry. Both infections induced a peak of cDC recruitment (&gt;3×106) by day 8 for RSV and by day 10 for hMPV. cDC remained elevated throughout the inflammatory and the resolution phases of infection (1×106) compared to control (1×105). RSV induced a peak of 8×105 pDC recruited by day 3, while hMPV induced similar numbers but at day 8. pDC returned to basal levels (1×105) by day 6 (RSV) and by day 12 (hMPV). IKDC mirrored the pattern of migration of pDC but overall numbers of IKDC were smaller: peak for RSV was 5×105 IKDC and &lt;4×105 IKDC for hMPV. Furthermore, depletion of pDC with anti-mPDCA1 antibody resulted in significant increases in peak titers and pulmonary inflammation in RSV and hMPV infected mice. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that all three subsets of DC are attracted to the site of infection in the course of paramyxovirus infections and pDC play a critical role in viral replication and pathogenesis.","https://journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article/178/1_Supplement/S49/79860/Trafficking-of-dendritic-cell-subsets-to-the-lung",""

Numerous epidemiologic studies have suggested that mutagen sensitivity is a cancer susceptibility factor for a variety of epithelial cancers. A recent classic twin study examined systematically the role of genetic and environmental factors on the mutagen sensitivity phenotype and provided compelling evidence that mutagen sensitivity is highly heritable. A new prospective analysis provides further support to the notion that mutagen sensitivity increases the risk of cancer. In this review, we briefly summarize nearly two decades of epidemiologic and genetic studies linking mutagen sensitivity and cancer risk. The evidence is becoming increasingly convincing that mutagen sensitivity is a risk factor for cancer development.

This analysis approach relies on a triple-continuum concept, using observed geological data from carbonate oil formations in western China, to describe transient flow behavior in fracture-vug-matrix reservoirs. In the conceptual mathematical model, fractured vuggy rock is considered as a triple-continuum medium, consisting of fractures, rock matrix, and vugs (or cavities). Similar to the classical double-porosity model, the fracture continuum is assumed to be responsible for the occurrence of global flow, while vuggy and matrix continua (providing primary storage space) interact locally with each other as well as with globally connected fractures. Furthermore, the triple continua of fractures, matrix, and vugs are assumed to have uniform and homogeneous properties throughout, and intercontinuum flows between them are at pseudosteady state. With these assumptions, we derive analytical solutions in Laplace space for transient flow toward a well in an infinite and finite reservoir with wellbore storage and skin effects. The analytical solutions reveal typical pressure responses in a fracture-vug-matrix reservoir and can be used for estimating vug properties, in addition to fracture and matrix parameters, through properly designed and conducted well tests. As application examples, actual well test data from a fractured-vuggy reservoir in Western China are analyzed using the triple continuum model.","https://onepetro.org/SPEATCE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/110044-MS/2762773/spe-110044-ms.pdf",""

In this study, we used BK5.erbB2 transgenic mice as an animal model to examine the therapeutic effect of rapamycin as a potential treatment for gallbladder cancer. Homozygous BK5.erbB2 mice overexpressing the wild-type rat erbB2 gene in basal epithelial cells of the gallbladder have an ∼70% incidence of gallbladder adenocarcinoma by 2 to 3 months of age. Groups of mice (∼2–3 months of age) were treated with rapamycin by i.p. injection (once daily for 14 days) and then sacrificed 24 h after the last treatment. Rapamycin significantly reduced the incidence and severity of gallbladder carcinoma in BK5.erbB2 mice in a dose-dependent manner. Tumors responsive to treatment exhibited a higher number of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, rapamycin treatment led to decreased levels of phosphorylated p70 S6 kinase (Thr389) in gallbladder tissue as assessed by both Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses. Finally, immunofluorescence staining revealed elevated phosphorylated Akt (Ser473) and phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR; Ser2448) in human gallbladder cancer compared with normal gallbladder tissue. Based on our results using a novel genetically engineered mouse model and the fact that the Akt/mTOR pathway is activated in human gallbladder cancer, rapamycin and related drugs may be effective therapeutic agents for the treatment of human gallbladder cancer.

As a result, the PL focuses a subwavelength spot in the midfield, i.e., the focal length is several microns. The authors experiment demonstrated that 90–300 nm spots (up to λ∕4) with pitches of 400–500 nm, focal length of 1.7 μm, were printed by a PL using 405 nm laser. The authors three-dimensional electromagnetic simulation predicted a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 210 nm, equivalent to an aberration-free lens having an unity numerical aperture (NA=1).

Although the overall incidence of breast cancer among African-American (AA) women is lower than in white American women, this cancer is more common in young premenopausal AA women, and AA breast cancer patients of all ages are more likely to have advanced disease at diagnosis, higher risk of recurrence, and poorer overall prognosis. Epidemiological studies indicate that these differences may be attributable in part to variation in obesity and body fat distribution. Additionally, AA women more frequently exhibit breast cancer with an aggressive and metastatic phenotype that may also be attributable to the endocrine and metabolic changes associated with upper body obesity. These changes include both elevated estrogen and androgen bioactivity, hyperinsulinemia, and perturbations of the adipokines. Type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome, which are more common in AA women, have also been associated with breast cancer risk. Moreover, each of the individual components of the syndrome has been associated with increased breast cancer risk, including low levels of the adipocytokine, adiponectin. This review explores the specific roles of obesity, body fat distribution (particularly visceral and sc adipose tissue), type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and adipocytokines in explaining the differential patterns of breast cancer risk and prognosis between AA and white American women.","http://academic.oup.com/edrv/article-pdf/28/7/763/8862474/edrv0763.pdf",""

The purpose of the PCMS is to convey information about upcoming traffic situations. Results indicate the need to keep messages at or below the four-unit maximum recommended in existing guidelines. It was found that presenting five units of information on sequential PCMS resulted in low comprehension rates, below what would be acceptable for highway applications. However, by keeping the message length to four units, it appears that the use of the sequential PCMS will result in comprehension rates comparable with those obtained by presenting the same information at a single location on a large dynamic message sign. Comprehension may be enhanced by repeating one line of the message on both PCMS used in a given sequence.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/2015-04",""

To test this hypothesis, we studied genetic polymorphisms in the inflammation pathway in relation to lung cancer risk. We evaluated a panel of 59 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 37 inflammation-related genes among non-Hispanic Caucasian lung cancer cases (N = 1,553) and controls (N = 1,730) from Houston, Texas. Logistic regression was used to assess associations with lung cancer under a dominant genetic model adjusted for sex, age, and smoking. Haplotypes were estimated with the expectation-maximization algorithm. False-positive report probabilities (FPRP) were calculated for significant associations. Interleukin 1β (IL1B) C3954T was associated with lung cancer [odds ratio (OR), 1.27; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.10–1.47; FPRP 0.148]. Two IL1A SNPs (C-889T and Ala114Ser) were also related to lung cancer (OR, 1.18–1.22), although FPRPs were higher. One IL1A-IL1B haplotype, containing only the IL1B 3954T allele, was associated with elevated lung cancer risk (OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.24–2.61). These associations were stronger in heavy smokers, particularly for IL1B C3954T (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.28–1.97; FPRP 0.004). Lung cancer risk was unrelated to polymorphisms in IL1 receptor or antagonist genes. Associations with lung cancer were also seen for SNPs in granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor and peroxisome proliferator-activated factor-δ, but FPRPs were high. IL1A and IL1B polymorphisms are associated with increased lung cancer risk, especially among heavy smokers. IL1A and IL1B are critical signals in initiating inflammation. Our results suggest that a dysregulated inflammatory response to tobacco-induced lung damage promotes carcinogenesis.

Here, we examined the recruitment of DC to the lung in the context of two human paramyxovirus infections: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Recruitment of DC to the lung in infected mice was determined by flow cytometry. Both infections induced a peak of cDC recruitment (&gt;3×106) by day 8 for RSV and by day 10 for hMPV. cDC remained elevated throughout the inflammatory and the resolution phases of infection (1×106) compared to control (1×105). RSV induced a peak of 8×105 pDC recruited by day 3, while hMPV induced similar numbers but at day 8. pDC returned to basal levels (1×105) by day 6 (RSV) and by day 12 (hMPV). IKDC mirrored the pattern of migration of pDC but overall numbers of IKDC were smaller: peak for RSV was 5×105 IKDC and &lt;4×105 IKDC for hMPV. Furthermore, depletion of pDC with anti-mPDCA1 antibody resulted in significant increases in peak titers and pulmonary inflammation in RSV and hMPV infected mice. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that all three subsets of DC are attracted to the site of infection in the course of paramyxovirus infections and pDC play a critical role in viral replication and pathogenesis.","https://journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article/178/1_Supplement/S49/79860/Trafficking-of-dendritic-cell-subsets-to-the-lung",""

Our procedure uses a proton beam that is collimated by a circular aperture at its central axis and is then intercepted by a small steel sphere rigidly supported by the patient couch. A laser tracker measurement system and a correction algorithm for couch position assures precise positioning of the steel sphere at the mechanical isocenter of the gantry. A film‐based radiation dosimetry technique, chosen for the good spatial resolution it achieves, records the proton dose distribution for optical image analysis. The optical image obtained presents a circular high‐dose region surrounding a lower‐dose area corresponding to the proton beam absorption by the steel sphere, thereby providing a measure of the beam alignment with the mechanical isocenter.

We generated a breast cancer Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) high-resolution database of ∼2.7 million tags to perform unsupervised statistical analyses to obtain the molecular classification of breast-invasive ductal carcinomas in correlation with clinicopathologic features. Unsupervised statistical analysis by means of a random forest approach identified two main clusters of breast carcinomas, which differed in their lymph node status (P = 0.01); this suggested that lymph node status leads to globally distinct expression profiles. A total of 245 (55 up-modulated and 190 down-modulated) transcripts were differentially expressed between lymph node (+) and lymph node (−) primary breast tumors (fold change, ≥2; P &lt; 0.05). Various lymph node (+) up-modulated transcripts were validated in independent sets of human breast tumors by means of real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). We validated significant overexpression of transcripts for HOXC10 (P = 0.001), TPD52L1 (P = 0.007), ZFP36L1 (P = 0.011), PLINP1 (P = 0.013), DCTN3 (P = 0.025), DEK (P = 0.031), and CSNK1D (P = 0.04) in lymph node (+) breast carcinomas. Moreover, the DCTN3 (P = 0.022) and RHBDD2 (P = 0.002) transcripts were confirmed to be overexpressed in tumors that recurred within 6 years of follow-up by real-time RT-PCR. In addition, meta-analysis was used to compare SAGE data associated with lymph node (+) status with publicly available breast cancer DNA microarray data sets. We have generated evidence indicating that the pattern of gene expression in primary breast cancers at the time of surgical removal could discriminate those tumors with lymph node metastatic involvement using SAGE to identify specific transcripts that behave as predictors of recurrence as well.

A newly-developed Distributed Volumetric Sources (DVS) method was used to calculate dimensionless productivity index for a defined source in a box-shaped domain. The unique features of the DVS method are that method can be applied to both transient flow and pseudo-steady state flow with a smooth transition between the boundary conditions. By describing the geometric dimensions of the sources, productivity index for a horizontal gas well or a longitudinal fracture along a horizontal well is readily calculated. For transverse fractures with infinite conductivity or uniform flux, the superposition principle is used for multiple sources in the system.

The time domain simulations are performed by using an unsteady, overset-grid (Chimera), Navier-Stokes method. The studied riser is a top tensioned riser in 3,000ft water depth. The fluid domain was descritized to a total of slightly less than 1 million elements. The calculation was performed in time domain. At each time step, the drag and lift forces are computed by solving Navier-Stokes equations. The turbulence flow was solved using Large Eddy Simulation (LES) with Smagorinsky subgrid-scale turbulence model. The instantaneous drag and lift forces along the riser are then applied to riser motion equations. We developed a simplified riser motion solver based on tensioned beam equation and modal decomposition. The motion solver is embedded in the CFD codes, so the calculated riser velocities and displacements are feed back to the fluid domain computation at each time step. Both in-line and cross flow VIV are calculated, but we focus only on the cross flow VIV in this paper. We studied the 3D flow pattern around the riser, riser response and modal excitation, and riser stress distribution that could be used for further fatigue assessment.","http://onepetro.org/OTCONF/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.4043/18769-MS/1833444/otc-18769-ms.pdf",""

The sample included 4,183 men and 6,708 women aged 60 years and older from seven cities. The outcomes are mammogram and Pap smear use in women and prostate examination use in men within the last 2 years. Results: In general, illiterate or lower-educated older men and women have the lowest rates of cancer screening use compared with higher-educated counterparts. Multivariate logistic models, by city and in a combined sample of six cities showed that high education is associated with higher odds of having a mammogram or a Pap smear in women and a prostate examination in men. Conclusions: Older adults with low educational or literacy levels should be targeted for screening programs in these populations.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/107327480701400409",""

This is particularly important for muscles crossing multiple joints. However, because of the nature of the soft tissue anatomy that defines the paths of the intrinsic muscles of the hand inserting into the extensor hood (also known as the dorsal expansion), this assumption may not be true for the intrinsic muscle moment arms at the Proximal Interphalangeal (PIP) Joint. These are muscles that insert into the “hood” of the dorsal expansion at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint of the fingers acting as flexors at the MCP joint and extensors at the PIP joint. The gliding and flexible nature of these tissues bring into question the validity of the assumption that the extension moment arm of the intrinsic muscles at the PIP joint are independent of the position of the MCP joint. Indeed the fact that some of the intrinsic muscles exhibit an increasing (bowstringing) moment arm at the MCP joint with increased flexion infers that the paths of muscles acting through the dorsal expansion do change with respect to phalanx rotation. Does this changing path then affect the extension moment arm of the intrinsics acting at the PIP joint? This project investigates this question with the hypothesis that the extension moment arms of the second lumbrical (2Lum), the second and third dorsal interosseous (2DI and 3DI) at the middle finger PIP joint are significantly different with the middle MCP joint flexed, neutral (at extension) and hyperextended.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/SBC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/SBC2007-176554/4209494/653_1.pdf",""

This endeavor is sought through a series of three experiments focusing on understanding the influence of representation on the design-by-analogy process. The first two experiments evaluate the effects of analogous product description—presented in either domain-general or domain-specific language—on a designer’s ability to later use the product to solve a novel design problem. Six different design problems with corresponding analogous products are evaluated. The third experiment in the series uses a factorial design to explore the effects of the representation (domain specific or general sentinel descriptions) for both the design problem and the analogous product on the designer’s ability to develop solutions to novel design problems. Results show that a more general representation of the analogous products facilitates later use for a novel design problem. The highest rates of success occur when design problems are presented in domain specific representations and the analogous product is in a domain general representation. Other insights for the development of design by analogy methods and tools are also discussed.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/DETC2007-34948/4526225/145_1.pdf",""

The muscle contractions were generated unilaterally by electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve in anesthetized animals. The technique was developed by muscle biologists as a way of simulating resistive exercise, and it was used in the current research as a countermeasure for rats undergoing hindlimb unloading to simulate musculoskeletal effects of space flight. The intensity of muscle contraction is quantified by measuring the torque generated at the ankle joint. A wide range of torques can be generated by varying the frequency of the electrical stimulating signal. Three specific questions were addressed in the current study. First, what is the relationship between strain and torque? Second, does the relationship between strain and torque change during the period of hindlimb unloading with exercise? Third, are the strain magnitudes in the range generally regarded to be osteogenic? This project is part of a larger effort aimed at assessing the efficacy of the muscle stimulation method as a countermeasure for the negative musculoskeletal effects of mechanical unloading.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/SBC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/SBC2007-176343/4208461/909_1.pdf",""
