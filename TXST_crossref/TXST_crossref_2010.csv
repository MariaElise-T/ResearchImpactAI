Maximization, conscientiousness, and perceptions of distributive justice are examined using multiple regression analysis. Maximizers are far more likely to engage in both kiasu positive and kiasu negative tactics than are satisficers. When people perceive that outputs are distributed fairly, they are more likely to engage in kiasu positive tactics.

In this context, online marketplaces for manufacturing services have become attractive venues for rapid development of supply chain relationships. Despite their numerous benefits, the existing online markets have failed in adequately automating the supply chain deployment process. Heavy reliance of the existing online markets on human agents for formulating supplier queries and evaluating the obtained results can be mainly attributed to the informal nature of the information models used in these markets. To enable active involvement of machine agents in supply chain deployment, the underlying information models that support online markets should represent the semantics of information in a formal and machine-interpretable fashion. This paper introduces Manufacturing Service Description Language (MSDL) as a formal ontology for description of suppliers’ capability at different levels of abstraction including process-level, machine-level, and system level. Also, an agent-based framework is proposed in this paper that facilitates automated discovery and evaluation of potential manufacturing partners based on the MSDL description of the services they provide.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/DETC2010-28179/4534308/435_1.pdf",""

The use of treeline as a proxy for climate change has been assessed in parks throughout the west but often at the expense of geology or geomorphology as controls of treeline variation. The dissimilar geology and geomorphic processes of the western national parks suggest that treeline may respond differently between national parks when subjected to disturbance. Therefore, predicted vegetation response to disturbance across the western USA may provide a limited assessment of change beyond fine-scale analysis due to data collection from a limited number of national parks containing alpine treeline. We performed a content analysis on previous research that examined alpine treeline in national parks and classified each treeline study as anthropogenic, orographic/edaphic, or climatic according to the primary factor attributed to treeline control. Results indicated that the three types of treeline are not uniformly studied. Climatic treeline is most commonly studied whereas anthropogenic and orographic/edaphic studies are often lacking. Furthermore, several western national parks are entirely devoid of anthropogenic and orographic treeline research. Similar findings exist for treeline studies in protected places worldwide.

The method involves a single extraction step followed by centrifugation and filtration before analysis by ultra-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization (UPLC/ESI)-MS/MS. The LC/MS/MS method developed here represents the fastest and simplest procedure (&lt;30 min) among both conventional HPLC methods and other LC/MS methods using SPE cleanup. The potential for high throughput analysis makes the method particularly beneficial for regulatory agencies and analytical laboratories with a high sample volume. A single-laboratory validation was conducted by testing three different spiking levels (200, 500, and 1000 ng/g for FB1 and FB2; 100, 250, and 500 ng/g for FB3) for accuracy and precision. Recoveries of FB1 ranged from 93 to 98% with RSD values of 3-8%. Recoveries of FB2 ranged from 104 to 108, with RSD values of 2-6%.

Their function is especially critical in the distal portion of nephron where Na+ and water must be reabsorbed in order to maintain appropriate blood pressure levels. Anomalous ENaC activity can lead to disorders such as Liddle's syndrome, which is due to overactive ENaC resulting in hypertension, or pseudohypoaldosteronism type I, which is caused by decreased ENaC activity resulting in hypotension. Understanding assembly and modulation of ENaC are essential to understanding its physiological role. We have previously reported the development of a quickly screen for monitoring ENaC activity, which takes advantage of ENaC's ability to transport Na+ into yeast cells and cause growth inhibition (i.e salt sensitivity phenotype). These results can easily be visually compared by using a survival pronging dilution assay. In an effort to examine critical partners in ENaC assembly and modulation, we have screened a series of Saccaromyces Genome Deletion Project strains. We report the identification of four genes required for proper ENaC function in yeast: SUR4, ERV14, EMP24, and ERV25 as well as ULA, which showed significant reduction in growth suggesting an overly active ENaC or an increased stability of otherwise normal channels.

We obtain defect energy level resolution by exploiting the enormous difference between the capacitance of the very thin dielectric and the capacitance of the depletion layer of moderately doped silicon. The simplicity of the technique and the robust character of the response make it, at least potentially, of widespread utility in the understanding of defects important in solid state electronics. Since the specific defect observed is generated by high electric field stressing, an important device instability in present day integrated circuitry, the observations are of considerable importance for present day technology. Since the observations involve inherent high sensitivity and tunneling, and since the process can be turned on and off with the application of a narrow range of voltage, our results may also be relevant to the development of spin based quantum computing.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.3482071/13217217/064511_1_online.pdf",""

Here, we report on studies performed to understand the role of tuberborne ZC in the epidemiology of this disease. Depending on variety, up to 44% of ZC-affected seed tubers (ZCST) were viable, producing hair sprouts and weak plants. Chip discoloration in progeny tubers of ZCST was more severe than those from ZC-asymptomatic seed tubers but varied depending on whether progeny tubers or foliage were positive or negative for ‘Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum’. A low percentage of greenhouse-grown plants produced by ZCST tested positive for ‘Ca. Liberibacter’. No adult potato psyllids became infective after feeding upon these plants but they did acquire ‘Ca. Liberibacter’ from field-grown plants produced by ZCST. Plants with new ZC infections near plants produced by ZCST were not significantly different from healthy plants, whereas plants affected with ZC from infectious potato psyllids had significantly more ZC infections near either plants produced by ZCST or healthy plants. We conclude that, in areas where ZC is currently established, plants produced by ZCST do not significantly contribute to ZC incidence and spread within potato fields.","https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/pdf/10.1094/PDIS-94-6-0659",""

Although substantial evidence suggests that African American and Latino students who attend these schools face fewer learning opportunities than their White counterparts, until now, it has been impossible to examine this using a representative sample because of lack of data. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: This study uses newly available data to investigate whether racially diverse high schools offer equality of educational opportunity to students from different racial and ethnic groups. This is examined by measuring the relative representation of minority students in advanced math classes at the beginning of high school and estimating whether and how this opportunity structure limits the level of achievement attained by African American and Latino students by the end of high school. Setting: This study uses data from the Adolescent Health and Academic Achievement Study (AHAA) and its partner study, the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), a stratified, nationally representative study of students in U.S. high schools first surveyed in 1994–1995. Population/Participants/Subjects: Two samples of racially diverse high schools were used in the analysis: one with African Americans, Whites, and Asians (26 schools with 3,149 students), and the other with Latinos, Whites, and Asians (22 schools with 2,775 students). Research Design: Quantitative analyses first assess how high schools vary in the extent to which minority students are underrepresented in advanced sophomore math classes. Hierarchical multilevel modeling is then used to estimate whether racial-ethnic differences in representation in advanced math have an impact on African American and Latino students’ achievement by the end of high school, relative to the Whites and Asians in the school. Specifically, we estimate the effects of Whites’ and Asians’ overrepresentation in sophomore-year math (or Latino or African American underrepresentation) within the school on students’ senior-year grades and their postsecondary enrollment. Findings/Results: Findings show that schools vary in the extent to which African American and Latino students are underrepresented in advanced sophomore math classes. This pattern of racial inequality in schools is associated with lower minority senior-year grades and enrollment in 4-year postsecondary institutions, net of students’ own background. Conclusions/Recommendations: Evidence consistently suggests that schools can play an active role in the provision of opportunities for social mobility or in the exacerbation of social inequality, depending on how they are structured. It is important to consider racial stratification within schools as a mechanism of inequality of educational opportunity.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/016146811011200406",""

This study examines the sensitivity of the performance of the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model to the use of three different PBL schemes [Mellor–Yamada–Janjic (MYJ), Yonsei University (YSU), and the asymmetric convective model, version 2 (ACM2)]. Comparison of surface and boundary layer observations with 92 sets of daily, 36-h high-resolution WRF simulations with different schemes over Texas in July–September 2005 shows that the simulations with the YSU and ACM2 schemes give much less bias than with the MYJ scheme. Simulations with the MYJ scheme, the only local closure scheme of the three, produced the coldest and moistest biases in the PBL. The differences among the schemes are found to be due predominantly to differences in vertical mixing strength and entrainment of air from above the PBL. A sensitivity experiment with the ACM2 scheme confirms this diagnosis.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jamc/article-pdf/49/9/1831/3557450/2010jamc2432_1.pdf",""

For example, the odds that an overweight girl is engaged in weight control increase substantially when many overweight girls in her school are also trying to lose weight. This study highlights how schools play an important role in shaping girls’ decisions to practice weight control and demonstrates how social comparison theory improves our understanding of how health behaviors are linked to social contexts.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0022146509361191",""

This study examined the relationship between small-group collaborative learning structures and the potential predictors of groups' overall academic performance. We sought to identify specific factors that distinguished high-performing groups from low-performing groups in the classroom. Class attendance and individual-level academic performance were positively related to group-level academic performance. Further, it was predicted that groups consisting of an exceptionally high-performing member, or superstar, would achieve greater group-level academic performance than groups consisting of members who performed similarly. However, the greater the distance between the highest-performing member's score and the average of the other group members' scores on individual-level tasks, the lower the score on group-level tasks. This difference between the highest scoring group member and the rest of the members is referred to as the Superstar Difference Score. Qualitative and quantitative analyses indicated that the Superstar Difference Score is a reliable, negative predictor of group-level academic performance.

Methods: The “safe zone” for each level of the cervical spine was described as an area where the surgeon can start from the midline in that zone and dissect the soft tissue laterally to end up on the transverse process and cross the VA while still on the transverse process. In other words, safe zone signifies the narrowest width of the transverse process at each level. In such an approach, the VA is protected from the inadvertent deep penetration of the instruments by the transverse process. The surgical safe zone for each level was the common area among at least 95% of the safe zones for that level. For the purpose of defining the upper and lower borders of the safe zone for each level, the line passing from the upper vertebral border perpendicular to the midline (upper vertebral border line) was used as a reference. Results: The surgical safe zone lies between 1 mm above and 1 mm below the upper vertebral border at the fourth vertebra, 2 mm above and 1 mm below the upper vertebral border at the fifth vertebra, and 1 mm above and 2 mm below the upper vertebral border of the sixth vertebra. The VA was observed to be tortuous in 13% of the intertransverse spaces. There is a positive association between disc degeneration and tortuosity of the VA at each level (p < 0.001). The artery becomes closer to the midline (p < 0.001) and moves posteriorly during its ascent. Conclusions: Dissection of the soft tissue off the bone along the surgical safe zone and removal of the transverse process afterward can be a practical and safe approach to avoid artery lacerations. The findings in the present study can be used in anterior approaches to the cervical spine, especially when the tortuosity of the artery mandates exposure of the VA prior to uncinate process resection, tumor excision, or VA repair.","https://thejns.org/view/journals/j-neurosurg-spine/12/1/article-p25.xml",""

We examined social interactions of the caveadapted, federally endangered, Texas blind salamander, Eurycea rathbuni, by examining sex-specific association patterns. We predicted that non-visual (chemical) cues would be an important mode of communication. We found no difference in association patterns between the sexes when presented with a single conspecific and no aggregative behaviours were detected. Interestingly, when given a simultaneous choice between a male or female, females preferred to associate with male conspecifics while males showed no clear preference. The results suggest that females of E. rathbuni use chemical cues to either seek males or avoid females and provide valuable insight into the little known social behaviour of this species and possibly other similar species.","https://brill.com/view/journals/amre/31/2/article-p294_16.xml",""

In findings from the randomized Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events trial, dutasteride reduced the risk of biopsy-detectable prostate cancer in high-risk men by 23% compared with placebo. Important clues about the dosing and window of susceptibility for supplementation with choline, vitamin D, and folate were revealed from epigenetic research that has implications for future nutritional epidemiology research. Noninvasive optical imaging techniques using endoscopic ultrasound and autofluorescence for the early detection of cancers in the lung, pancreas, and oral cavity are being studied.

They include Divergent Thinking, Visual Thinking, Spatial Reasoning, Qualitative Reasoning and Problem Formulation. A battery of standardized tests have been developed for these skills. We have previously reported on the contents and rationale for divergent thinking and visual thinking tests. This paper focuses on data collection and detailed statistical analysis of one test, namely the divergent thinking test. This particular test has been given to over 500 engineering students and a smaller number of practicing engineers. It is designed to evaluate four direct measures (fluency, flexibility, originality, quality) and four indirect measures (abstractability, afixability, detailability, decomplexability). The eight questions on the test overlap in some measures and the responses can be used to evaluate several measures independently (e.g., fluency and originality can be evaluated separately from the same idea set). The data on the 23 measured variables were factor analyzed using both exploratory and confirmatory procedures. Two variables were dropped from these exploratory analyses for reasons explained in the paper. For the remaining 21 variables, a four-factor solution with correlated (oblique) factors was deemed the best available solution after examining solutions with more factors. Five of the 21 variables did not load meaningfully on any of the four factors. These indirect measures did not appear to correlate strongly either among themselves, or with the other direct measures. The remaining 16 variables loaded on four factors as follows: The four factors correspond to the different measures belonging to each of the four questions. In other words, the different fluency, flexibility, or originality variables did not form factors limited to these forms of creative thinking. Instead the analyses showed factors associated with the questions themselves (with the exception of questions corresponding to indirect measures). The above four-factor structure was then taken into a confirmatory factor analytic procedure that adjusted for the missing data. After making some adjustments, the above four-factor solution was found to provide a reasonable fit to the data. Estimated correlations among the four factors (F) ranged from a high of .32 for F1 and F2 to a low of .06 for F3 and F4. All factor loadings were statistically significant.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/DETC2010-28886/4556295/367_1.pdf",""

Departments of Geography with degree programs in applied geography were surveyed to find out how important geospatial technology was in the preparation of students for meaningful jobs and careers. The Applied Geography Specialty Group of the Association of American Geographers (AAG) was also surveyed about the value of geospatial technology, as was the 95 academic programs that listed applied geography as a “program specialty” in the AAG Guide to Geography Programs in the Americas. There was a uniform agreement across these various groups that geospatial technology occupied an extremely important position in their overall course offerings, and if you are watching the workplace, such courses are not only sensible but offer critical employable skills for students upon graduation. It is widely known that geospatial technology education and training require a large commitment of departmental resources, including faculty lines, equipment expenditures, space, and technical support. A geography department and its university’s administration have to understand these unique requirements and allocate resources, more akin to a computer science department than a traditional academic unit. This reality is of immediate importance to geography departments because almost one quarter of all academic jobs advertised in geography over the last six years have been in the broad area of geospatial technology. A final conclusion to this research is a policy matter that suggests geography departments take a strong proprietorial position toward providing education in geospatial technology because other disciplines and training programs see opportunities in a rapidly expanding workplace skill and they are aggressively pursuing a niche of their own.</p>","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=38921",""

The wavefields within the transition area are determined by a weighted combination of the wavefields computed by the wave equation and the one-way wave equation to obtain a smooth variation from the inner area to the boundary via the transition zone. The results from our finite-difference numerical modeling tests of the 2D acoustic wave equation show that the absorption enforced by this scheme gradually increases with increasing width of the transition area. We obtain equally good performance using pseudospectral and finite-element modeling with the same scheme. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that use of 10 grid points for absorbing edge reflections attains nearly perfect absorption.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/1.3295447",""

Though the amount of certified organic land is increasing, the supply of organic foods lags behind demand in the United States. The reasons for this gap include a lack of government support for organics, and the peculiarities of organics as an innovation. In an attempt to close this gap, and increase the environmental sustainability of U.S. agriculture, this paper has two objectives. The first is to document the structural and institutional constraints to organic adoption. This is accomplished through a review of organic programs and policies in the U.S., in particular the National Organic Program. The second objective is to investigate the predictors of interest and the perceived barriers to organic adoption among pragmatic conventional producers in Texas, compared to organic and conventional producers. This is accomplished through a survey of a representative sample of producers in Texas. The results indicate that more than forty percent of producers who currently have conventional operations have at least some interest in organic production (pragmatic conventional producers). There are significant differences among the three groups in their structural and attitudinal characteristics related to organic adoption. For the pragmatic conventional producers, an increase in revenue would be a major facilitator of organic adoption. Their high levels of uncertainty regarding organic production and marketing, and especially organic certification constrain organic adoption. The results also reveal that the institutional setting in the U.S. hindered adoption. The paper concludes that increased institutional support would facilitate organic adoption.","https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/2/1/163/pdf",""

Two-dimensional dispersion analysis and numerical modeling demonstrate that this stencil has greater precision than one used in a conventional FD, when the same number of grid points is used in the calculation of the spatial derivatives. Thus, the spatial FD stencil based on time-space domain dispersion relation can be used to replace a conventional one such that we can achieve greater accuracy with almost no increase in computational cost.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/1.3374477",""

In the present study, we evaluated by microarray the expression of 484 microRNAs in the lungs of either ECS-free or ECS-exposed rats treated with the orally administered chemopreventive agents N-acetylcysteine, oltipraz, indole-3-carbinol, 5,6-benzoflavone, and phenethyl isothiocyanate (as single agents or in combinations). This is the first study of microRNA modulation by chemopreventive agents in nonmalignant tissues. Scatterplot, hierarchical cluster, and principal component analyses of microarray and quantitative PCR data showed that none of the above chemopreventive regimens appreciably affected the baseline microRNA expression, indicating potential safety. On the other hand, all of them attenuated ECS-induced alterations but to a variable extent and with different patterns, indicating potential preventive efficacy. The main ECS-altered functions that were modulated by chemopreventive agents included cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, Ras activation, P53 functions, NF-κB pathway, transforming growth factor–related stress response, and angiogenesis. Some microRNAs known to be polymorphic in humans were downregulated by ECS and were protected by chemopreventive agents. This study provides proof-of-concept and validation of technology that we are further refining to screen and prioritize potential agents for continued development and to help elucidate their biological effects and mechanisms. Therefore, microRNA analysis may provide a new tool for predicting at early carcinogenesis stages both the potential safety and efficacy of cancer chemopreventive agents.

The authors see the past decade as a formative phase of the research, characterized by attempts to bring theoretical coherence and rigor to the subject area. In their review of the management literature, the authors focus on this formative period in particular. They attempt to inspire and guide management researchers by clarifying what organizational reputation is. In particular, they identify three dominant conceptualizations, namely, that reputation consists of familiarity with the organization, beliefs about what to expect from the organization in the future, and impressions about the organization’s favorability. The final part of the review is an overview of recent empirical findings in the management literature pertaining to the effects or causes of organizational reputation. The authors conclude by drawing attention to some important directions for future research, including the needs to investigate organizational reputation as multidimensional and dynamic and to model its antecedents and effects as more complex than the unidirectional models typically proposed.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0149206310390963",""

These intrusions cause fluctuations in the water column sound speed profile which can have significant effects on acoustic propagation in shallow water. In this work, a linearized perturbative inverse technique is applied to estimate range-dependent water column sound speed profiles. This method utilizes estimates of horizontal wave numbers to determine sound speed as a function of depth. This technique is appropriate for the range-dependent shallow-water environment as horizontal wave numbers can be measured semilocally (1–2 km aperture) and their values are a direct measurement of the local environmental parameters. Difficulty is encountered in application of the perturbative inverse technique because the wave number data are insensitive to some portions of the waveguide and, as a result, the solution can deviate wildly from true values. This issue is addressed by application of approximate equality constraints which force the solution to be close to likely values at prescribed locations.","https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article-pdf/127/6/3411/15290854/3411_1_online.pdf",""

In the last 250 years, the temporal span of this study, Milan has played a key role in Italy's industrialization and as its gateway to the centres of economic and cultural modernization in Western Europe. This article proposes a spatial analytical methodology that incorporates geovisualization techniques to discover and map urban change in Milan. Using historical maps dating back to the eighteenth century and a 2005 official city map, we applied methods of spatial analysis and geovisualization techniques to determine which parts of the city changed the most in the time interval considered. We then drew parallels between urban changes and political changes in the history of the city. Urban change is defined here as a change in the form and structure of the city (new buildings, new or widened roads, new squares, etc.). Results indicate that morphological changes at the intra-urban scale in Milan appear to be spatially oriented to reflect national and international political events from the mid-eighteenth century to the present. Although this result was not unexpected, the extent to which changes in the built-up environment reflect historical events was somewhat surprising.","https://utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/carto.45.1.47",""

The incidence rate of CH has been reported to be increasing in the United States, but the factors behind the observed rate increase are not known. We summarize here the data presented at a workshop on CH, at which factors potentially related to the CH-incidence-rate increase (namely, race, ethnicity, sex, and birth outcomes) were evaluated. Data sources for the analyses included a national data set of newborn-screening results and state-specific data from newborn-screening programs in California, Massachusetts, New York, and Texas. The incidence rate of CH increased in the United States by 3% per year; however, an increase did not occur in all states, at a constant rate, or even at the same rate. Analysis of US data (1991–2000) showed a CH-incidence-rate increase only among white newborns. More recently, in California (2000–2007), the rate was constant in non-Hispanic newborns, but it increased among Hispanic newborns. In the national data, the CH-incidence rate increased similarly among boys and girls, whereas in Texas (1992–2006), the rate among boys increased significantly more than among girls and varied according to race and ethnicity. In Massachusetts (1995–2007), low birth weight newborns or newborns who had a delayed rise in thyrotropin concentration accounted for the majority of the recent rate increase. Race, ethnicity, sex, and pregnancy outcomes have affected the observed increasing incidence rate of CH, although there have been some inconsistencies and regional differences. The association with preterm birth or low birth weight could reflect the misclassification of some cases of transient hypothyroxinemia as true CH. Future studies of risk factors should focus on correct initial identification and reporting of demographic characteristics and pregnancy outcomes for cases of CH. In addition, long-term follow-up data of presumed cases of CH should be ascertained to differentiate true cases of CH from cases of transient hypothyroidism.","https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-pdf/125/Supplement_2/S37/891703/zpe10510000s37.pdf",""

An important risk factor in animal feed products is the presence of prohibited ruminant-derived bonemeal that may contain the BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) prion. Animal feed products are highly complex in composition and texture (i.e., vegetable products, mineral supplements, fish and chicken meal), and current contaminant detection systems rely heavily on laborintensive microscopy. In this study, we developed a training data set comprising 3.65 million hyperspectral profiles of which 1.15 million were from bonemeal samples, 2.31 million from twelve other feed materials, and 0.19 million denoting light green background (bottom of Petri dishes holding feed materials). Hyperspectral profiles in 150 spectral bands between 419 and 892 nm were analyzed. The classification approach was based on a sequence of linear discriminant analyses (LDA) to gradually improve the classification accuracy of hyperspectral profiles (reduce level of false positives), which had been classified as bonemeal in previous LDAs. That is, all hyperspectral profiles classified as bonemeal in an initial LDA (31% of these were false positives) were used as input data in a second LDA with new discriminant functions. Hyperspectral profiles classified as bonemeal in LDA2 (false positives were equivalent to 16%) were used as input data in a third LDA. This approach was repeated twelve times, in which at each step hyperspectral profiles were eliminated if they were classified as feed material (not bonemeal). Four independent feed materials were experimentally contaminated with 0–25% (by weight) bonemeal and used for validation. The analysis presented here provides support for development of an automated machine vision to detect bonemeal contamination around the 1% (by weight) level and therefore constitutes an important initial screening tool in comprehensive, rapid, and practically feasible quality control of feed materials.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1366/000370210791414335",""

The functioning mechanisms of most host range proteins are unclear, but many contain multiple ankyrin (ANK) repeats, a motif that is known for ligand interaction through a concave surface. We report here the crystal structure of one of the ANK repeat-containing host range proteins, the vaccinia virus K1 protein. The structure, at a resolution of 2.3 Å, showed that K1 consists entirely of ANK repeats, including seven complete ones and two incomplete ones, one each at the N and C terminus. Interestingly, Phe82 and Ser83, which were previously shown to be critical for K1's function, are solvent exposed and located on a convex surface, opposite the consensus ANK interaction surface. The importance of this convex surface was further supported by our additional mutagenesis studies. We found that K1's host range function was negatively affected by substitution of either Asn51 or Cys47 and completely abolished by substitution of both residues. Cys47 and Asn51 are also exposed on the convex surface, spatially adjacent to Phe82 and Ser83. Altogether, our data showed that K1 residues on a continuous convex ANK repeat surface are critical for the host range function, suggesting that K1 functions through ligand interaction and does so with a novel ANK interaction surface.","https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JVI.02332-09",""

This study tested the hypothesis that whole body heating attenuates the blood pressure response to a non-baroreflex-mediated sympathoexcitatory stimulus. Ten healthy subjects were instrumented for the measurement of integrated muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate, sweat rate, and forearm skin blood flow. Subjects were exposed to a cold pressor test (CPT) by immersing a hand in an ice water slurry for 3 min while otherwise normothermic and while heat stressed (i.e., increase core temperature ∼0.7°C via water-perfused suit). Mean responses from the final minute of the CPT were evaluated. In both thermal conditions CPT induced significant increases in MSNA and MAP without altering heart rate. Although the increase in MSNA to the CPT was similar between thermal conditions (normothermia: Δ14.0 ± 2.6; heat stress: Δ19.1 ± 2.6 bursts/min; P = 0.09), the accompanying increase in MAP was attenuated when subjects were heat stressed (normothermia: Δ25.6 ± 2.3, heat stress: Δ13.4 ± 3.0 mmHg; P < 0.001).

Antiangiogenic agent that targets both bFGF and VEGF (VEGFR) are considered to be effective adjuncts to the treatment of solid tumors or cancer preventive. Chinese sweet leaf tea, a hot water extract of Rubus suavissimus S. Lee (Rosaceae) (RUS) has been reported to have antiangiogenic activities evidenced by its ability to inhibit the angiogenic initiation and growth of human placental vein tissue (Liu et al., Phytother, Res. 20: 806-813, 2006) and experimental corneal neovascularization (Hakan, O.F., et al, Pharmaceu. Biol. 45: 44-47, 2007). We reported that this particular extract has the ability to inhibit the endothelial tubule formation, migration, and VEGF (VEGFR) of the HUVEC cells (Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res, 1432, 2009). Here we investigated the anti-angiogenic activity of GER, a combination of gallic acid, ellagic acid, and rubusoside purified from the RUS and the relevant molecular mechanisms using HUVEC cells. Our preliminary data demonstrated that GER (5 to 25 µg/ml) markedly inhibited migration of HUVEC cells compared to the vehicle control. This inhibitory effect was concentration-dependent. At a similar concentration, the endothelial tubule formation was almost completely inhibited. When HUVEC cells were treated with GER (5 to 20 µg/ml), the expression of both bFGF and VEGF were markedly inhibited even at the lowest starting concentration. These inhibitory effects were also concentration-dependent. To further confirm the involvement of VEGF pathway in GER-induced anti-angiogenic activity, the protein level of tyrosine kinase receptor VEGFR2 (Flk-1/KDR) was examined. Intriguingly, the expression of Flk-1 was significantly suppressed in HUVEC cells treated with GER (40 µg/ml) by 54.1% ± 2.3% in comparison to that of vehicle control. In contrast, VEGFR2 kinase activity and protein levels of VEGFR1 remained unchanged compared to that of the vehicle control. These results suggest that GER derived from the sweet leaf tea extract may be completely responsible for the observed anti-angiogenic effect of the sweet leaf tea reported previously by down-regulating proangiogenic factors bFGF and VEGF. The chemopreventive effect of GER and its parent extract RUS on the development of human pancreatic carcinoma (L3.6pl cells) in mouse orthotopic model is currently under investigation and will be reported.

There are also few useful diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers for this disease. We have combined a transgenic mouse model for invasive bladder cancer (UPII-SV40Tag mice) with DNA microarray technology to determine molecular mechanisms involved in early TCC development and to identify new biomarkers for detection, diagnosis, and prognosis of TCC. We have identified genes that are differentially expressed between the bladders of UPII-SV40Tag mice and their age-matched wild-type littermates at 3, 6, 20, and 30 weeks of age. These are ages that correspond to premalignant, carcinoma in situ, and early-stage and later stage invasive TCC, respectively. Our preliminary analysis of the microarray data sets has revealed ∼1,900 unique genes differentially expressed (≥3-fold difference at one or more time points) between wild-type and UPII-SV40Tag urothelium during the time course of tumor development. Among these, there were a high proportion of cell cycle regulatory genes and a proliferation signaling genes that are more strongly expressed in the UPII-SV40Tag bladder urothelium.

Test results for those who received the 2009 training showed an improvement in their knowledge about asthma. More than 95% of participants were very or somewhat satisfied with the Asthma 101 training. Test results in 2010 showed a significant improvement in participants’ knowledge in 2 areas: taking asthma medications to prevent an asthma episode ( P = .001) and occurrence of asthma symptoms ( P = .016). Two questions of statistical significance related to the use of medications and asthma episode demonstrated that nursing students had increased their knowledge in these areas. These findings suggest that health professionals can acquire additional knowledge from a brief yet focused training, such as the Asthma 101 training outlined in this article.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2150129710379014",""

In this study, we investigate the efficacy of dasatinib as initial therapy for patients with CML in early chronic phase. Patients and Methods: Patients with newly diagnosed CML in early chronic phase were randomly assigned to receive dasatinib 100 mg once daily or 50 mg twice daily as initial therapy. Results: Among 50 patients observed for at least 3 months, 49 patients (98%) achieved a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), and 41 patients (82%) achieved a major molecular response (MMR). Responses occurred rapidly, with 94% of patients achieving CCyR by 6 months. There was no difference in response rate by treatment arm. The projected event-free survival rate at 24 months is 88%, and all patients are alive after a median follow-up time of 24 months. Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 21% and 10% of patients, respectively. Nonhematologic toxicity was usually grade 1 to 2. There was no significant difference in toxicity between the two arms, and the actual median dose at 12 months was 100 mg (range, 20 to 100 mg). Conclusion: Dasatinib is an effective agent for the initial management of CML in early chronic phase, producing high rates of CCyR and MMR.","https://ascopubs.org/doi/pdfdirect/10.1200/JCO.2009.25.4920",""

Data are taken from New Britain police dispatch statistics and applied to a study of arrests and citizen calls for assistance across 738 U.S. Census block collection units (BCUs). The article employs tests of significance to assess the overall effects of zoning on these police activities across pre- and post-intervention periods and uses both weighted displacement quotient (WDQ) and exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) models to test for possible displacement associated with zoning. Results indicate that weed and seed zoning was significantly associated with displacement of arrest activity in pre- and post-intervention time periods but displayed no relationship with displacement of calls for assistance (CFAs). Though WDQ analyses do not indicate proximity effects, local indicators of spatial association (LISA) maps show noteworthy changes in the spatial clustering of arrest activity over time. Of principal concern here is the idea that weed and seed may prompt changes in the geography of crime without actually reducing crime rates. An ancillary concern is whether significantly higher arrest rates within weed and seed zones represent advances in community policing.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1098611109357323",""

The resulting failures have been described as the “valley of death.” Progress into the future will require new considerations and the engagement of a broad band of stakeholders. To identify novel therapeutics that are likely to succeed in late development and to be meaningful for clinical practice, investigators will need to make a paradigm shift in designing clinical trials and endpoints while adhering to scientific rigor when interpreting results and making informed decisions. Large phase III trials that show a modest incremental benefit will continue to diminish in value for patients, clinicians, payers, and industry. Outcomes that are robust in both magnitude and application to the real world will take on increasing importance. Ensuring active participation by patients, lowering barriers to health care access, and protecting patients through health care reform are requirements for the future success of the cancer clinical research enterprise. The challenge today is to develop new approaches to translate scientific discovery into cost-effective and meaningful improvements in cancer outcomes.

The background flow for this linear model is obtained from potential vorticity inversion constrained by the nonlinear balance equation. The forcing imposed in the linear model is derived from an imbalance in the large-scale flow—that is, the forcing or imbalance in the vorticity, divergence, and thermodynamic equations, respectively. The response from the sum of these imbalanced forcings obtained from the linear dynamics shows well-defined gravity wave signals, which compare reasonably well in terms of location, phase, and amplitude with the gravity waves simulated in a fully nonlinear nonhydrostatic mesoscale model. It is found that the vorticity forcing, largely due to the advection of balanced relative vorticity, is the leading contributor to the gravity waves in the exit region of the vortex-dipole jet.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jas/article-pdf/67/5/1438/3517730/2010jas3327_1.pdf",""

We studied families that included multiple relatives affected by lung cancer. Results from linkage analysis showed strong evidence that a region of chromosome 6q affects lung cancer risk. To characterize the effects that this region of chromosome 6q region has on lung cancer risk, we identified a haplotype that segregated with lung cancer. We then performed Cox regression analysis to estimate the differential effects that smoking behaviors have on lung cancer risk according to whether each individual carried a risk-associated haplotype or could not be classified and was assigned unknown haplotypic status. We divided smoking exposures into never smokers, light smokers (&lt;20 pack-years), moderate smokers (20 to &lt;40 pack-years), and heavy smokers (≥40 pack-years). Comparing results according to smoking behavior stratified by carrier status, compared with never smokers, there was weakly increasing risk for increasing smoking behaviors, with the hazards ratios being 3.44, 4.91, and 5.18, respectively, for light, moderate, or heavy smokers, whereas among the individuals from families without the risk haplotype, the risks associated with smoking increased strongly with exposure, the hazards ratios being, respectively, 4.25, 9.17, and 11.89 for light, moderate, and heavy smokers. The never smoking carriers had a 4.71-fold higher risk than the never smoking individuals without known risk haplotypes. These results identify a region of chromosome 6q that increases risk for lung cancer and that confers particularly higher risks to never and light smokers.

The scapula provides attachment for many soft tissue structures. Therefore, many have hypothesized that posterior shoulder tightness may alter proper scapular kinematics. Hypothesis: As posterior shoulder tightness increases, so will forward scapular posture. Baseball players will have a significantly more forward scapular position of their dominant arm compared with their nondominant arm. The bilateral difference in forward scapular posture will be greater in pitchers than in position players, indicating pitchers have more forward scapular posture. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Bilateral forward scapular posture, glenohumeral horizontal adduction, and rotational range of motion were measured among 20 professional baseball pitchers and 20 position players. Results: A regression analysis showed a moderate to good negative relationship between glenohumeral horizontal adduction range of motion and forward scapular posture (r2 = .50, P = .001). T tests demonstrated that the dominant shoulders of both groups had significantly more forward scapular posture compared with nondominant shoulders (P < .004). There were no other significant relationships or differences found (r2 < .04, P > .15). Conclusion: There was a moderate to good relationship between posterior shoulder tightness and forward scapular posture. Furthermore, baseball players had more forward scapular posture of the dominant arm than the nondominant arm. These results suggest that posterior shoulder tightness as evidenced by decreased glenohumeral adduction range of motion may be considered a partial predictor for excessive forward scapular posture and vice versa. Because of the association between this scapular dyskinesis and shoulder dysfunction, clinicians may find it advantageous to address these characteristics when examining and treating such athletes.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0363546510370291",""

Positive coping variables included hope, proactive coping style, and sense of humor, whereas negative coping variables included perceptions of stress, dysfunctional attitudes, and catastrophizing. Evaluations of self-worth were determined by measures of self-esteem and acceptance of disability. Quality of life and life satisfaction were indicators of subjective well-being. The results of the study indicate that negative coping has a negative association with both positive self-worth and subjective well-being. Feelings of positive self-worth were found to be positively associated with subjective well-being. In addition, positive coping appears to influence subjective well-being positively by first increasing feelings of positive self-worth.

The linear relationship of LnR versus T−1/2 with and without a magnetic field confirms the physical picture of thermally assisted interparticle tunneling. A sign inversion of tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) from negative to positive with decreasing temperature was observed. In the high temperature region, the core/shell nanoparticles show negative TMR similar to that of Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The magnitude of the TMR in the FePt/Fe3O4 core/shell nanoparticle systems is smaller than that in Fe3O4 nanoparticle systems, likely due to lower spin polarization of conducting electrons in FePt. However the MR becomes positive in the low temperature region. We propose that this behavior originates from the resonance tunneling between the FePt cores via the defect states near the Fermi level in the Fe3O4 shells which dominates the magnetotransport of the FePt/Fe3O4 nanoparticle system at low temperatures.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.3505778/14813036/103905_1_online.pdf",""

Data sources: Articles were identified via a search of the MEDLINE database, including publications from 1979 to December 2009, using a search string that included the terms parenteral nutrition, lipid emulsion, fat emulsion, IVFE, safety, adverse effect, neonate intralipid, and terms describing a range of specific adverse events (AEs) such as pancreatitis. Study selection and data extraction: We selected articles that allowed us to compare the results of clinical trials involving delivery of medications via IVFEs with the historical use and effects of IVFEs in parenteral nutrition, with an emphasis on AEs. We focused on 2 drugs in current use that are administered intravenously in lipid emulsions: propofol and clevidipine. Data synthesis: Clearance of the fat particles in IVFEs is mediated by the enzyme lipoprotein lipase. AEs are more likely if the rate or duration of IVFE administration exceeds the enzyme's clearance capacity. AEs are also more likely after administration of a 10% IVFE formulation than a 20% formulation, because the higher concentration of free phospholipid in the 10% formulation interferes with lipoprotein lipase activity. AEs can be reduced by administering IVFEs at a dosage ≤2.5 g/kg/day and at a rate ≤0.11 g/kg/h. The anesthetic agent propofol, which is formulated in a 10% IVFE, has been used clinically for 25 years. Typical AEs associated with propofol use include infection, high plasma triglyceride concentrations, and pancreatitis. Recent clinical trials involving clevidipine, which is formulated in a 20% IVFE, have demonstrated a low rate of lipid-related AEs. Conclusions: The results of this review demonstrate that IVFEs are well tolerated when administered in accordance with guideline recommendations.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1345/aph.1M626",""

Utilization of systematic methods or tools that aid in the design process is recognized as standard practice in industry and academia. The tools are used for a number of design activities (i.e., idea generation, concept generation, inspiration searches, functional modeling) and can span across engineering disciplines, the sciences (i.e., biology, chemistry) or a non-engineering domain (i.e., medicine), with an overall focus of encouraging creative engineering designs. Engineers, however, have struggled with utilizing the vast amount of biological information available from the natural world around them. Often it is because there is a knowledge gap or terminology is difficult, and the time needed to learn and understand the biology is not feasible. This paper presents an engineering-to-biology thesaurus, which we propose affords engineers, with limited biological background, a tool for leveraging nature’s ingenuity during many steps of the design process. Additionally, the tool could also increase the probability of designing biologically-inspired engineering solutions. Biological terms in the thesaurus are correlated to the engineering domain through pairing with a synonymous function or flow term of the Functional Basis lexicon, which supports functional modeling and abstract representation of any functioning system. The second version of the thesaurus presented in this paper represents an integration of three independent research efforts, which include research from Oregon State University, the University of Toronto, and the Indian Institute of Science, and their industrial partners. The overall approach for term integration and the final results are presented. Applications to the areas of design inspiration, comprehension of biological information, functional modeling, creative design and concept generation are discussed. An example of comprehension and functional modeling are presented.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/DETC2010-28233/4556632/117_1.pdf",""

Biological organisms, phenomena and strategies, herein referred to as biological systems, are, in essence, living engineered systems. These living systems provide insight into sustainable and adaptable design and offer engineers billions of years of valuable experience, which can be used to inspire engineering innovation. This research presents a general method for functionally representing biological systems through systematic design techniques, affording conceptualization of biologically-inspired, engineering designs. Functional representation and abstraction techniques are utilized to translate biological systems into an engineering context. Thus, the biological system information is accessible to engineering designers with varying biological knowledge, but a common understanding of engineering design methods. Functional modeling is typically driven by customer needs or product re-designs; however, these cannot be applied to biological systems. Thus, we propose the use of biological category and scale to guide the design process. Mimicry categories and scales, in addition to answering a design question, aid the designer with defining boundaries or scope when developing a biological functional model. Biological category assists with framing the information in the right perspective, where as, biological scale deals with how much detail is required for an adequate representation of the biological system to utilize the information with a chosen engineering design method. In our case, the engineering design method is function-based design. Choosing a category serves to refine the boundary, but, like scale, its consideration might prompt the designer to consider the same biological system in a new and unique way leading to new ideas.

Although studies show that males have lower self-control than females, rarely have researchers questioned whether items used to measure self-control should be used for both groups. This study uses a Rasch rating scale analysis to assess item functioning of Grasmick et al.’s 24-item self-control scale for males and females. Using a sample of young adults, results indicate that 33% of the scale items showed differential functioning or item bias; that is, after controlling for self-control, females found one third of the items to be either more or less agreeable than males. Once biased items were removed from the scale, males, on average, still had lower self-control than females. In addition, after excluding biased items from the scale, the effect of self-control on criminal behavior and other outcomes was similar to the effect found with the full 24-item scale. Suggestions for future research on Grasmick et al.’s self-control scale are offered, and limitations of the current study are discussed.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0093854810369082",""

Results indicate that the importance of marriage as a personal goal is positively associated with subjective religiosity. The estimated net effects of subjective religiosity are also stronger for women in two-parent families versus those in other family structures. Conservative Protestant women anticipate marrying earlier than others; church attendance and subjective religiosity are also positively related to expectation of earlier marriage.

Many are soil organisms and are generally distributed worldwide, though certain species appear to have restricted geographic ranges. Though they are uncommon causes of disease, melanized fungi have been increasingly recognized as important pathogens, with most reports occurring in the past 20 years. The spectrum of diseases with which they are associated has also broadened and includes allergic disease, superficial and deep local infections, pneumonia, brain abscess, and disseminated infection. For some infections in immunocompetent individuals, such as allergic fungal sinusitis and brain abscess, they are among the most common etiologic fungi. Melanin is a likely virulence factor for these fungi. Diagnosis relies on careful microscopic and pathological examination, as well as clinical assessment of the patient, as these fungi are often considered contaminants. Therapy varies depending upon the clinical syndrome. Local infection may be cured with excision alone, while systemic disease is often refractory to therapy.

In general, the results of this research indicated that (1) the addition of the WMA additives into the PMA binders showed positive effects on increasing rutting resistance at high temperature (based on the high failure temperature values from the DSR test); (2) the PMA binders containing the additives were observed to be less resistant to fatigue cracking at intermediate temperatures compared to the control PMA binders (based on the G*sin δ values at 25 °C from the DSR test); and (3) the addition of wax additive represented a possible lower resistance on low temperature cracking (based on the stiffness and the m-value at –12 °C from the BBR test).","http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/full-xml/10.1139/L09-118",""

The authors propose to extend relational algebra with a novel relational operator, nested optional join (NOJ), that is more efficient than left outer join in processing nested optional patterns of well-designed graph patterns. They design three efficient algorithms to implement the new operator in relational databases: (1) nested-loops NOJ algorithm, NL-NOJ, (2) sort-merge NOJ algorithm, SM-NOJ, and (3) simple hash NOJ algorithm, SH-NOJ. Using a real life RDF dataset, the authors demonstrate the efficiency of their algorithms by comparing them with the corresponding left outer join implementations and explore the effect of join selectivity on the performance of these algorithms.","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=41658",""

Service-learning teaching strategies naturally fit into horticulture and landscape design curricula, since hands-on laboratories are often incorporated into lesson plans. The purpose of this study was to integrate service-learning techniques into a university-level horticulture course and measure the impact of the course on students’ perceptions of community involvement, perceptions of social impact, and perception of how well the students felt they learned the course material. Students in an undergraduate landscape design class were taught the process of landscape design using service-learning activities within the city and campus communities. Projects included developing designs for campus gardens, the city post office, neighborhood parks, the campus childcare center, city road median areas and the city women's shelter, and other projects. A survey tool was developed from other existing surveys to measure how students felt about service learning as a means to learn skills in class and to measure their perceptions of community involvement and social impact. Currently enrolled students were surveyed and alumni from five classes taught in a similar manner in previous years were surveyed. Results from the study showed major differences in that students felt more positive about community involvement after the course compared with before the course. Students rated their feelings of social impact and learning course material above the neutral levels in both categories. No differences were found in gender and grade point average (GPA) comparisons in any of the categories, with the exception of the social impact statements with males and students with higher GPAs rating their feelings more positively within that category. Additionally, differences were found in comparisons of alumni vs. current students, with alumni feeling more positive about how well they learned course material compared to current students.","https://journals.ashs.org/downloadpdf/journals/horttech/20/5/article-p934.xml",""

Also, the power distribution across the die surface is not uniform, resulting in hot spots. The increase in die temperature results in decreased performance and reliability and increased leakage currents and cooling costs. Spreading activity across a multi-core chip is increasingly being considered as a way to contain chip temperatures while minimally degrading performance. This paper investigates power migration, or “core hopping,” which involves dynamic allocation of workload among the cores on a many-core processor. This work numerically analyzed core hopping for different configurations of a many-core processor, and performed the migration based on both time of activity and temperature of individual cores.

Although older adults tend to report a higher intake of fruit and vegetables than other age groups, over half of the U.S. older population does not meet the recommendation of five daily servings of fruit and vegetables. Research has shown that gardening is one way of improving fruit and vegetable intake. The primary focuses of this study were to examine and compare fruit and vegetable consumption of gardeners and nongardeners and to investigate any differences in fruit and vegetable consumption of long-term gardeners when compared with newer gardeners in adults older than age 50 years. An online survey was designed to be answered by older adults (50 years or older) and respondents self-selected themselves for inclusion in the study. A total of 261 questionnaires was completed. Data collected were analyzed using statistical procedures, including descriptive statistics, Pearson's product-moment correlations, and multivariate analysis of variance. The results of this research supports previous studies that indicated gardeners were more likely to consume vegetables when compared with nongardeners. However, these results were not found with regard to fruit consumption between gardeners and nongardeners. Additionally, the length of time an individual reported having participated in gardening activities seemed to have no relationship to the number of vegetables and fruit reported as consumed, which suggests gardening intervention programs late in life would be an effective method of boosting vegetable and fruit consumption in older adults.

PREs are coherent mesoscale regions of heavy rainfall, with rainfall rates ≥100 mm (24 h)−1, that can occur approximately 1000 km poleward of recurving tropical cyclones (TCs). PREs occur most commonly in August and September, and approximately 36 h prior to the arrival of the main rain shield associated with the TC. A distinguishing feature of PREs is that they are sustained by deep tropical moisture that is transported poleward directly from the TC. PREs are high-impact weather events that can often result in significant inland flooding, either from the PRE itself or from the subsequent arrival of the main rain shield associated with the TC that falls onto soils already saturated by the PRE.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/mwr/article-pdf/138/8/3272/4259607/2010mwr3243_1.pdf",""

Curves may present a challenging situation during adverse conditions or to inattentive drivers. Chevron signs provide advance warning and positive guidance through the curve. Some agencies place supplemental retroreflective material on chevron signposts to enhance the signs’ conspicuity and visibility. The objective of this study was to determine any incremental benefits in vehicle speed and lateral lane position when retroreflective material was applied to chevron signposts. This study evaluated three scenarios in a before-and-after experimental design. The before evaluation presented no vertical delineation (baseline). The two after evaluations consisted of a series of standard chevrons (chevrons) and chevrons with fully retroreflective posts (full-post chevrons). Traffic counters measured vehicle speed and lateral lane position at the point of curvature and midpoint of the curve at two separate study sites. Findings showed that chevrons and full-post chevrons moved vehicles away from oncoming traffic by about 15 in. Overall, there was little difference between the lateral position findings of the two chevron treatment scenarios. Chevrons achieved a 1.28-mph reduction in mean vehicle speed from the baseline evaluation, and full-post chevrons obtained a 2.20-mph reduction. The findings determined that the benefits of full-post chevrons were not substantial. Researchers recommend that the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) should continue to present full-post chevrons as an optional delineation tool. On the basis of this research, the researchers do not recommend any changes to the MUTCD.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/2149-04",""

Limited empirical evidence exists that correlates a combination of these factors. In addition, a diminished level of organizational commitment may affect truckload drivers’ attitude and/or focus while operating these very large trucks and as a result lead to an increase in crashes. Injuries, fatalities, and accident costs are reviewed as evidence of the magnitude and consequences of truckload crashes.

Subordinates submit budgets to superiors regarding two projects in a face-to-face setting. There are three treatments: (1) AGG, wherein subordinates privately observe each project’s cost and submit one budget regarding the aggregate cost of the two projects, (2) SEQ, wherein subordinates observe and submit individual budgets sequentially, so are uncertain about the second-project cost when they submit their first-project budget, and (3) DEL, wherein budgets are delayed, so that subordinates observe both costs before providing individual budgets. In all treatments superiors must approve the budget and subordinates can create more slack by submitting a larger budget. Based on image management, guilt alleviation, and preferences for honesty, we hypothesize that subordinates will (1) create more slack in AGG than in the other two treatments, (2) create more slack in DEL than in SEQ, and (3) decrease their slack creation from the first project to the second project more in SEQ than in DEL. Our results generally support all three hypotheses. However, analysis of the results does not support our a priori beliefs regarding the nonpecuniary motivations of subordinates. We argue, a posteriori, that a likely explanation for our findings is that increased face-to-face interactions in SEQ and DEL cause subordinates to care more about the welfare of the superior than in AGG. In general, the results indicate that frequent budget interactions may provide control benefits to superiors.","https://publications.aaahq.org/bria/article-pdf/22/1/67/53798/bria_2010_22_1_67.pdf",""

Scholars have shown that members of minor religious groups are less anti-immigrant than members of majority affiliations and that Evangelical Protestants are particularly hostile. Other scholars have demonstrated that increased religiosity reduces immigrant animus. Here, we argue that religion affects immigration attitudes via a distinct religiously informed interpretation of America’s national identity, which we call Christian nationalism. Christian nationalists believe that America has a divinely inspired mission and link its success to God’s favor. Using social identity complexity theory, we argue that citizens who ascribe to this worldview should be least tolerant of those they perceive as symbolic threats to American national identity. We assess this claim using the 2006 Pew Immigration Attitudes Survey and the 2008 Cooperative Congressional Election Survey. Christian nationalism is a robust determinant of immigrant animus, whereas religious affiliation only affects immigrant animus when Christian nationalism is excluded.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1532673X10371300",""

This imbalance, in a majority of instances, can be traced back to doctoral education. Doctoral programs in marketing are designed to prepare students for becoming successful marketing professors. An important component of becoming a successful professor is learning how to teach effectively. Yet doctoral programs fall short of providing adequate pedagogical training. Consequently, marketing educators, from their doctoral days through their professorial careers, have a responsibility to continuously work on their competence in teaching. However, how can marketing educators in general and marketing doctoral students in particular develop pedagogical competence (PC)? In this article, the authors deconstruct PC into five components: content knowledge (or knowledge of subject matter), knowledge of pedagogical approaches, course management capability, classroom management capability, and student management capability. Next, they discuss how individuals can develop PC and the implications of PC for marketing education. Specifically, the authors discuss issues and implications for doctoral students, doctoral programs, marketing departments, and marketing faculty.

Of primary interest is whether elementary school principals from preparation programs with certain types of characteristics are more or less likely to build teams of well-qualified teachers who, in turn, positively affect overall student achievement. A secondary purpose is to establish a relationship between the overall school-level qualifications of teams of teachers and school-level student achievement on the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) to underscore the importance of the first relationship. Research Design: This quantitative study utilizes ordinary least squares regression to analyze seven extracts of data from the Texas Education Agency, merged together to create a data set that matched teachers, principals, school characteristics, and student achievement to individual schools. First, the authors establish the relationship between school-level teacher-team quality and school-level student outcomes on the TAKS. Second, they examine the relationship between principal preparation program characteristics and the measures of teacher-team quality after controlling for principal characteristics, school characteristics, and student achievement. Furthermore, because the authors hypothesize that principals cannot quickly alter the quality of teams of teachers in schools, they examine school achievement and teacher-team quality over four years.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0011000010378613",""

Here, we attempted to confirm the second variant on 15q24-25.1 in several large sporadic lung cancer populations and determined what percentage of additional risk for lung cancer is due to the genetic effect of the second variant. SNPs rs1051730 and rs481134 were genotyped in 2,818 lung cancer cases and 2,766 controls from four populations. Joint analysis of these two variants (rs1051730 and rs481134) on 15q24-25.1 identified three major haplotypes (G_T, A_C, and G_C) and provided stronger evidence for association of 15q24-25.1 with lung cancer (P = 9.72 × 10−9). These two variants represent three levels of risk associated with lung cancer. The most common haplotype G_T is neutral; the haplotype A_C is associated with increased risk for lung cancer with 5.0% higher frequency in cases than in controls [P = 1.68 × 10−7; odds ratio (OR), 1.24; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.14–1.35]; whereas the haplotype G_C is associated with reduced risk for lung cancer with 4.4% lower frequency in cases than in controls (P = 7.39 × 10−7; OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.73–0.87).

Differences in white‐tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus morphometrics across soil resource areas in Mississippi, USA, provide opportunity to test the predictive capacity of soil chemical and forage quality variables. Using principal components analysis (PCA), we modeled variation in body mass and antler score of ≥ 1.5‐year‐old male deer against seven soil chemical variables and 12 forage quality variables to elucidate potential nutritional factors corresponding with physical variation among 21 deer populations. We developed separate sets of models at the levels of state and soil resource area (Delta, Thin Loess and Lower Coastal Plain) and compared statewide models with general linear models (GLM) that related deer morphometrics to nominal classification variables representing the three soil resource areas. PCA distinguished a gradient of increasing soil fertility and forage quality that explained 58% of body mass and 52% of antler score variation statewide. However, the GLM using soil resource area as the explanatory variable explained 78 and 61%, respectively, indicating that management models should use soil resource area to designate areas with broadly similar nutritional planes. Within soil resource areas, the region with the greatest soil fertility and forage quality (Delta) did not model successfully for either body mass or antler score. The Thin Loess was successfully modeled for antler score, but only the Lower Coastal Plain, which had the lowest level of soil and forage quality, was successfully modeled for both morphometric variables. The Delta may have represented an area with habitat quality sufficiently high to render small variations non‐influential. In contrast, the generally poorer soil quality of Thin Loess and Lower Coastal Plain soils and forages may act as a limiting factor on physical expression, which allowed some response to relatively small fluctuations in range quality. The potential utility of soil and forage metrics within soil resource areas to estimate deer physical qualities appears to be primarily for fine‐tuning estimates largely determined by factors such as density and land use.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.2981/10-041",""

Evidence to support the existence of a loosely coupled system was the willingness of officers to expand and broaden their traditional roles and appropriately share power, such that there was no mission distortion and role confusion observed. Information sharing efforts had a significant impact on dissolving old ways of thinking about traditional roles and instead built a new sense of trust, improved morale, and greater access to information.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1541204010374298",""

The objective of this research is to propose a valuation financial model to facilitate universal design strategies that will maximize the expected profit under uncertain constrains. Real options analysis is applied to estimate the valuation of options related to introducing new modules as a platform in a universal product family. We use customers’ preferences based on performance utilities for universal design to reflect demand and demographic trends. To demonstrate implementation of the proposed model, we use a case study involving a family of light-duty trucks.

Spin-orbit couplings between the PESs were calculated using state averaged CASSCF wave functions. More accurate energies were obtained for the CASSCF structures with the MRMP2/aug-cc-pVDZ method. An important and necessary aspect of the calculations was the need to use different CASSCF active spaces for the different reaction paths on the investigated PESs. The CASSCF calculations focused on O2+C2H4 addition to form the C2H4O2 biradical on the triplet and singlet surfaces, and isomerization reaction paths ensuing from this biradical. The triplet and singlet C2H4O2 biradicals are very similar in structure, primarily differing in their C-C-O-O dihedral angles. The MRMP2 values for the O2+C2H4→C2H4O2 barrier to form the biradical are 33.8 and 6.1 kcal/mol, respectively, for the triplet and singlet surfaces. On the singlet surface, C2H4O2 isomerizes to dioxetane and ethane-peroxide with MRMP2 barriers of 7.8 and 21.3 kcal/mol.

Cast-in-place construction can require more time on-site to build forms, pour the concrete, and allow for curing. This time constraint results in an increase in disruption to traffic and more exposure for construction workers. Furthermore, the installation of a moment slab is very costly and requires an additional construction phase to build the slab. Because the slab is normally under the shoulder and possibly the lanes, the disruption of traffic flow is increased. A new application of a precast 42-in.-tall single-slope concrete barrier for use in front of steep slopes was developed that does not require a moment slab. The lateral movement of the barrier is restricted by embedding it in soil. This design also reduces the embankment behind the barrier to 2 ft. The embedded barrier application was successfully evaluated under Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware Test Level 3 criteria. The permanent deflection of the barrier was 5.5 in. The use of the embedded concrete barrier in lieu of the typically installed barrier with a moment slab is expected to result in cost savings of approximately $300 per linear foot and reduced time to construct.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/2195-13",""

UCMSC can be used as carriers for targeted delivery of genes or therapeutics and for local production of biologic agents. The therapeutic strategy using UCMSC as cellular vehicles for targeted gene delivery can avoid the problem of short life or excessive toxicity of a particular gene product in vivo. Interferon-β (IFN-β) has demonstrated a potent anti-tumor effect on many tumor cell lines in vitro. However, in vivo inhibition of tumor cell growth by IFN-β required blood concentrations much higher than the maximally tolerated dose. Therefore, clinical therapy by systemic administration of IFN-β was not possible. The aim of this study was to determine the anti-cancer effect of IFN-β gene transfected-UCMSC (IFN-UCMSC) on bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) cell lines in vitro and in vivo. The conditioned medium derived from IFN-UCMSC significantly attenuated cell growth of H358 and SW1573 BAC cell lines in vitro compared to the medium derived from non-transfected UCMSC. The percentage of dead cells, as measured by the trypan blue exclusion test, was significantly higher in the cells treated with the medium derived from IFN-UCMSC than UCMSC alone. The co-culture of IFN-UCMSC with cancer cells inhibited cell growth significantly through stimulation of apoptosis. Finally, systemic administration of IFN-UCMSC (0.3 million cells/injection, 5 day interval for four times) markedly attenuated tumor multiplicity and size of orthotopic H358 BAC xenografts in SCID mouse lungs. Histochemical analysis of the tumors indicated tumor-targeted localization of UCMSC and significant reduction of tumor cell proliferation index as measured by Ki-67 staining. These results clearly indicated that IFN-β production by IFN-UCMSC attenuated growth of BAC cells by inducing programmed cell death both in vitro and in vivo. This research clearly demonstrated that IFN-UCMSC are a powerful anti-cancer therapeutic tool as delivery vehicles for IFN-β. This work was supported by the KSU Terry C.

However, in service contexts that require dynamically deciding whether to accept incoming jobs and what resource to assign to each accepted job, harnessing the benefits of flexibility requires using effective methods for making these operational decisions. Motivated by the resource deployment decisions facing a professional service firm in the workplace training industry, we address the dynamic job acceptance and resource assignment problem for systems with general resource flexibility structure, i.e., with multiple resource types that can each perform different overlapping subsets of job types. We first show that, for systems containing specialized resources for individual job types and a versatile resource type that can perform all job types, the exact policy uses a threshold rule. With more general flexibility structures, since the associated stochastic dynamic program is intractable, we develop and test three optimization‐based approximate policies. Our extensive computational tests show that one of the methods, which we call the Bottleneck Capacity Reservation policy, is remarkably effective in generating near‐optimal solutions over a wide range of problem scenarios. We also consider a model variant that requires dynamic job acceptance decisions but permits deferring resource assignment decisions until the end of the horizon. For this model, we discuss an adaptation of our approximate policy, establish the effectiveness of this policy, and assess the value of postponing assignment decisions.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2009.01095.x",""

No relationship between the number of police officers per capita and perceptions of the risk of arrest was found, suggesting that increases in police manpower will not increase general deterrent effects and decreases will not reduce these effects. The authors also considered the possibility that police manpower levels influence the number of criminals incarcerated, and thus affect crime rates via the incapacitative effects of incarceration, but concluded that such an effect is unlikely.

The authors propose that sustainability may not always be an asset, even if most consumers care about social and environmental issues. The degree to which sustainability enhances preference depends on the type of benefit consumers most value for the product category in question. In this research, the authors demonstrate that consumers associate higher product ethicality with gentleness-related attributes and lower product ethicality with strength-related attributes. As a consequence of these associations, the positive effect of product sustainability on consumer preferences is reduced when strength-related attributes are valued, sometimes even resulting in preferences for less sustainable product alternatives (i.e., the “sustainability liability”). Conversely, when gentleness-related attributes are valued, sustainability enhances preference. In addition, the authors show that the potential negative impact of sustainability on product preferences can be attenuated using explicit cues about product strength.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1509/jmkg.74.5.018",""

OBJECTIVES:: To define the burden of hospitalizations related to RSV and non-RSV bronchiolitis in a tertiary-care children's hospital from 2002 to 2007 and to identify the risk factors associated with severe disease. METHODS:: Medical records of patients hospitalized for bronchiolitis were reviewed for demographic, clinical, microbiologic, and radiologic characteristics as well as the presence of underlying medical conditions. Differences were evaluated between children with RSV and non-RSV bronchiolitis, and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for severe disease. RESULTS:: Bronchiolitis hospitalizations in children younger than 2 years old (n = 4800) significantly increased from 536 (3.3%) in 2002 to 1241 (5.5%) in 2007, mainly because of RSV infections. Patients with RSV bronchiolitis (n = 2840 [66%]) were younger at hospitalization and had a lower percentage of underlying medical conditions than children hospitalized with non-RSV bronchiolitis (27 vs 37.5%; P &lt; .001). However, disease severity defined by length of hospitalization and requirement of supplemental oxygen, intensive care, and mechanical ventilation was significantly worse in children with RSV bronchiolitis. RSV infection and prematurity, regardless of the etiology, were identified as independent risk factors for severe bronchiolitis. CONCLUSIONS:: There was a significant increase in hospitalizations for RSV bronchiolitis from 2002 to 2007. A majority of the children with RSV bronchiolitis were previously healthy, but their disease severity was worse compared with those hospitalized with non-RSV bronchiolitis.","https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-pdf/126/6/e1453/1054678/zpe012100e1453.pdf",""

However, the mechanism of MLL-mediated leukemic transformation is not fully understood. Dot1, the only known histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79) methyltransferase, has been shown to interact with multiple MLL fusion partners including AF9, ENL, AF10, and AF17. In this study, we utilize a conditional Dot1l deletion model to investigate the role of Dot1 in hematopoietic progenitor cell immortalization by MLL fusion proteins. Western blot and mass spectrometry show that Dot1-deficient cells are depleted of the global H3K79 methylation mark. We find that loss of Dot1 activity attenuates cell viability and colony formation potential of cells immortalized by MLL oncoproteins but not by the leukemic oncoprotein E2a-Pbx1. Although this effect is most pronounced for MLL-AF9, we find that Dot1 contributes to the viability of cells immortalized by other MLL oncoproteins that are not known to directly recruit Dot1. Cells immortalized by MLL fusions also show increased apoptosis, suggesting the involvement of Dot1 in survival pathways. In summary, our data point to a pivotal requirement for Dot1 in MLL fusion protein–mediated leukemogenesis and implicate Dot1 as a potential therapeutic target.

We use warm season, high‐frequency, near‐surface states and turbulent fluxes collected over nine sites in the U.S. Southern Great Plains. We quantify changes in the pattern of sensitive parameters, the amount and nature of the interaction between parameters, and the covariance structure of the distribution of behavioral parameter sets. Using Sobol′'s total and first‐order sensitivity indexes, we show that few parameters directly control the variance of the model response. Significant parameter interaction occurs. Optimal parameter values differ between models, and the relationships between parameters also change. GW decreases unwarranted parameter interaction and appears to improve model realism, especially at wetter study sites. DV increases parameter interaction and decreases identifiability, implying it is overparameterized and/or underconstrained. At a wet site, GW has two functional modes: one that mimics STD and a second in which GW improves model function by decoupling direct evaporation and base flow. Unsupervised classification of the posterior distributions of behavioral parameter sets cannot group similar sites based solely on soil or vegetation type, helping to explain why transferability between sites and models is not straightforward.

The IHC protocol was progressively increased from 5 cycles of 5 min of 10% oxygen and 4 min reoxygenation on day one to the maximum of 7 cycles of 10 min hypoxia and 4 min reoxygenation on days 11–20. On day 21 dogs were anesthetized, the right heart exposed and a microdialysis probe was inserted into the SA node. Increasing doses (5 fmol‐1.5 nmol/min) of the DOR agonist methionine‐enkephalin‐arg‐phe (MEAP) were introduced by microdialysis. The right vagus was stimulated at each dose to evaluate the influence and mix of prejunctional DORs. Prior to the dose response, vagally mediated declines in heart rate were exaggerated by ~ 20% in IHC vs. sham and non‐conditioned animals. MEAP generated a clear DOR‐2 mediated vagolytic effect in the control animals that appeared at the midpoint of the dose response curve. This robust vagolytic response was completely absent in the IHC animals. Thus, IHC may exert its cardioprotective influence by increasing vagal transmission and shifting the cardiac DOR receptors to favor the vagotonic DOR‐1 phenotype at the expense of the vagolytic DOR‐2.","",""

Transient elevations of [Ca2+]cyt were observed in response to glutamic acid (Glu), ATP, and aluminum (Al3+). Each chemical induced a [Ca2+]cyt signature that differed among the three treatments in regard to the onset, duration, and shape of the response. Glu and ATP triggered patterns of [Ca2+]cyt increases that were similar among the different root zones, whereas Al3+ evoked [Ca2+]cyt transients that had monophasic and biphasic shapes, most notably in the root transition zone. The Al3+-induced [Ca2+]cyt increases generally started in the maturation zone and propagated toward the cap, while the earliest [Ca2+]cyt response after Glu or ATP treatment occurred in an area that encompassed the meristem and elongation zone. The biphasic [Ca2+]cyt signature resulting from Al3+ treatment originated mostly from cortical cells located at 300 to 500 μ m from the root tip, which could be triggered in part through ligand-gated Glu receptors. Lanthanum and gadolinium, cations commonly used as Ca2+ channel blockers, elicited [Ca2+]cyt responses similar to those induced by Al3+. The trivalent ion-induced [Ca2+]cyt signatures in roots of an Al3+-resistant and an Al3+-sensitive mutant were similar to those of wild-type plants, indicating that the early [Ca2+]cyt changes we report here may not be tightly linked to Al3+ toxicity but rather to a general response to trivalent cations.","http://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-pdf/152/3/1442/37117664/plphys_v152_3_1442.pdf",""

We hypothesize that variability in trial results may be due in part to heterogeneous properties of beta-blockers. First, we propose that the extent of beta-blocker metabolism by cytochrome P-450 and the time available to titrate the dosage before surgery (titration time) may interact; dependence on P-450 may be most harmful when titration time is short. Second, beta-blockers vary in their selectivity for the beta-1 receptor and reduced selectivity may contribute to cerebral ischemia. Methods: We used meta-analysis and meta-regression of existing trials to explore the role of these pharmacological properties. Results: We found that both of these pharmacological factors are significantly associated with reduced efficacy of beta-blockers. Conclusions: Pharmacological properties of beta-blockers may contribute to heterogeneous trial results. Many trials have used metoprolol, which is extensively metabolized by cytochrome P450 and is less selective for the beta-1 receptor. For these two reasons, the efficacy of metoprolol to prevent perioperative cardiac complications should be compared with the efficacy of other beta-blockers.","http://pubs.asahq.org/anesthesiology/article-pdf/113/3/585/452082/0000542-201009000-00019.pdf",""

First, it includes additional years of data from police agencies receiving federal funding to examine the effects of additional resources on arrests. Second, making use of the two waves of census data (1990 and 2000) allowed time-varying analysis of the relationship between police arrests and demographics. Finally, a hierarchical statistical method for longitudinal analysis (HMLM) was used in the analysis of police arrest data from 5,871 cities during 1993 and 2000 when the involvement of federal government for promoting community policing or quality of life policing was unprecedented. Our primary findings suggest a positive relationship between COPS hiring grants and all four types of police arrests during the period of study though COPS funding usually accounted for only a small percentage of the total budget in a police department (GAO, 2005). More specifically, the hiring grant, the largest part of the COPS funding project, had consistently significant impact on police arrests after controlling for the socioeconomic variables and crimes. In addition, the hiring grant was significant predictor of all four categories of arrests, indicating that additional manpower did have a direct casual relationship with number of police arrests.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0734016810391902",""

SAM maintenance requires the coordinated equilibrium between stem cell division and differentiation and is regulated by integrated networks of gene expression, hormonal signaling, and metabolite sensing. Here, we show that the maize (Zea mays) mutant bladekiller1-R (blk1-R) is defective in leaf blade development and meristem maintenance and exhibits a progressive reduction in SAM size that results in premature shoot abortion. Molecular markers for stem cell maintenance and organ initiation reveal that both of these meristematic functions are progressively compromised in blk1-R mutants, especially in the inflorescence and floral meristems. Positional cloning of blk1-R identified a predicted missense mutation in a highly conserved amino acid encoded by thiamine biosynthesis2 (thi2). Consistent with chromosome dosage studies suggesting that blk1-R is a null mutation, biochemical analyses confirm that the wild-type THI2 enzyme copurifies with a thiazole precursor to thiamine, whereas the mutant enzyme does not. Heterologous expression studies confirm that THI2 is targeted to chloroplasts. All blk1-R mutant phenotypes are rescued by exogenous thiamine supplementation, suggesting that blk1-R is a thiamine auxotroph. These results provide insight into the role of metabolic cofactors, such as thiamine, during the proliferation of stem and initial cell populations.","http://academic.oup.com/plcell/article-pdf/22/10/3305/36932387/plcell_v22_10_3305.pdf",""

The presence of homologous proteins among animal or plant foods and between foods and certain airborne allergens may account for cross-sensitization that may be clinically relevant. For inpatients or outpatients with food allergies, nutrient and fluid requirements are the same as for individuals without food allergies. Since patients with adverse reactions to food may self-restrict intake or have been counseled on food avoidance, it is particularly important to determine dietary adequacy and to provide patients with appropriate food substitutions to provide nutrients that may be missing from a patient’s diet.

We tested the hypothesis that perinatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) that disrupt hormonal pathways would perturb reproductive maturation and the sexually dimorphic development of neuroendocrine systems in the preoptic area (POA). Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were injected on gestational d 16 and 18 with vehicle (dimethylsulfoxide), Aroclor 1221 (A1221, an estrogenic PCB mix), a reconstituted PCB mixture representing those highest in human body burden (PCBs 138, 153, 180), or estradiol benzoate, an estrogenic control.

In adulthood, some rats were perfused and used for immunohistochemistry of estrogen receptor α, kisspeptin, and coexpression of Fos in GnRH neurons. Other rats were used to obtain fresh-frozen POA dissections for use in a PCR-based 48-gene expression array. Pubertal onset was advanced and estrous cyclicity irregular in endocrine-disrupted females. Furthermore, sexual differentiation of female neuroendocrine systems was masculinized/defeminized. Specifically, in the adult female anteroventral periventricular nucleus, estrogen receptor α-cell numbers and kisspeptin fiber density were significantly decreased, as was GnRH-Fos coexpression. PCR analysis identified androgen receptor, IGF-I, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit NR2b, and TGFβ1 mRNAs as significantly down-regulated in endocrine-disrupted female POAs.

The methodology proposed in this paper allows varied length multivariate data to be combined and analyzed in an integrated framework through a “Composite Likelihood Approach.” The method employs copula‐based multivariate distributions in order to provide necessary flexibility of admitting arbitrary marginals. The paper presents the theoretical basis of the approach and highlights its advantages through two applications. A significant reduction in uncertainty in design flood quantiles of a relatively shorter flood series is achieved by utilizing an associated downstream flood data. The advantage of the methodology is further demonstrated by establishing significant information gain for six different combinations of Gaussian and non‐Gaussian marginals. The proposed approach marks a paradigm shift in hydrologic design procedures, particularly for partially gauged basins, wherein a higher precision in hydrologic designs is achieved by leveraging associated information that has hitherto remained unutilized. It is opined that the approach will enable offsetting the impact of dwindling hydrological observation networks around the world by enhancing information that is derivable from existing networks.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2009WR008490",""

The disease is most noticeable in the field as water-soaked lesions on lupine pods that produce an abundance of whitish-colored ooze with a sticky and foamy consistency. As the disease progresses, yellowing of lupine plants occurs with ooze characteristically dripping down the infected pods and stems and solidifying. A gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium with facultative anaerobic growth was repeatedly isolated from infected lupine tissues, and subsequently confirmed by Koch's postulates to infect lupines. Physiological and biochemical tests, including the API 20E and 50CHE strip assays, showed a highly uniform phenotype for the lupine strains that was distinctive for the genus Brenneria and most closely resembled the oak pathogen Brenneria quercina.

This work consists of using X‐rays and visualization techniques to map the distribution of immiscible fluids, particularly trapped oil clusters, residing in a glass bead pack subject to different flow conditions. We analyze the effect of flowing conditions on the evolution of fluid microstructures using X‐ray microtomography. Spherical glass beads (0.425–0.600 mm in diameter), a water‐wet porous medium, were packed inside a specially designed core holder. High‐resolution imaging provides detailed mapping of pore structures resulting from bead packing, and characterization of fluid microstructures formed during sequential water and oil injections. We present spatial distribution of trapped oil clusters for the entire bead pack, as well as mechanistic explanations leading to the fluid configurations observed.

We begin by examining the excess entropy, the key quantity used to correlate dynamic properties within entropy scaling strategies. We compute the thermodynamic excess entropy as well as contributions to the two-body excess entropy stemming from translational and orientational intermolecular correlations. Our results indicate that the total two-body contribution accounts for more than 70% of the thermodynamic excess entropy at all state conditions explored. For the two dumbbell models studied here, the orientational component of the two-body excess entropy dominates at moderate and high fluid densities. We next investigate the relationships between kinetic properties and various contributions to the excess entropy. Four dynamic properties are considered: translational and rotational diffusivities, a characteristic relaxation time for rotational motion, and a collective relaxation time stemming from analysis of the coherent intermediate-scattering function. We find that the thermodynamic excess entropy provides the best metric for describing kinetic properties. For each of the dynamic properties considered, reduced data collapse onto a common curve when expressed as a function of the thermodynamic excess entropy. The likelihood of a two-body contribution to the excess entropy serving as a reliable scaling variable is linked to the extent to which it correlates with the thermodynamic excess entropy. The total two-body term contributes significantly to the excess entropy, and therefore this quantity generally serves as a suitable scaling variable.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.3477767/15431718/104506_1_online.pdf",""

Low or high (0.5 or 2 mM) Ca in media containing individual or mixture of ALA (8.75–50 μM; n‐6/n‐3=4/1) and CLA isomers (20 μM of c9, t11/t10, c12‐CLAs; 80/10, 90/10, 90/5% respectively) were treated for 6 days (triplicate). Cell proliferation was determined by resazurin salt solution, and florescence was measured at 590 nm. ST2 and 3T3‐E1 cell proliferation was higher at 0.5 mM and lower at 2 mM Ca; Reversed was true for 3T3‐L1 cells (p<0.05). At both Ca levels, individual or mixture of ALA and CLA did not affect 3T3‐L1 cells. In ST2 cells, the effect of ALA was lowered by adding CLA (80/10; 90/10) at 0.5 mM Ca, whereas at 2 mM Ca, ALA+CLA (80/10) further enhanced proliferation. In 3T3‐E1 cells, even though ALA significantly increased proliferation at 0.5mM Ca, its effect was markedly lowered by addition of CLA at all combinations/both Ca levels. Overall, providing high Ca may reduce adipogenesis, but enhance osteoblastogenesis. In a proliferative stage, a synergistic effect among Ca, ALA and CLA on bone/fat cell may not be substantial, but is significant in increasing progenitor stromal cell formation.

The scorecard assesses drilling operations and technologies with respect to air, site, water, waste management, biodiversity and societal issues. Low impact operations reduce the environmental footprint of operations by the adoption of new methods to use in (1) getting materials to and from the rig site (site access), (2) reducing the rig site area, (3) using alternative drilling rig power management systems, and (4) adopting waste management at the rig site. The scorecard enables a dialog to be established and maintained among all interested, concerned and affected stakeholders. In this manner, the industry has a new way of seeing itself within the larger network. The scorecard that will be presented in the paper provides the means to demonstrate the connectivity between energy production and the affected ecosystem. The Houston Advanced Research Center (HARC) is leading a consortium effort to investigate the development of low impact drilling systems. The work originated in 2005 and funding was obtained by the U.S. Department of Energy for 2006 – 2009. Additional funding for the effort was obtained through the Research Partnership to Secure Energy for America (RPSEA), industry and environmental organizations. The goal of this project is to reduce the environmental impact of rig operations through integration of low-impact site access and site operations. The paper discusses the scorecard that is being developed. The scorecard methodology presents an ecological understanding of the tradeoffs associated with producing energy. The scorecard methodology was developed through a series of workshops being held with ecologists, botanists, wildlife management experts and others in addition to oil and gas industry experts.","http://onepetro.org/SPEURCC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/137430-MS/1752696/spe-137430-ms.pdf",""

However, could this predisposition be resolved in practice without harming federal employees’ rights, benefits, and morale in the workplace? To address this question, this article examines whether the attitudes of federal employees toward variants of subjective discrimination in the workplace changed significantly during the George W. Bush presidency. We find that trends related to perceptions of retaliation and discrimination have improved in recent years. However, perceptions of retaliation and discrimination are found to exist among minority and female employees and managers in the federal workplace that require vigilance. These results suggest that big government conservatism’s predisposition to pursue equal opportunity as opposed to affirmative action—while diminishing the power of public employee unions and enhancing managerial prerogatives—either succeeded on its own merits or that the earlier momentum could not be stopped.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0734371X10381486",""

There is, however, a substantial body of research that finds that extralegal factors such as a defendant’s sex also influence these outcomes. Most of these latter studies conclude that female defendants receive less severe outcomes compared to their male counterparts. Most of this research, however, is limited to Western societies. To extend this body of research, the current study examines sex differences in sentencing practices for a sample of narcotics offenders in South Korea. Results support previous research; female drug offenders in South Korea are generally treated more leniently than their male counterparts. Tests for interaction effects reveal that the defendant’s sex also interacts with other constellations of factors to produce lenient treatment for certain female defendants. These tests, however, also reveal that lenient sentence outcomes are not extended to all female defendants; those with prior drug convictions do not fare better than their male counterparts at the incarceration decision.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0306624X09360966",""

In these applications, it is necessary to control and remove alloy impurities and inclusions. Cleaning and fluxing processes are widely used during processing of the alloys for removal of inclusions, hydrogen and excess of magnesium. These processes use salt fluxes based in the system NaCl—KCl, injection of chlorine or mixture of chlorine with an inert gas. The new systems include a graphite wand and a circulation device to force convection in the melt and permit the bubbling and dispersion of reactive and cleaning agents. This paper discusses the recycling of aluminium alloys in rotary and reverberatory industrial furnaces. It focuses on the removal of magnesium during the melting process. In rotary furnaces, the magnesium lost is mainly due to the oxidation process at high temperatures. The magnesium removal is carried out by the reaction between chlorine and magnesium, with its efficiency associated to kinetic factors such as concentration of magnesium, mixing, and temperature. These factors are also related to emissions generated during the demagging process. Improvements in the metallic yield can be reached in rotary furnaces if the process starts with a proper salt, with limits of addition, and avoiding long holding times. To improve throughput in reverberatories, start the charging with high magnesium content material and inject chlorine gas if the molten metal is at the right temperature. Removal of magnesium through modern technologies can be efficiently performed to prevent environmental problems.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0734242X10381413",""

Intragranular porosity may also contribute to the “slow sorption” phenomenon. Intragranular pores may be sparsely interconnected, raising the possibility that accessible porosity and diffusive exchange are limited by pore connectivity. We used a pore‐scale network model to examine pore connectivity effects on accessible porosity, tortuosity, and diffusivity in spherical particles. The diffusive process simulated was release of a nonsorbing solute initially at equilibrium with the surrounding solution. High‐connectivity results were essentially identical to Crank's analytical solution. Low‐connectivity results were consistent with observations reported in the literature, with solute released at early times more quickly than indicated by the analytical solution, and more slowly at late times. Values of accessible porosity, tortuosity, and diffusivity scaled with connection probability, distance to the sphere's exterior, and/or the sphere's radius, as predicted by percolation theory. When integrated into a conventional finite difference model, the scaling relationships provide a consistent and physically sound way to incorporate such nonuniformities into models of intragranular diffusion.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2009WR008183",""

In this study, a novel kernel-based machine learning method, the Gaussian processes (GPs) model, was proposed to perform short-term traffic flow forecasting. This GP model was evaluated and compared with SVMs and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models based on four sets of traffic volume data collected from three interstate highways in Seattle, Washington. The comparative results showed that the GP and SVM models consistently outperformed the ARIMA model. This study also showed that because the GP model is formulated in a full Bayesian framework, it can allow for explicit probabilistic interpretation of forecasting outputs. This capacity gives the GP an advantage over SVMs to model and forecast traffic flow.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/2165-08",""

It utilizes the statewide administrative data set on public school teachers in Florida during the period 1997–2003 in conjunction with the 1999–2000 Schools and Staffing Survey and its Teacher Follow-Up Survey (SASS-TFS) data set. The SASS-TFS illustrates the possible misclassification of teachers in certain state administrative databases. Results suggest that new teachers in Florida and elsewhere usually teach in more challenging schools and have more disadvantaged children in their classrooms than teachers with more years of experience. Within-school classroom assignments play an important role in teacher mobility decisions. Specifically, school-specific policies on reducing disciplinary problems and possible strategic deployment of teachers in different classrooms may be effective in increasing school-level teacher retention rates.","https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/EDFP_a_00002",""

Additionally, more complicated effects are associated with internal waves that are curved and/or truncated. In this talk, observations of internal waves measured on the New Jersey shelf area of the north Atlantic and their effects on the acoustic field are presented. During the experiment, a low-frequency source broadcasting continuous tone was towed repeatedly out and back along radials with respect to a VLA. The ship’s track was oriented parallel to the shelf break so that the acoustic propagation path was roughly aligned with internal waves propagating up the shelf. Internal waves were measured at the location of the receivers by temperature sensors on the VLA, at the location of the source by a towed CTD chain, as well as by a cluster of 16 environmental moorings located adjacent to experiment site. The high-spatial sampling of the environment allows for identification of range-varying features of internal waves.","https://pubs.aip.org/jasa/article/127/3_Supplement/1974/633427/Propagation-of-low-frequency-sound-through-densely",""

From a literature review, several nondestructive testing methods are compared for applicability to void inspection in external tendons. The impact echo, ultrasonic pulse velocity, and sounding inspection methods are then selected and assessed for further preliminary testing. The sounding inspection method is further assessed for its effectiveness in identifying voids in a full-scale, external tendon system. The results indicate that sounding inspection slightly underestimates the size of the voids. However, the inspected size and locations of voids have a close correlation with actual voids in ducts.

Rad4 was known previously only as a key repair factor that directly recognizes DNA damage and initiates DNA repair. Our results, however, reveal a novel function of Rad4. We found that Rad4 and Rad23 share several common substrates. Substrates in rad4Δ cells are ubiquitylated, indicating that Rad4 regulates a postubiquitylation event. Moreover, we found that Rad4 participates in the Rad23–Ufd2 pathway, but not the Rad23-Png1 pathway, consistent with previous findings that Png1 and Rad4 or Ufd2 form separate Rad23 complexes. The Rad4-binding domain is crucial for the functioning of Rad23 in degradation, suggesting that Rad4 and Rad23 work together in proteolysis. It is interesting to note that upon DNA damage, Rad4 becomes concentrated in the nucleus and degradation of the nonnuclear protein Pex29 is compromised, further suggesting that Rad4 may influence the coordination of various cellular processes. Our findings will help to unravel the detailed mechanisms underlying the roles of Rad23 and Rad4 in proteolysis and also the interplay between DNA repair and proteolysis.","",""

Corrosion of the strands was observed in these voids, which are believed to be a result of poor grouting. Corrosion of the PT strands can result in structural failure. Controversy exists on how best to protect PT tendons from corrosion; filling these voids with grout is one option. An optimized grouting procedure for repairing these voids is needed to protect the strands from corrosive environments. This research investigates three grouting methods for efficiently repairing the voids in PT duct systems: vacuum grouting (VG), pressure grouting (PG), and pressure–vacuum grouting (PVG). Each method is evaluated for filling capability, filling performance, and economic feasibility. Also, three prepackaged grouts for repair are assessed in this research to propose the most suitable material for repairing voids in the PT ducts. The results indicate that the PG and PVG methods are more constructible and likely to be more economical than the VG method. However, the PVG and VG methods seem to be more effective than the PG method in filling the voids. As a result of these tests, the PVG method is recommended for filling voids in tendons. The results also show that Classes C-1 and C-2 grouts have better filling capability than Class C-3 grout.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/2172-01",""

These psychological states in turn drive affective commitment and turnover intentions, two variables of continued interest to researchers and managers. The authors test this model empirically using data from 3,999 employees of a health care service system. The findings provide support for the hypothesized model rather than an alternative and shed light on an important tool for internal marketing. Besides suggesting avenues for future research, such as refining the concept of employee engagement and uncovering the antecedents of employees’ perceptions of mission fulfillment, this study demonstrates the importance of exploring the psychological processes that comprise the mechanisms by which contextual variables affect key outcomes. For managers, the results imply the importance of aligning an organization’s actions with its stated mission, given that employees are attuned to and affected by such an alignment.

Since domestic dogs are known to develop medical conditions associated with atypical CF in humans (e.g., bronchiectasis and pancreatitis), we hypothesized that dogs with these disorders likely have a higher expression rate of CFTR mutations than the at-large population. Temporal temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) was used to screen canine CFTR in 400 animals: 203 dogs diagnosed with pancreatitis, 23 dogs diagnosed with bronchiectasis, and 174 dogs admitted to clinics for any illness (at-large dogs). Twenty-eight dogs were identified with one of four CFTR missense mutations. P1281T and P1464H mutations occur in relatively unconserved residues. R1456W is analogous to the human R1453W mutation, which has ∼20% of normal CFTR function and is associated with pancreatitis and panbronchiolitis. R812W disrupts a highly conserved protein kinase A recognition site within the regulatory domain.

We have considered the possibility that the inclusion of cases of transient hypothyroidism has inflated the reported incidence rate of CH. Assessing the effects of cases of transient hypothyroidism on the incidence rate is problematic, because the definitions, diagnostic criteria, and differentiation from transient hyperthyrotropinemia vary widely among state newborn screening programs. Among the 4 etiologies for transient hypothyroidism (maternal thyrotropin receptor–blocking antibodies, exposure to maternal antithyroid medications, iodine deficiency, and iodine excess), there is little evidence of increases in the incidence rate from thyrotropin receptor–blocking antibodies. Exposure to antithyroid drugs could contribute significantly to the incidence rate of transient CH, given the high estimated incidence of active maternal hyperthyroidism. Iodine deficiency or excess in the United States seems unlikely to have contributed significantly to the incidence rate of CH, because the secular trend toward lower iodine intake among women of reproductive age in the 1980s and 1990s seems to have plateaued, and perinatal iodine exposure has presumably declined as a result of recommendations to discontinue using iodine-containing disinfectants. Although the female-to-male sex ratio among newborns with thyroid agenesis or dysgenesis (the most common causes of CH) is typically 2:1, analysis of the sex ratio of newborns diagnosed with presumed CH in the United States suggests that a substantial proportion might have transient hypothyroidism or hyperthyrotropinemia, because the sex ratio has been well below the expected 2:1 ratio. Combined ultrasonography and 123I scintigraphy of the thyroid gland are effective tools for identifying cases of thyroid agenesis and dysgenesis and can help to differentiate cases of transient hypothyroidism from true CH. Imaging is also a vital component in evaluating children who, at 3 years of age, undergo a trial of discontinuation of levothyroxine treatment to test for persistence of hypothyroidism. Ultimately, thyroid gland imaging, in conjunction with long-term follow-up studies that appropriately assess and report whether there was permanence of hypothyroidism, will be necessary to address the true incidence rate of CH and any contribution to the observed rate by transient cases of hypothyroidism or hyperthyrotropinemia.","https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-pdf/125/Supplement_2/S54/891682/zpe10510000s54.pdf",""

This paper introduces transactional value theory in the context of channel-structure research and integrates it with transaction cost theory to generate a trade value framework. The trade value framework considers channel-structure decisions from the perspectives of both buyers and sellers and is used to analyze the impact of web-based e-commerce on intermediated channel-structures. The proposed framework suggests that intermediaries function best in a channel-structure if they can reduce trade-inhibiting factors and improve trade-enhancing factors. Intermediaries may also prosper if they deliver extraordinary value on one side of the trade value framework to the point that inhibiting factors on the other end of the trade can be overlooked. Intermediaries maximize the value of the trade for both the buyers and the sellers by trading through an intermediated channel-structure as opposed to trading directly.</p>","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=42136",""

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) is an ongoing multicenter clinical trial examining the effects of weight loss achieved through ILI on cardiovascular events and overall mortality in obese/overweight adults with type 2 diabetes. We report on 1,759 Look AHEAD participants who had hs-CRP and fitness data at baseline and 1 year. Subjects were randomly assigned to ILI or to usual care (diabetes support and education [DSE]). ILI involved frequent counseling to increase moderate-intensity exercise to 175 min/week, reduce caloric and saturated fat intake, and change macronutrient composition to improve glycemic control. RESULTS: ILI reduced median hs-CRP by 43.6% from baseline to 1 year, compared with a 16.7% reduction with DSE (P &lt; 0.001). ILI decreased weight (8.8%), A1C (0.7%), and triglycerides (17%) and increased fitness (19%) and HDL cholesterol (7.5%) (P &lt; 0.0001 vs. changes with DSE). Changes in adiposity and glucose control with ILI remained independent predictors of hs-CRP change at 1 year (P &lt; 0.0001 for each) after adjustment for demographics, smoking, cardiovascular history, statin and thiazolidinedione use, and changes in fitness and lipid control. Neither statin nor insulin therapy modified the association between ILI and hs-CRP. CONCLUSIONS: A 1-year lifestyle intervention for weight loss in obese individuals with diabetes was associated with substantial reductions in hs-CRP. Improved glycemic control and reduced adiposity had comparable effects on hs-CRP change.","https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/33/11/2297/604867/zdc01110002297.pdf",""

However, while the dynamics of cholesterol efflux from both the plasma membrane and lipid droplets have been studied, less is known regarding the efflux of sphingomyelin from these membranes. In order to address this issue, sphingomyelin efflux kinetics and binding affinities from different intracellular pools were examined. When compared to the plasma membrane, lipid droplets had a smaller exchangeable sphingomyelin efflux pool and the time required to efflux that pool was significantly shorter. Fluorescence binding assays revealed that proteins in the plasma membrane and lipid droplet pool bound sphingomyelin with high affinity.

Measurements were made along three radials, separated by 45 deg, with each track repeatedly traversed over a period of 6–10 h. Concurrently with the acoustic measurements, the water column sound speed field was estimated both along the source track and at the receiver location. The objective was to fully characterize the environment in the water column over the acoustic path during transmissions. In this way, variability in the acoustic field measured along the repeated tracks could be associated with variability in the water column. The variability in the water column, measured independently at the source and at the receiver, is examined and related to variability observed in the acoustic fields. Spatial and temporal variability is characterized on transect-to-transect, radial-to-radial, and day-to-day basis. Over 3 days, variability in the water column could be attributed to thermohaline intrusions, linear and non-linear internal waves, as well as mesoscale variability. This talk will focus on the requirements for characterizing these features and understanding their impact on acoustic propagation and prediction.

T cell help is required for anti-F8 inhibitor formation, however, the role of secreted cytokines is not yet fully understood. To ascertain the T cell cytokines important in the development of inhibitor Abs, F8-deficient mice were immunized 4x with 2μg recombinant human F8 at weekly intervals. To abate the production of inhibitor Ab, mice were intranasally immunized with 100μg of E. coli colony-forming antigen I (CFA/I), a novel tolerogen which reduces inflammatory immune responses. Plasma was assayed for the presence of secreted cytokines via multiplex and for functional anti-F8 Ab via Bethesda assay. Inhibitor Ab was detectable by day 14 post-primary immunization, and Th1 (IFNγ and IL-12), Th2 (IL-4), and Th17 (IL-17) cytokines were present in control and CFA/I treated plasma as early as 7 days post-primary immunization. There was no apparent correlation between Th1 vs Th2 responses and increased inhibitor titer. However, mice that were resistant to the effects of CFA/I treatment displayed increased anti-F8 Ab as well as IL-6 and IL-17 by day 21 post-primary immunization. In contrast, IL-13 secretion was associated with significantly decreased inhibitor antibody in CFA/I treated mice. Our results suggest that modification of Th cytokine response may amerliorate inhibitor Ab formation.","https://journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article/184/1_Supplement/87.27/47200/Effects-of-a-novel-mucosal-tolerogen-on-critical-T",""

This limitation in research is especially evident in studies of non-Western countries. Using longitudinal data on 2,817 South Korean youth, the current study attempts to fill the gaps by examining whether general strain theory can explain school bullying. As the theory suggests, youth who experience victimization by peers and conflict with parents are more likely to engage in bullying. However, there is limited evidence of the expected interaction effects between strains and conditioning factors. Inconsistent with general strain theory, parental attachment and positive relationships with teachers do not condition the effects of strains, and anger is not a mediating variable.

The assumptions and logic of these quests have become less relevant in increasingly complex adaptive business systems (CABS), where the competitive performance landscapes of products and services are highly dynamic and co-evolve. We revise the strategic alignment quest to propose a co-evolution quest that addresses not only competitive strategy questions of a firm but also corporate strategy questions. The co-evolution quest seeks to increase a firm's agility and dynamism in repositioning itself, identifying profitable product-market positions as the evolving competitive landscape erodes the profitability of the firm's existing positions. To support the co-evolution quest, we revise the integration quest and propose a reconfiguration quest that encompasses not only business processes but also products and services, as well as the contracts, resources, and transactions associated with them. As the firm makes repositioning moves to co-evolve with the competitive landscape, the reconfiguration quest seeks to increase the firm's agility in disintegrating its existing nexus of contracts, resources, and transactions that support the old positions and in reconfiguring new ones that support the new positions. Finally, we revise the sustained competitive advantage quest to propose a renewal quest that recognizes the temporary nature of competitive advantage in CABS. The renewal quest seeks to destabilize the firm's old sources of competitive advantage when competitive dynamics erode their utility, rapidly create new sources of competitive advantage, and concatenate a series of temporary advantages over time. The three reframed quests provide the foundation for a research agenda on IS strategy in CABS.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/isre.1100.0317",""

Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the concurrent, discriminative, and predictive validity of the FGA in community-dwelling older adults. Design: This was a prospective cohort study. Methods: Thirty-five older adults aged 60 to 90 years completed the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Dynamic Gait Index (DGI), Timed “Up & Go” Test (TUG), and Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) during one session. Falls were tracked by having participants complete a monthly fall calendar for 6 months. Spearman correlation coefficients were used to determine concurrent validity among the ABC, BBS, TUG, DGI, and FGA. To determine the optimum scores to classify fall risk, sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), and positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR−) were calculated for the FGA in classifying fall risk based on the published criterion scores of the DGI and TUG and for the FGA, TUG, and DGI in identifying prospective falls. Receiver operator curves with area under the curve were used to determine the effectiveness of the FGA in classifying fall risk and of the DGI, TUG, and FGA in identifying prospective falls. Results: The FGA correlated with the ABC (r=.053, P&lt;.001), BBS (r=.84, P&lt;.001), and TUG (r=−.84, P&lt;.001). An FGA score of ≤22/30 provides both discriminative and predictive validity. The FGA (scores ≤22/30) provided 100% Sn, 72% Sp, LR+ of 3.6, and LR− of 0 to predict prospective falls. Limitations: The study was limited by the length of time of follow-up and the small sample size that did not allow for evaluation of criterion scores by decade. Conclusions: The FGA with a cutoff score of 22/30 is effective in classifying fall risk in older adults and predicting unexplained falls in community-dwelling older adults.","http://academic.oup.com/ptj/article-pdf/90/5/761/31661836/ptj0761.pdf",""

However, recent studies also suggest low-level myoglobin expression in various non-muscle tissues. Prior studies incorporating molecular, pharmacological, physiological and transgenic technologies have demonstrated that myoglobin is an essential oxygen-storage hemoprotein capable of facilitating oxygen transport and modulating nitric oxide homeostasis within cardiac and skeletal myocytes. Concomitant with these studies, scientific investigations into the transcriptional regulation of myoglobin expression have been undertaken. These studies have indicated that activation of key transcription factors (MEF2, NFAT and Sp1) and co-activators (PGC-1α) by locomotor activity, differential intracellular calcium fluxes and low intracellular oxygen tension collectively regulate myoglobin expression. Future studies focused on tissue-specific transcriptional regulatory pathways and post-translational modifications governing myoglobin expression will need to be undertaken. Finally, further studies investigating the modulation of myoglobin expression under various myopathic processes may identify myoglobin as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of various cardiac and skeletal myopathies.","http://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article-pdf/213/16/2741/1428533/2741.pdf",""

While a variety of initial successes are reported, significantly more research is possible to extend the capabilities of TCM for the reported cutting processes as well as for many other manufacturing processes.

Space-time analysis has always been important in studying fertility transitions, for example. However, demographers have seldom used formal statistical methods to describe and analyze time series of maps. One formal method, used widely in epidemiology, criminology, and public health, is Knox’s space-time interaction test. In this article, we discuss the potential of the Knox test in demographic research and note some possible pitfalls. We demonstrate how to use familiar proportional hazards models to adapt the Knox test for demographic applications. These adaptations allow for nonrepeatable events and for the incorporation of structural variables that change in space and time. We apply the modified test to data on the onset of fertility decline in Brazil over 1960–2000 and show how the modified method can produce maps indicating where and when diffusion effects seem strongest, net of covariate effects.","http://read.dukeupress.edu/demography/article-pdf/47/3/629/880288/629schmertmann.pdf",""

However, prolonged or extensive exposure can lead to neurodegeneration. Two important functions of S100B in this regard, are its role in the development and plasticity of the serotonergic neurotransmitter system, and its role in the cascade of glial changes associated with neuroinflammation. Both of these processes are therefore accelerated towards degeneration in disease processes wherein S100B is increased, notably, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down syndrome (DS). In order to study the role of S100B in this context, we have examined S100B overexpressing transgenic mice. Similar to AD and DS, the transgenic animals show a profound change in serotonin innervation. By 28 weeks of age, there is a significant loss of terminals in the hippocampus. Similarly, the transgenic animals show neuroinflammatory changes analogous with AD and DS. These include decreased numbers of mature, stable astroglial cells, increased numbers of activated microglial cells and increased microglial expression of the cell surface receptor RAGE. Eventually, the S100B transgenic animals show neurodegeneration and the appearance of hyperphosphorylated tau structures, as seen in late stage DS and AD.

Disinhibited behavior is presumed to occur when attention is directed toward salient provocative or instigatory cues rather than inhibitory cues. AMM research is reviewed with regard to stress and anxiety, risky sexual behavior, drinking and driving, suicide, disinhibited eating, smoking, and alcohol-related aggression. The AMM is also expanded by proposing five key mechanisms (i.e., negative affect, angry affect, hostile cognitive rumination, self-awareness, and empathy) that are likely to explain how the model is specifically involved in the alcohol-aggression relation.

We find that although infection rates and predicted case loads are somewhat different between the AB and GM models, several epidemiological parameters, e.g. mean immunity in the population and mean dose received, behave similarly across the methods. Further, through a comparison of our dose-dependent replication model against two control models that uncouple dose-dependent replication from transmission, we find that host immunity in a population after an epidemic is qualitatively different than when transmission depends on time-varying viral abundances within hosts.

A new measure of possibility for events whose probability is not well measurably different from zero is proposed and illustrated in the context of possible release of hazardous material from a high containment research laboratory and in the context of large insurance company failures.

Though useful, these studies have not provided injury profiles of all occupants in crash-involved vehicles. This lack of a comprehensive picture has limited the ability to devise measures that enhance the safety and reduce the severity of the injury sustained by all vehicular occupants. Moreover, such studies ignore the possible presence of correlated, unobserved factors that may simultaneously affect the injury severity levels of multiple occupants. This paper aims to fill the gap by presenting a simultaneous model of injury severity to apply to crashes that involve any number of occupants. A copula-based methodology, which could be used to estimate such complex model systems, was applied to a data set of crashes drawn from the 2007 General Estimates System in the United States. The model estimation results provide strong evidence of the presence of correlated unobserved factors that affect injury severity levels of vehicle occupants. The correlation exhibited heterogeneity across vehicle types, with a greater level of interoccupant dependency in heavy SUVs and pickup trucks. The study also sheds light on how numerous exogenous factors—including occupant, vehicle, and crash characteristics; environmental factors; and roadway attributes—affect the injury severity levels of occupants in different seat positions. The findings confirm that rear-seat passengers are less vulnerable to severe injuries than front-row passengers and point to the need to enhance vehicular design features that promote front-row occupant safety.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/2165-01",""

MicroRNA-199a-3p (miR-199a-3p) is downregulated in several human malignancies including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we show that miR-199a-3p targets mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and c-Met in HCC cells. Restoring attenuated levels of miR-199a-3p in HCC cells led to G1-phase cell cycle arrest, reduced invasive capability, enhanced susceptibility to hypoxia, and increased sensitivity to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. These in vitro findings were confirmed by an analysis of human HCC tissues, which revealed an inverse correlation linking miR-199a-3p and mTOR as well as a shorter time to recurrence after HCC resection in patients with lower miR-199a-3p expression. These results suggest that tactics to regulate mTOR and c-Met by elevating levels of miR-199a-3p may have therapeutic benefits in highly lethal cancers such as HCC.

One possible mechanism of sex differences in behavior is a sexual dimorphism in the relay of sensory information to motor areas, but no studies have examined the role of such a relay in vertebrate sexually dimorphic behaviors. We used egr-1 expression as a marker of neural activation in frogs exposed to conspecific and heterospecific acoustic signals to compare activation patterns throughout the brains of males and females. We determined how the sexes differ in the transformation of social signals into motor responses in the context of social communication. We examined the relationships between egr-1 mRNA levels in the auditory midbrain and forebrain areas, as well as how forebrain expression related to the behavioral responses of the animals. Forebrain network activation patterns and forebrain–behavior relationships were similar in males and females. By contrast, we found a sex difference in the relationship between midbrain and forebrain activation; midbrain auditory responses predicted forebrain responses in females but not in males. This sex difference suggests that sensory inputs differentially regulate motor systems underlying social behaviors in males and females. This sensorimotor transformation may be a common locus for generating sex differences in behavior.","http://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article-pdf/213/20/3463/1271281/3463.pdf",""

Precast, prestressed concrete plants require that the concrete used to fabricate their structural members attain high early strength. High early-strength SCC could provide significant value for precast plants. However, the high early-strength SCC mixture constituents, proportions, and construction may affect the hardened properties, and SCC may not provide the same performance as conventional concrete. SCC and conventional concrete mixture proportions designed for precast, prestressed bridge elements were evaluated to characterize the associated mechanical properties, shear characteristics, bond characteristics, and creep. To assess the applicability of SCC in prestressed girder systems, four full-scale girder–deck systems containing conventional concrete and SCC precast girders were fabricated and tested. Results from this research indicate that the AASHTO Load and Resistance Factor Design Specifications can be used to estimate the mechanical properties of high early-strength SCC. With respect to shear characteristics, a more appropriate expression is proposed to estimate the concrete shear strength for SCC girders with a compressive strength greater than 10 ksi (69 MPa). Bridge girder–deck systems containing relatively small (Texas Type A) girders containing high early-strength SCC exhibited similar flexural performance as bridge girder–deck systems with girders containing conventional concrete.

The c-type cytochromes, defined by the covalent attachment of heme to a CXXCH motif, are key electron carriers in these energy-transducing membranes. In mitochondria, cytochromes c and c1 are assembled by the cytochrome c heme lyases (CCHL and CC1HL) and by Cyc2p, a putative redox protein. A cytochrome c1 mutant with a CAPCH heme-binding site instead of the wild-type CAACH is strictly dependent upon Cyc2p for assembly. In this context, we found that overexpression of CC1HL, as well as mutations of the proline in the CAPCH site to H, L, S, or T residues, can bypass the absence of Cyc2p. The P mutation was postulated to shift the CXXCH motif to an oxidized form, which must be reduced in a Cyc2p-dependent reaction before heme ligation. However, measurement of the redox midpoint potential of apocytochrome c1 indicates that neither the P nor the T residues impact the thermodynamic propensity of the CXXCH motif to occur in a disulfide vs. dithiol form. We show instead that the identity of the second intervening residue in the CXXCH motif is key in determining the CCHL-dependent vs. CC1HL-dependent assembly of holocytochrome c1.

We compared the cytotoxicity, ROS generation, and sphingolipid synthesis of 4-oxo-4-HPR (a recently identified 4-HPR metabolite) with 4-HPR in malignant lymphoid cells. Cytotoxicity of 4-oxo-4-HPR and 4-HPR was measured in 14 malignant lymphoid cell lines using a DIMSCAN system. Median concentrations cytotoxic for 90% of cells (IC90) were 2.1 µM (range: 1.1 − 15.9) for 4-oxo-4-HPR and 4.4 µM (range: 0.7 − 29.2) for 4-HPR. In 2 of 3 cell lines tested, ROS generation (DCFDA by flow cytometry) was higher with 4-HPR vs. 4-oxo-4-HPR (table). Ascorbic acid (AA) abrogated ROS generation and significantly attenuated cytotoxicity of 4-oxo-4-HPR and 4-HPR in CCRF-CEM and COG-LL-317 cells. However, in GA-10 cells AA completely abrogated ROS generation, but not cytotoxicity, for both 4-oxo-4-HPR and 4-HPR. Intracellular sphingolipid (SL) changes, another suggested mechanism for 4-HPR cytotoxicity, were measured by tandem mass spectrometry in GA-10 cells at 48-hours, and both 4-oxo-4-HPR and 4-HPR treatment increased SL, with significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) increases by 4-oxo-4-HPR. The fold increase/control for 4-oxo-4-HPR vs. 4-HPR: ceramides = 2.1 ± 0.13 vs. 1.3 ± 0.11; dihydroceramides = 87.6 ± 7.1 vs. 34.0 ± 5.1; sphingomyelins = 4.1 ± 0.14 vs. 2.4 ± 0.04). Thus, 4-oxo-4-HPR is similar in cytotoxicity to 4-HPR, less active in generating ROS, but more active in increasing SL. The cytotoxicity of both 4-HPR and 4-oxo-4-HPR in the GA-10 cell line is independent of ROS, providing a novel in vitro model for identifying the role of SL in the cytotoxicity of these agents.Table.Cytotoxicity and ROS generation for 4-HPR and 4-oxo-4-HPR, and cell survival after ROS abrogation. Cell Line (Histopathology)CCRF-CEM (T ALL)COG-LL-317 (T ALL)GA-10 (B Burkitt lymphoma)IC90 (µM)4-oxo-4-HPR1.32.41.54-HPR1.01.57.3     ROS Generation‡ (fold increase/control)4-oxo-4-HPR2.3 ± 0.03***1.6 ± 0.02***1.7 ± 0.04**4-HPR8.3 ± 0.36***5.3 ± 0.26***2.2 ± 0.29**     ROS abrogation‡ (% inhibition from drug alone)4-oxo-4-HPR + AA55%***31%*100%*4-HPR + AA83%***91%***100%***     Cell Survival at 20 hours‡AA102.5% ± 12.6107.3% ± 14.986.8% ± 14.94-oxo-4-HPR12.9% ± 2.926.3%± 2.010.9% ± 6.84-oxo-4-HPR + AA22.9% ± 3.5***63.1% ± 8.6***9.1% ± 3.74-HPR1.2% ± 0.69.1% ± 2.011.9% ± 6.24-HPR + AA27.9% ± 6.8***91.2% ± 11.4***12.6% ± 3.1‡ Treatments: 10 µM 4-oxo-4-HPR, 10 µM 4-HPR, 200 µM AA; * P &lt; 0.05, ** P &lt; 0.01, *** P &lt; 0.001","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/70/8_Supplement/1676/562013/Abstract-1676-Cytotoxicity-of-fenretinide-and-its",""

Three distinct transportation and land use scenarios were examined with a gravity-based land use model and a standard travel demand model: a business-as-usual scenario, a road pricing policy that included a flat-rate carbon-based tax and congestion pricing of all Austin-area freeways, and an urban growth boundary policy. Two scenarios, a business-as-usual scenario and a flat-rate carbon-based tax and congestion pricing policy, were also examined with a novel, parcel-level land use change and land use intensity model and a standard travel demand model. Transportation and land use policies were predicted to have substantial effects on travel and on emissions of ozone precursors. Emissions of ozone precursors decreased markedly for all 2030 scenarios because of the implementation of more stringent federal motor vehicle emission control programs. Transportation and land use policies were predicted to lead to greater reductions of emissions of ozone precursors relative to the business-as-usual scenario. The effects of such policies on ozone concentrations and population exposure vary. Lower exposure was predicted for the road pricing scenarios, but a penalty appeared to exist in the form of relatively higher exposure predicted for the urban growth boundary on some days. This analysis indicates the potential complexity of planning for urban growth and equity and the need for integrated modeling and policy evaluation efforts.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/2158-04",""

The model results demonstrate that, in addition to the known westward flow through the Charlie Gibbs Fracture Zone (CGFZ), some Iceland Scotland overflow water (ISOW) flows westward through gaps in the Reykjanes Ridge north of the CGFZ into the Irminger Sea, and some flows southward along the eastern flank of the Mid‐Atlantic Ridge into the West European Basin. These results provide insights into the well‐known inconsistency between observed westward transport of ISOW through the CGFZ (2.4 Sv) and the transports upstream at Southeast of Iceland section (3.2 Sv) and downstream in the western Irminger Sea (4.5 Sv). Although the portion of the simulated ISOW that flows through CGFZ is about 500 m deeper than observed, the model results also show two ISOW pathways of this flow into the Irminger Sea, one northward along the western flank of the Reykjanes Ridge and the other westward before turning north‐eastward on the western side of the Irminger Basin.

His difficulties were initially interpreted as motor control problems, suggesting the need to abandon this technology, prescribe a different SGD, or adapt his existing device. An alternative conceptualization was that the existing intervention procedures had failed to shape more effective response topographies. Along these lines, a behavioral intervention, involving differential reinforcement and delayed prompting, proved effective in shaping response topographies that enabled Steven to be more successful in activating the speech output function of his iPod-based SGD. The results suggest that behavioral intervention may provide an alternative to the more costly and involved process of replacing or modifying the person’s SGD.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1534650110379633",""

Our simulations show that, on the Al(111) surface, alanes oligomerize into larger alanes. In addition, from our simulations, adsorption of atomic hydrogen on Al(111) surface leads to the formation of alanes via H-induced etching of aluminum atoms from the surface. The alanes then agglomerate at the step edges forming stringlike conformations. The identification of these stringlike intermediates as a precursor to the bulk hydride phase allows us to explain the loss of resolution in surface IR experiments with increasing hydrogen coverage on single crystal Al(111) surface. This is in excellent agreement with the experimental works of Go et al. [E. Go, K. Thuermer, and J. E. Reutt-Robey, Surf. Sci. 437, 377 (1999)]. The mobility of alanes molecules has been studied using molecular dynamics and it is found that the migration energy barrier of Al2H6 is 2.99 kcal/mol while the prefactor is D0=2.82×10−3 cm2/s. We further investigated the interaction between an alane and an aluminum vacancy using classical molecular dynamics simulations. We found that a vacancy acts as a trap for alane, and eventually fractionates/annihilates it.

In the presented entropic view, uncertainty is highest at the beginning of the process as little information is known about the solution. As additional information is acquired or generated, the solution becomes increasingly well-defined and uncertainty reduces, finally diminishing to zero at the end of the process when the design is fully defined. In previous research, three components of design complexity—size, coupling, and solvability—were identified. In this research, these metrics are used to model solution uncertainty based on the search spaces of the variables (size) and the compatibility between variable values (coupling). Solvability of the variables is assumed uniform for simplicity. Design decisions are modeled as choosing a value, or a reduced set of values, from the existing search space of a variable, thus, reducing its uncertainty. Coupling is measured as the reduction of a variable’s search space as an effect of reducing the search space of another variable. This model is then used to monitor uncertainty reduction through a design process, leading to three strategies that prescribe deciding the variables in the order of their uncertainty, number of dependents, or the influence of on other variables. Comparison between these strategies shows how size and coupling of variables in a design can be used to determine task sequencing strategy for fast design convergence.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/mechanicaldesign/article-pdf/doi/10.1115/1.4002387/5630026/101004_1.pdf",""

Both are compared with estimates based on Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) Improved Meteorological (IMET) buoy observations at 20°S, 85°W. Net surface heat fluxes are positive (warming) over most of the area under the stratus cloud deck. Upper-ocean processes responsible for balancing the surface heat flux are examined by estimating each term in the heat equation. In contrast to surface heat fluxes, geostrophic transport in the upper 50 m causes net cooling in most of the stratus cloud deck region. Ekman transport provides net warming north of the IMET site and net cooling south of the IMET site. Although the eddy heat flux divergence term can be comparable to other terms at a particular location, such as the IMET mooring site, it is negligible for the entire stratus region when area averaged because it is not spatially coherent in the open ocean. Although cold-core eddies are often generated near the coast in the eddy-resolving model, they do not significantly impact the heat budget in the open ocean in the southeast Pacific.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jpo/article-pdf/40/1/103/4730563/2009jpo4213_1.pdf",""

The abstract level identifies two types of participants (a traveler and travel information providers), two types of information (internal and external information), and two types of processes (implicit and explicit process). Subsequently, at the representation level, the two types of participants are represented as two types of agents, the Internet agent for the traveler and the Internet agent for the travel-information providers, along with information and processes associated with them through an agent-based design. Corresponding to the two types of participants, two ontologies (ontology for the traveler and ontology for the travel-information providers) are used to represent their perspectives. The two ontologies are mapped at two levels: conceptual mapping and property-value match. Conceptual mapping uses formal concept analysis to identify equivalent or overlapping concepts between the two ontologies. Subsequently, the property values of mapped concepts are evaluated in order to create a tour plan that matches a traveler's preferences with the information provided at tourism websites.

Method: Four separate and distinct models were performed by four separate biofilm research laboratories to evaluate the resistance of biofilms to antimicrobial treatments over time. These included a drip-flow biofilm model along with a hydrodebridement study, a porcine skin punch biopsy ex vivo model, a mouse chronic wound model and clinical longitudinal debridement study. Results: All four models showed that, within the first 24 hours, the biofilm community was more susceptible to the selected antibiotics, and after maturing for up to 48 hours became increasingly tolerant. In each model, there was at least a 24-hour period in which the biofilms were more resistant to antibiotics. Each of the models utilised showed a significant decrease in the resistance of the biofilm/burden to gentamicin for up to 24 hours with a confidence interval of at least 95%. The resistance increased in each of the models by 48 hours and reached original resistance levels by 72 hours. Conclusion: These data suggest the principles of biofilm-based wound care, along with the use of serial debridement to continually remove mature biofilm, followed by biofilm wound management strategies, including topical antibiotics while the bioburden is still immature and more susceptible, are valid.

Using random survey data from Chengdu (N = 300), we estimate the effects of wives’ unemployment, changing marital dynamics, and spousal responses to the wife’s unemployment on marital affection and marital tension. Under the guidance of an integrated theoretical framework, our ordered logistic and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression results show that the wives’ unemployment and subsequent economic hardship, the deteriorated mother-child relationship, the husbands’ negative responses, and the wives’ symptoms of psychological distress have deleterious effects on urban Chinese marriages. Moreover, our ancillary analyses indicate that the wives’ unemployment is indirectly associated with marital affection through the husband’s negative responses to the wife’s unemployment. This result suggests that from the husband’s perspective the wife’s economic contributions and co-breadwinner role are vitally important for urban Chinese marriages. We conclude that as anticipated the wife’s unemployment is indeed negatively associated with marital quality in reforming urban China.","https://utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/jcfs.41.5.717",""

Because CEO compensation is a key tool that boards use to align the interests of shareholders and managers, researchers have taken steps toward understanding how family representation affects CEO compensation. Prior research has painted family–member CEOs as stewards who accept lower compensation. Based on agency theory, we describe a different scenario wherein family representatives engage in strategic control that reduces family–member CEOs‘ compensation. Thus, family–member CEOs accept lower compensation only when additional family members are represented in management or on the board. In comparison with CEOs at nonfamily firms, we find that family–member CEO compensation is 13% lower when multiple family members are involved, but 56% higher when the CEO is the lone family member.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1540-6520.2010.00417.x",""

Preclinical data indicate that the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis plays a key role in CLL cell homing and retention in tissue microenvironments, such as the bone marrow. Disruption of this axis using the small-molecule CXCR4-antagonist, plerixafor, may abrogate stroma-mediated drug resistance, and enhance sensitivity of CLL cells to rituximab. To test this hypothesis, we initiated a phase 1 trial of plerixafor + rituximab in previously-treated pts with CLL. Aims:: The primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and safety of plerixafor when combined with rituximab. Methods:: Adult pts with WBC≤ 50×109/L, intermediate/high risk CLL not refractory to rituximab, and with active disease by NCI criteria were eligible in this ongoing study. Pts were treated with 3x/week rituximab, as a 100mg flat dose on Day 1, and subsequently 375mg/m2 IV for 12 total doses (i.e. for 4 weeks). Plerixafor was given SC prior to rituximab starting at the 4th rituximab dose (Day 8) for 9 total doses. Cohorts of pts were treated at 1 of 4 dose levels with plerixafor (0.08mg/kg, 0.16mg/kg, 0.24mg/kg and 0.32mg/kg). Pts were observed for dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) from the first plerixafor dose (Day 8) through Day 29 and cohort advancement followed dose escalation rules using a 3+3 design. Peripheral blood (PB) CD34+ and CLL cells were enumerated on Days 8 and 26 by flow cytometry; PB samples were obtained at baseline pre-plerixafor treatment and at 2, 4, 6, 10, and 24 hours post-plerixafor. Responses were assessed as defined by Cheson et al (Blood, 1996). Results:: 17 pts (median age 64 years; 88% male; Rai Stage IV: 53%) were enrolled, 3 pts each in the 0.08 and 0.24 mg/kg cohorts, 4 pts in the 0.16mg/kg cohort and 7 pts in the 0.32mg/kg cohort (Table 1). No DLTs were reported. Of 14 evaluable pts, 5 (36%) had partial response, 3 (21%) had stable disease for ≥2 months and 6 (43%) had progressive disease. Treatment-emergent, plerixafor-related adverse events (AEs) were seen in 5 pts and included diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, appetite loss, headache, hypoaesthesia and paraesthesia. All AEs were grade 1 except nausea (n=1) that was grade 2. Treatment-emergent serious AEs were seen in 2 pts (0.16mg/kg dose; grade 3 EBV infection, grade 2 gastrointestinal reflux disease and grade 2 dyspnea); all unrelated to plerixafor. On Day 8, there was a median 3.8-fold increase in PB CLL cells (range: 1.2 –15.0-fold), indicating CLL cell mobilization. On Day 26 fewer PB CLL cells were detected with a median fold increase of 1.5 (range, 0.9–8.0). Conclusions:: The combination of plerixafor + rituximab in CLL pts with WBC < 50×109/L was well tolerated. CLL cells were mobilized following plerixafor, and partial remissions were seen in a proportion of pts. In some cases, maximum responses were seen several months after completion of rituximab, consistent with single agent therapy. This suggests that continued follow up may show additional responses in recently treated pts. Disclosures:: Andritsos: Genzyme Corporation: Research Funding.

Expansion of the available mouse physical activity strain screens and the recently published dense single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) map of the mouse genome (≈8.3 million SNPs) and associated statistical methods allowed us to construct a more generalizable map of the quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with physical activity. Specifically, we measured wheel running activity in male and female mice (average age 9 wk) in 41 inbred strains and used activity data from 38 of these strains in a haplotype association mapping analysis to determine QTL associated with activity. As seen previously, there was a large range of activity patterns among the strains, with the highest and lowest strains differing significantly in daily distance run (27.4-fold), duration of activity (23.6-fold), and speed (2.9-fold). On a daily basis, female mice ran further (24%), longer (13%), and faster (11%). Twelve QTL were identified, with three (on Chr. 12, 18, and 19) in both male and female mice, five specific to males, and four specific to females. Eight of the 12 QTL, including the 3 general QTL found for both sexes, fell into intergenic areas. The results of this study further support the findings of a moderate to high heritability of physical activity and add general genomic areas applicable to a large number of mouse strains that can be further mined for candidate genes associated with regulation of physical activity. Additionally, results suggest that potential genetic mechanisms arising from traditional noncoding regions of the genome may be involved in regulation of physical activity.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/japplphysiol.00525.2010",""

This defect is associated with impaired insulin-induced vasodilation and mTORC1 signaling. We hypothesized that, in older subjects, pharmacological restoration of insulin-induced capillary recruitment would improve the response of muscle protein synthesis and anabolism to insulin. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twelve healthy, nondiabetic older subjects (71 ± 2 years) were randomized to two groups. Subjects were studied at baseline and during local infusion in one leg of insulin alone (Control) or insulin plus sodium nitroprusside (SNP) at variable rate to double leg blood flow. We measured leg blood flow by dye dilution; muscle microvascular perfusion with contrast enhanced ultrasound; Akt/mTORC1 signaling by Western blotting; and muscle protein synthesis, amino acid, and glucose kinetics using stable isotope methodologies. RESULTS: There were no baseline differences between groups. Blood flow, muscle perfusion, phenylalanine delivery to the leg, and intracellular availability of phenylalanine increased significantly (P &lt; 0.05) in SNP only. Akt phosphorylation increased in both groups but increased more in SNP (P &lt; 0.05). Muscle protein synthesis and net balance (nmol · min−1 · 100 ml · leg−1) increased significantly (P &lt; 0.05) in SNP (synthesis, 43 ± 6 to 129 ± 25; net balance, −16 ± 3 to 26 ± 12) but not in Control (synthesis, 41 ± 10 to 53 ± 8; net balance, −17 ± 3 to −2 ± 3). CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacological enhancement of muscle perfusion and amino acid availability during hyperinsulinemia improves the muscle protein anabolic effect of insulin in older adults.","https://journals.org/diabetes/diabetes/article-pdf/59/11/2764/394416/zdb01110002764.pdf",""

Despite widespread use of shaped holes, existing correlations for predicting performance are limited to narrow ranges of parameters. This study extends the prediction capability for shaped holes through the development of a physics-based empirical correlation for predicting laterally averaged film-cooling effectiveness on a flat-plate downstream of a row of shaped film-cooling holes. Existing data were used to determine the physical relationship between film-cooling effectiveness and several parameters, including blowing ratio, hole coverage ratio, area ratio, and hole spacing. Those relationships were then incorporated into the skeleton form of an empirical correlation, using results from the literature to determine coefficients for the correlation. Predictions from the current correlation, as well as existing shaped-hole correlations and a cylindrical hole correlation, were compared with the existing experimental data. Results show that the current physics-based correlation yields a significant improvement in predictive capability, by expanding the valid parameter range and improving agreement with experimental data. Particularly significant is the inclusion of higher blowing ratio conditions (up to M=2.5) into the current correlation, whereas the existing correlations worked adequately only at lower blowing ratios (M≈0.5).","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/turbomachinery/article-pdf/doi/10.1115/1.4002064/5848557/011002_1.pdf",""

Clinical data from a phase 1 trial with lumiliximab demonstrated an acceptable toxicity profile in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We therefore pursued a phase 1/2 dose-escalation study of lumiliximab added to fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) in previously treated CLL patients. Thirty-one patients received either 375 mg/m2 (n = 3) or 500 mg/m2 (n = 28) of lumiliximab in combination with FCR for 6 cycles. The toxicity profile was similar to that previously reported for FCR in treatment of relapsed CLL. The overall response rate was 65%, with 52% of patients achieving a complete response (CR), which compares favorably with the CR rate previously reported for the FCR regimen alone in relapsed CLL. The estimated median progression-free survival for all responders was 28.7 months. The addition of lumiliximab to FCR therapy is feasible, achieves a high CR rate, and does not appear to enhance toxicity in previously treated patients with CLL. A randomized trial comparing lumiliximab plus FCR with FCR alone is underway to define the benefit of this combination in relapsed CLL.

Protein kinases each have a conserved ATP‐binding site, as well as one or more substrate‐binding site(s) that exhibit recognition features for a protein substrate. Thus, by bringing ATP and a substrate into close proximity, each protein kinase can modify its substrate by transferring the γ phosphate of the ATP molecule to a serine, threonine, or tyrosine residue on the substrate. In such a way, signaling pathways downstream from the substrate can be regulated, dependent on the phosphorylated versus dephosphorylated forms of the substrate. This unit describes an assay employing a fluorescent peptide substrate to measure the incorporation of non‐radiolabeled phosphate. The assay is based on the principle that the phosphorylation of the peptide substrate leads to an increase in the fluorescence emission intensity of an appended fluorophore.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2F0471142727.mb1817s91",""

Investigating these genes is of primary importance in understanding sexual dimorphism and genome evolution. In a particular instance in Drosophila, X-linked nuclear transport genes (Ntf-2 and ran) have given rise to autosomal retroposed copies three independent times (along the lineages leading to Drosophila melanogaster, D. ananassae, and D. grimshawi). Here we explore in further detail the expression and the mode of evolution of these Drosophila Ntf-2- and ran-derived retrogenes. Five of the six retrogenes show male-biased expression. The ran-like gene of D. melanogaster and D. simulans has undergone recurrent positive selection. Similarly, in D. ananassae and D. atripex, the Ntf-2 and ran retrogenes show evidence of past positive selection. The data suggest that strong selection is acting on the origin and evolution of these retrogenes. Avoiding male meiotic X inactivation, increasing level of expression of X-linked genes in male testes, and/or sexual antagonism might explain the recurrent duplication of retrogenes from X to autosomes. Interestingly, the ran-like in D. yakuba has mostly pseudogenized alleles. Disablement of the ran-like gene in D. yakuba indicates turnover of these duplicates. We discuss the possibility that Dntf-2r and ran-like might be involved in genomic conflicts during spermatogenesis.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/184/4/1067/46842355/genetics1067.pdf",""

In the laboratory during the winter hibernation period, many hibernators enter a series of multi-day torpor bouts, dropping their body temperature to near ambient, and cease to feed even if food is present in their cage. The mechanism(s) that regulates food intake in hibernators is unclear. Recently, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been shown to play a key role in the central regulation of food intake in mammals. We hypothesized that infusing an AMPK activator, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1 B-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR), intracerebroventricularly (ICV) into the third ventricle of the hypothalamus would stimulate yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris) to feed during their hibernation season. Infusion of AICAR ICV into marmots at an ambient temperature of 22°C caused a significant (P&lt;0.05) increase in food intake. In addition, animals stimulated to feed did not enter torpor during the infusion period. Marmots ICV infused with saline did not increase food intake and these animals continued to undergo torpor at an ambient temperature of 22°C. Our results suggest that AICAR stimulated the food intake pathway, presumably by activating AMPK. These results support the hypothesis that AMPK may be involved in regulating food intake in hibernators and that there may be common neural pathways involved in regulating feeding and eliciting torpor.","http://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article-pdf/213/12/2031/1424639/2031.pdf",""

This interaction involves the C-terminal sequence of APX3 (i.e., a transmembrane domain plus a few basic amino acid residues). The specificity of the AKR2A–APX3 interaction suggests that AKR2A may function as a molecular chaperone for APX3 because binding of AKR2A to the transmembrane domain can prevent APX3 from forming aggregates after translation. Analysis of three akr2a mutants indicates that these mutant plants have reduced steady state levels of APX3. Reduced expression of AKR2A using RNA interference also leads to reduced steady state levels of APX3 and reduced targeting of APX3 to peroxisomes in plant cells. Since AKR2A also binds specifically to the chloroplast OUTER ENVELOPE PROTEIN7 (OEP7) and is required for the biogenesis of OEP7, AKR2A may serve as a molecular chaperone for OEP7 as well. The pleiotropic phenotype of akr2a mutants indicates that AKR2A plays many important roles in plant cellular metabolism and is essential for plant growth and development.","http://academic.oup.com/plcell/article-pdf/22/3/811/37012527/plcell_v22_3_811.pdf",""

We conducted a phase I study to determine the maximum-tolerated dose and pharmacokinetics of vorinostat in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Patients and Methods: Patients had solid malignancies and acceptable bone marrow and renal function. Hepatic dysfunction was categorized as mild, moderate, or severe by the National Cancer Institute Organ Dysfunction Working Group criteria. Fifteen patients with normal liver function were enrolled as controls. All patients received a single 400-mg dose of vorinostat for pharmacokinetic studies. One week later, daily vorinostat dosing was begun and continued until toxicity or disease progression occurred. The daily vorinostat dose was escalated within each hepatic dysfunction category. Vorinostat plasma concentrations were quantitated by a validated liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry assay and modeled noncompartmentally. Results: Fifty-seven patients were enrolled (median age, 59 years; females, n = 24); 42 patients had hepatic dysfunction (16 mild, 15 moderate, and 11 severe). Eight of nine patients with dose-limiting toxicity had grade 4 thrombocytopenia. The recommended vorinostat doses in mild, moderate, and severe hepatic dysfunction were 300, 200, and 100 mg, respectively, on the daily continuous schedule. There were no significant differences in vorinostat pharmacokinetic parameters among the normal or hepatic dysfunction categories. Disease stabilization was noted in 12 patients. Of five patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma, one patient had a partial response, and four patients had stable disease. A patient with papillary thyroid carcinoma had stable disease for more than 2 years. Conclusion: Patients with varying degrees of hepatic dysfunction require appropriate dose reduction even though vorinostat pharmacokinetics are unaltered.","https://ascopubs.org/doi/pdfdirect/10.1200/JCO.2010.30.2307",""

Broad PL emission is seen at room temperature with peak position at 3.25 eV. This coincides with the overtone of the longitudinal optic (LO) band. Up to six LO phonon orders are observed. Temperature dependence of the LO phonon energy is described by a two-phonon decay mechanism with energies 100 and 496 cm−1. The temperature dependence of the PL shift is interpreted based on electron-phonon interactions. A two-phonon description is sufficient to describe the temperature shift in the band gap through occupation at average acoustic and optic phonon energies 125 and 500 cm−1, respectively.

In this report, we used an ex vivo model of primary cardiomyocyte culture to investigate the mechanisms of burn-induced mitochondrial impairment. Briefly, blood serum was collected from Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats subjected to 40% total body surface area burn and added (10% vol/vol) to primary cardiomyocytes prepared from SD rats. The effect of the burn serum on mitochondrial function and membrane integrity in the myocytes was analyzed. Exposure of myocytes to burn serum doubled the mitochondrial membrane damage measured by two independent assays. This treatment also significantly elevated mitochondrial oxidative stress, indicated by a more than 30% increase in lipid oxidation. Downregulation of mitochondrial antioxidant defense was also evident since the activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase were reduced by about 30% and 50%, respectively. Burn serum also induced deficiency of mitochondrial metabolism, indicated by a 30% decrease in the activity of cytochrome c oxidase. These mitochondrial dysfunctions appear to be generated by oxidative stress because burn serum induced a significant increase of mitochondrial oxygen species (mtROS) in cardiomyocytes, and pretreatment of cardiomyocytes with the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine prevented the mitochondrial damages induced by burn serum. Remarkably, the increase in mtROS was abolished by an antibody-mediated blockade of CD14. Furthermore, burn injury-induced mitochondrial damage in cardiomyocytes was prevented in CD14 knockout mice. Taken together, these data suggested that burn injury produces CD14-dependent mitochondrial damage via oxidative stress in myocardium.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpheart.00927.2009",""

The results are discussed in terms of the influence of L1 orthographic depth on spelling, and how learning disability specialists can utilize the information while evaluating the spelling/literacy skills of English L2 learners.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/073194871003300309",""

In the face of this risk, operators must balance the need to conserve capital and protect the environment by avoiding over drilling with the desire to maximize profitability by achieving the optimal well spacing as quickly as possible. Previous unconventional gas developments such as the Carthage Field (Cotton Valley) have implemented multiple infill drilling programs over several decades to optimize well spacing, with significant reduction in value (McKinney et al. 2002). However, in emerging plays such as the non-core Barnett Shale and the Fayetteville Shale, historical infill programs are not available to evaluate optimal spacing and we do not have the luxury of developing these fields over the next 30-40 years. Existing approaches for optimizing development, such as integrated reservoir simulation studies or statistical moving-window methods, can be either prohibitively time-consuming and expensive or they do not consider the uncertainty inherent in the assessment.","http://onepetro.org/SPEURCC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/137816-MS/1753542/spe-137816-ms.pdf",""

Thus, while transcriptional output undergoes a dramatic increase between uninduced and induced conditions, occupancy of a large portion of the transcription machinery does not. As such, activation of these poised promoters depends on rate-limiting steps after recruitment of TBP and RNAPII for regulated expression. Little is known about the transcription components required in these latter steps of transcription in vivo. To identify components with critical roles in transcription after recruitment of TBP in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we screened for loss of gene expression activity from promoter-tethered TBP in &gt;100 mutant strains deleted for a transcription-related gene. The assay revealed a dramatic enrichment for strains containing deletions in genes encoding subunits of the Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex and Mediator. Analysis of an authentic postrecruitment-regulated gene (CYC1) reveals that SAGA occupies the promoter under both uninduced and induced conditions. In contrast, Mediator is recruited only after transfer to inducing conditions and correlates with activation of the preloaded polymerase at CYC1. These studies indicate the critical functions of SAGA and Mediator in the mechanism of activation of genes with rate-limiting steps after recruitment of TBP.","https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-pdf/184/3/659/49430534/genetics0659.pdf",""

An ambulatory control group (CC) and four groups of HU rats were used: HU, HU + anesthesia (ANHU), HU + eccentric muscle contractions (HU + ECC), and HU + isometric and eccentric muscle contractions (HU + ISO/ECC). Animals in the two SRT groups were trained once every other day at 100% daily peak isometric torque (P0). HU resulted in significantly lower plantarflexor muscle mass (−33% versus CC) and reduced isometric strength (−10%), which reductions were partially attenuated in both training groups. Significantly reduced total and cancellous volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) and total bone mineral content (BMC) at the proximal tibia metaphysis (PTM) also was evidenced in HU and ANHU groups compared with both SRT groups (p &lt; .05).

Owing to declining conventional gas production, the U.S. has led the world in development of unconventional gas resources (UGR) and technology over the past 3 decades. To facilitate transfer of unconventional gas technology and development internationally, we developed a software, FAST (Formation Analog Selection Tool), as a tool to objectively and rapidly identify and rank analog formations. FAST software uses an existing database (BASIN) that contains geoscience and engineering parameters for approximately 240 formations in 25 North American basins that are mature for conventional and unconventional oil and gas production. We designed a FAST report module that provides both general and detailed interpretation graphs and tables. FAST reports give an overview of analog results, and they allow insights into the quantitative details of reservoir parameter comparisons. Although the software needs further validation, preliminary testing shows consistent results. Planned and ongoing improvements to FAST include quality checking of formation parameters in the database, assessment of parameter weighting factors, validation of the analog selection performance against the literature and independent studies regarding analog formations, and linkage of FAST with a Drilling & Completion Advisory System to identify the best engineering practices to be applied in early stages of testing analogous target formations.","http://onepetro.org/SPEAPOG/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/132880-MS/1720466/spe-132880-ms.pdf",""

As such, Btk represents an ideal therapeutic target for B-cell malignancies dependent upon BCR signaling. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic leukemia (SLL) has been reported to have constitutively active BCR signaling. PCI-32765 is a potent, selective, irreversible and orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of Btk that has pre-clinical activity in B-cell malignancies (Proc Natl Acad Sci 2010;107(29):13075-80). PCI-32765 was therefore moved forward to a Phase 1 study in B-cell malignancies including patients (pts) with CLL/SLL. A subsequent CLL/SLL-specific Phase 1b study was initiated to further explore safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and efficacy of PCI-32765. This report includes a composite summary of the CLL/SLL experience in both of these studies. Pts and Methods:: Pts with CLL/SLL who had relapsed or refractory disease after >1 prior treatment regimens were eligible for treatment in each of the studies whereas the second Phase 1b study also included a cohort of elderly pts (aged ≥ 65 years) with CLL/SLL who required treatment and were “treatment-naive”. Responses were assessed by the investigator using the International Working Group CLL criteria (Hallek et al, Blood 2008 for pts with CLL) and the International Workshop to Standardize Response Criteria for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas (Cheson et al, J Clin Oncol 2007 for pts with SLL). Results:: To date, 30 CLL/SLL patients (including 4 treatment-naive) have been enrolled across the 2 studies. Eighty-four percent of subjects are men with an overall median age of 68 (range 44–82) years. Of the subjects with prior therapy for CLL/SLL the median number of prior therapies is 3 (range 1–4). Treatment has been well-tolerated; Grade ≥ 3 toxicities have been infrequent (10/30 pts; 33%). Two study-drug related serious adverse events have been reported: 1 case of viral adenitis (Grade 3) and 1 case of viral infection (Grade 2). Two adverse events have led to discontinuation of study drug: a small bowel obstruction (Grade 3) and exacerbation of chronic obstructive disease (Grade 3); both events were reported as unrelated to study drug. No study-drug related deaths have reported. There has been no change in either NK cell or T cell counts. Target inhibition as measured by a probe of Btk drug occupancy showed inhibition of Btk at PCI-32765 exposure levels of ≥ 245 ng•h/mL. Of the 14 patients currently evaluable for response using the pre-defined criteria, the overall response rate is 64% (1 complete remission [CR], 8 partial remissions [PR], and 4 SD). Both studies are ongoing and open to enrollment. An update on response rate, response duration, safety, and PD information will be presented on enrolled patients based on a November 2010 database cut-off. Conclusion:: PCI-32765 is a novel oral and selective “first-in-human” inhibitor of Btk that induces objective partial and complete responses in a substantial proportion of pts with CLL/SLL and has a favorable safety profile. These data support further studies of both monotherapy and also combination treatment with PCI-32765 in CLL/SLL. Disclosures:: O'Brien: Pharmacyclics, Inc: Honoraria, PI grant.

In this paper, the latitudinal dependence of this wave propagation and its associated vertical mixing are investigated primarily using a nonlinear numerical ocean model. Three-dimensional idealized simulations show that the coastal oceanic response to sea breeze is trapped poleward of 30° latitude; however, it can propagate offshore as Poincare waves equatorward of 30° latitude. Near 30° latitude, the maximum oceanic response to sea breeze moves offshore slowly because of the near-zero group speed of Poincare waves at this latitude. The lateral energy flux convergence plus the energy input from the wind is maximum near the critical latitude, leading to increased local dissipation by vertical mixing. This local dissipation is greatly reduced at other latitudes. The implications of these results for the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) at ∼30°N is considered. Simulations with realistic bathymetry of the GOM confirm that a basinwide ocean response to coastal sea-breeze forcing is established in form of Poincare waves. Enhanced vertical mixing by the sea breeze is shown on the model northern shelf, consistent with observations on the Texas–Louisiana shelf. Comparison of the three-dimensional and one-dimensional models shows some significant limitations of one-dimensional simplified models for sea-breeze simulations near the critical latitude.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jpo/article-pdf/40/1/48/4730767/2009jpo4216_1.pdf",""

Society's growing demands for energy results in rapid increase in oil consumption and motivates conversion of unconventional resources to conventional resources. There are enormous amounts of heavy oil reserves in the world but the lack of cost effective technologies either for extraction, transportation, or refinery upgrading hinders the development of heavy oil reserves. The traditional problem of conventional heavy oil upgrading is that it takes large amounts of thermal energy and expensive chemicals or catalysts to upgrade. Using E-Beam technology we may lower the energy requirement and reduce the use of specific chemicals or catalysts. The design of facilities can be simpler and will contribute to lowering the costs of transportation and processing of heavy oil and bitumen.","http://onepetro.org/SPEATCE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/133919-MS/1724085/spe-133919-ms.pdf",""

We previously found that myoblasts can be converted to a physiologically active neuronal phenotype by transferring a single recombinant transcription factor, REST-VP16, which directly activates target genes of the transcriptional repressor, REST. However, the neuronal subtype of M-RV cells and whether they can establish synaptic communication in the brain have remained unknown. M-RV cells engineered to express green fluorescent protein (M-RV-GFP) had functional ion channels but did not establish synaptic communication in vitro. However, when transplanted into newborn mice cerebella, a site of extensive postnatal neurogenesis, these cells expressed endogenous cerebellar granule precursors and neuron proteins, such as transient axonal glycoprotein-1, neurofilament, type-III β-tubulin, superior cervical ganglia-clone 10, glutamate receptor-2, and glutamate decarboxylase. Importantly, they exhibited action potentials and were capable of receiving glutamatergic synaptic input, similar to the native cerebellar granule neurons. These results suggest that M-RV-GFP cells differentiate into glutamatergic neurons, an important neuronal subtype, in the postnatal cerebellar milieu. Our findings suggest that although activation of REST-target genes can reprogram myoblasts to assume a general neuronal phenotype, the subtype specificity may then be directed by the brain microenvironment.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/stem.509",""

Interfacial tension acts as a restoring force, leading to interfacial fluctuation and a pressure (sound) wave. Here we focus on the interface motion. We apply the theory of ferrofluids to the case of an interface in a cylindrical pore. The predictions are consistent with experiments with an aqueous suspension of iron oxide nanorods in which the interface motion is measured by optical coherence tomography. The relative densities of the fluid phases (air/aqueous and dodecane/aqueous in our case) strongly affect the displacement of the interface. Application of a magnetic field introduces pressure-like terms into the equation of fluid phase motion. We then recast the problem in terms of interface motion, extending a numerical interface-tracking model based on the level-set method to account for capillarity and magnetic pressures simultaneously. We use the model to illustrate the motion of an interface between inviscid fluids at the pore scale when magnetic forces are imposed on one fluid phase.","http://onepetro.org/SPEIOR/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/129850-MS/2485067/spe-129850-ms.pdf",""

In this study, we investigate the changes in the wettability of carbonate rocks when invaded by spent acid experimentally. These changes in the wettability are due to the various additives that are added to the acid treatment.","http://onepetro.org/SPETTCE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/133166-MS/1721607/spe-133166-ms.pdf",""

This trend is expanding quickly worldwide. Unlike in many mature North American basins, where resources and reserves are well characterized, the volume of unconventional gas resources is generally unknown in most basins outside North America (frontier basins). Therefore, a comprehensive investigation and evaluation of North American unconventional gas resources is significant not only for identifying and understanding the quantitative distributions of recoverable UGR in North American basins, but also for estimating the volume of UGR in frontier basins. Our investigation of North American unconventional gas resources is based on the resource triangle concept, which implies that all natural resources, including oil and gas, are distributed lognormally in nature. Martin et al. (2010) described a methodology to estimate values of total recoverable resources (TRR) for unconventional gas reservoirs. In their work, the authors combined estimates of production, reserves, reserves growth, and undiscovered resources from a variety of sources into a logical distribution. They used data from 8 basins in North America to demonstrate their results. We have expanded the work of Martin et al. (2010) to include data from a total of 25 basins in North America. The results show that the overall ratio of TRR in unconventional gas reservoirs to those in conventional oil and gas reservoirs in the 25 basins is approximately 4 to 1. This means that for every Tcfe of oil and gas produced from conventional reservoirs, one could expect another 4 Tcfe to be technically recoverable from unconventional gas reservoirs in the same basin. This observation can help companies assess the potential of unconventional gas resources development in North American basins and in frontier basins worldwide.","http://onepetro.org/SPEURCC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/137599-MS/1753336/spe-137599-ms.pdf",""

To assess the potential influence of neuro-antigen specific memory B cells from RRMS patients on autologous CD4+ T cell activation, we compared CD80 and HLA-DR expression, IL-10 and LTα secretion, neuro-antigen binding capacity, and functional neuro-antigen presentation by memory B cells from RRMS patients and compared these parameters to naïve B cells from RRMS patients and to memory and naïve B cells from healthy donors (HDs). We identified memory B cells from a subset of RRMS patients that were functionally capable of presenting neuro-antigen to autologous T cells. Notwithstanding the fact that the phenotypic parameters that promote efficient antigen presentation were observed to be similar between RRMS and HDs memory B cells, a corresponding capability to present neuro-antigen was not observed in HD memory B cells.

Information on the outcome of human ingestions of these drugs is not readily available. Objective:: To describe human ingestions of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors reported to poison centers. Methods:: All human ingestions of deracoxib and firocoxib reported to Texas poison centers during 2003–2009 were identified, and the distribution of ingestions by demographic and clinical factors was determined. Final medical outcome was determined by poison center staff, based on adverse clinical effects that are observed or expected. Results:: Of 72 total ingestions, 56.9% involved deracoxib and 43.1% involved firocoxib. One tablet or less was ingested in 87.7% of cases in which the number of tablets was known. The patients were 62.5% female, 51.4% aged 0–5 years, 6.9% aged 6–19 years, and 41.7% aged 20 years or more. The patient was managed on site in 94.4% of the cases. The distribution of cases by final medical outcome was 44.4% no effect, 18.1% not followed but judged nontoxic, 34.7% not followed but minimal effects possible, and 2.8% effects probably not related to the ingestion. Conclusions:: Human ingestions of deracoxib and firocoxib reported to Texas poison centers were relatively uncommon. Such ingestions usually involved 1 tablet or less. Cases followed to known outcome did not result in serious outcomes and were frequently managed on site.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/875512251002600302",""

As the pressure falls below the bubble point the presence of two immiscible phases reduces the oil relative permeability and leads to lower oil production rates. In this paper, we show that the application of fluorinated chemicals can mitigate this impairment associated with gas blocking of volatile oils. We show through laboratory experiments that the treatment not only removes the water from the treated zone, but also modifies the wettability of the rock surface to neutral wet, minimizes capillary trapping and enhances the mobility of oil and gas. The chemical treatment is effective in the presence of connate or flowing water over a range of temperatures. This technique may be used as a curative or preventive treatment in volatile oil reservoirs, potentially increasing oil production rates and recoverable reserves. High-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) coreflood tests were conducted that show that the treatment improved the relative permeability, by a factor of about 1.3 to 2.6 at a GOR of 6000 to 7000 scf/STB in sandstone and limestone cores at low capillary numbers (Nc). Wettability alteration was measured using contact angle and imbibition tests. These tests together with x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis were used to screen the selected surfactants. Since this durable enhancement is achieved by treating a small area around the wellbore, it may be applicable in a wide variety of wells.","http://onepetro.org/SPEURCC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/138124-MS/1755106/spe-138124-ms.pdf",""

GRACE data show a significant decrease in TWS in the lower (southern) La Plata river basin of South America over the period 2002–2009, consistent with recognized drought conditions in the region. GRACE data reveal a detailed picture of temporal and spatial evolution of this severe drought event, which suggests that the drought began in lower La Plata in around austral spring 2008 and then spread to the entire La Plata basin and peaked in austral fall 2009. During the peak, GRACE data show an average TWS deficit of ∼12 cm (equivalent water layer thickness) below the 7 year mean, in a broad region in lower La Plata. GRACE measurements are consistent with accumulated precipitation data from satellite remote sensing and with vegetation index changes derived from Terra satellite observations. The Global Land Data Assimilation System model captures the drought event but underestimates its intensity. Limited available groundwater‐level data in southern La Plata show significant groundwater depletion, which is likely associated with the drought in this region. GRACE‐observed TWS change and precipitation anomalies in the studied region appear to closely correlate with the ENSO climate index, with dry and wet seasons corresponding to La Niña and El Niño events, respectively.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1029%2F2010JD014689",""

The approximation considers 2D spatial properties of Monte Carlo-derived flux-sensitivity functions (FSFs) to simulate neutron and density measurements. Based on new research, we implemented the linear iterative refinement method with explicit 3D spatial properties of FSFs to approximate nuclear borehole measurements acquired in high-angle and horizontal (HA/HZ) wells. We used generic neutron and density tools that are close to commercial tool designs to construct 3D FSFs in the proximity of a bed boundary between layers of contrasting petrophysical properties. Likewise, to benchmark the approximation, we consider adjacent layers of 5% and 30% porosity water-saturated sandstone. For the case of neutron measurements, variations of azimuthal geometric factors are as large as 20° and 57° for the near and far detectors, respectively. Variations in the radial length of investigation (J-factors) are as large as [Formula: see text] for near and far detectors. In the case of density measurements, radial and azimuthal geometric factors are approximately invariant. Linear iterative refinement approximations yield errors in the simulated neutron porosity ranging from 1.6% to 4.3% with respect to Monte Carlo-simulated logs in wells deviating from 60° to 85° from the vertical.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/1.3335953",""

In this study, hyperspectral imaging data were acquired from individual maize leaves and the main objective was to evaluate a classification system for detection of drought stress levels and spider mite infestation levels across maize hybrids and vertical position of maize leaves. A second objective was to estimate biomass and biofuel potential (heating value) of growing maize plants. Stepwise discriminant analysis was used to identify the five spectral bands (440, 462, 652, 706, and 784 nm) that contributed most to the classification of three levels of drought stress (moderate, subtle, and none) across hybrids, leaf position, and spider mite infestation. Regarding the five selected spectral bands, average reflectance values and standard variogram parameters (“nugget”, “sill”, and “range” derived from variogram analysis) were examined as indicators of spider mite and/or drought stress. There was consistent significant effect of drought stress on average reflectance values, while only one spectral band responded significantly to spider mite infestations. Different variogram parameters provided reliable indications of spider mite infestation and drought stress. Based on independent validation, variogram parameters could be used to accurately predict spider mite density but were less effective as indicators of drought stress. In addition, variogram parameters were used as explanatory variables to predict biomass and biofuel potential of individual maize plants. The potential of using variogram analysis as part of hyperspectral imaging analysis is discussed.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1366/000370210791414272",""

For instance, stress in the MV elevated due to ETER may cause leaflets tearing near suture. Little has been known about shear stress on the MV and LV walls under MV ETER conditions, where high shear stress might cause platelet activation or hemolysis [3]. When ETER is done at the central leaflet edges, it generates two MV orifices, leads to two deflected jets, and completely changes vortices in the LV. ETER also reduces the orifice area, and increases jet velocity and transmitral pressure [1,2,4]. Flow patterns in the LV and ETER effects on the LV and MV functions have not been understood well.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/SBC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/SBC2010-19570/4200762/287_1.pdf",""

Employing the Citrobacter rodentium -induced transmissible murine colonic hyperplasia (TMCH) model, we previously showed that a high-calcium diet (hCa) significantly abrogated hyperplasia in the distal colons of NIH-Swiss mice. Here, we explored the mechanism of dietary protection by hCa by analyzing the expression of genes involved in the regulation of Ca uptake/flux in the intestinal epithelium, including the Ca-sensing receptor, vitamin D receptor, Ca binding protein, and transient receptor potential cation channels, subfamily V, members 5 and 6 (TRPV5/6). Interestingly, while TRPV6 expression increased significantly during TMCH, the expression of the other gene products was unchanged. This elevated TRPV6 expression was significantly abrogated by a hCa diet. Immunofluorescence revealed apical membrane localization of TRPV6 in the normal colon, whereas during TMCH we observed intense apical pole and cytoplasmic staining along the entire longitudinal crypt axis, including the expanded proliferating zone. The hCa diet reversed this effect. In humans, overexpression of TRPV6 was associated with early-stage colon cancer, and in colon carcinoma cells, inhibition of TRPV6 expression by small interfering RNA inhibited their proliferation and induced apoptosis. TRPV6 small interfering RNA also diminished the transcriptional activity of the calcium-dependent nuclear factors in activated T cells. Thus the aberrant overexpression of TRPV6 contributes to colonic crypt hyperplasia in mice and to colon cancer cell proliferation in humans. Therefore, it is likely that suppression of TRPV6 by a hCa diet is required for its protective effects in the colon.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpgi.00193.2010",""

Gene reactivation after DAC is variable and incompletely understood. Here, we established a cell line system (YB5) derived from the SW48 colon cancer cell line to study DAC-induced reactivation. YB5 contains a hypermethylated cytomegalovirus promoter driving green fluorescent protein (GFP), and the locus is transcriptionally silent. GFP reexpression can be achieved by DAC treatment, but the expression level of individual cells is heterogeneous. DAC-treated YB5 cells were separated into GFP-positive and GFP-negative subpopulations. By comparing DAC-treated sorted GFP-positive and GFP-negative cells, we found that their methylation levels were similarly decreased but that histone modifications and histone H3 densities were remarkably different. Despite a similar degree of (incomplete) DNA hypomethylation, GFP-positive cells reverted to an active chromatin structure marked by higher H3K9 acetylation, lower H3K27 trimethylation, and lower promoter nucleosome density. GFP-negative cells had histone modifications and promoter nucleosome density, similar to parental cells. On DAC withdrawal, gradual resilencing and remethylation occurred in both GFP-positive and GFP-negative cells, and the resilencing correlated with a gradual increase in nucleosome occupancy in GFP-positive cells. These data show that hypomethylation alone after DAC is insufficient for gene expression induction, and that chromatin resetting to an active state including nucleosome eviction is required for activation of protein expression. Our findings suggest that gene expression is the key in optimizing DAC treatment strategies in the clinic.

The temperature measurements are obtained from permanent monitoring systems such as downhole temperature gauges and fiber optic sensors.

This comparison leads to their integration, which enables a more precise understanding of managers’ roles within RBT.

This leads to in-depth reviews of three areas where research on resource orchestration can be used to extend RBT. These areas are (1) breadth (resource orchestration across the scope of the firm), (2) life cycle (resource orchestration at various stages of firm maturity), and (3) depth (resource orchestration across levels of the firm).

Although recent advances in computer technology have considerably reduced the computer time required by Monte Carlo simulations of borehole nuclear measurements, the efficiency of the method is still not sufficient for estimation of layer-by-layer properties or combined quantitative interpretation with other borehole measurements. We develop and successfully test a new linear iterative refinement method to simulate nuclear borehole measurements accurately and rapidly. The approximation stems from Monte Carlo-derived geometric response factors, referred to as flux sensitivity functions (FSFs), for specific density and neutron-tool configurations. Our procedure first invokes the integral representation of Boltzmann’s transport equation to describe the detector response from the flux of particles emitted by the radioactive source. Subsequently, we use theMonte Carlo N-particle (MCNP) code to calculate the associated detector response function and the particle flux included in the integral form of Boltzmann’s equation. The linear iterative refinement method accounts for variations of the response functions attributable to local perturbations when numerically simulating neutron and density porosity logs. We quantify variations in the FSFs of neutron and density measurements from borehole environmental effects and spatial variations of formation properties. Simulations performed with the new approximations yield errors in the simulated value of density of less than [Formula: see text] with respect to Monte Carlo-simulated logs. Moreover, for the case of radial geometric factor of density, we observe a maximum shift of [Formula: see text] at 90% of the total sensitivity as a result of realistic variations of formation density. For radial variation of neutron properties (migration length), the maximum change in the radial length of investigation is [Formula: see text]. Neutron porosity values simulated with the new approximation differ by less than 10% from Monte Carlo simulations. The approximations enable the simulation of borehole nuclear measurements in seconds of CPU time compared to several hours with MCNP.","https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/1.3267877",""

A further injection of acid will follow the wormhole path where the permeability has increased significantly, leaving substantial intervals untreated. This problem can be significant as the contrast in permeability increases within the target zones. Diverting materials such as surfactant-based acids play an important role in mitigating this problem. Several papers published in the literature aimed to verify the diversion capability and the performance of the self-diverting acids.

This overuse is characterized by the practice of cross-shipping, where a DI both deposits and withdraws cash of the same denomination in the same business week in the same geographical area. Under the new policy, which came into effect July 2007, the Fed has imposed a recirculation fee on cross-shipped cash. The Fed intends to use this fee to induce DIs to effectively recirculate cash so that the societal cost of providing cash to the public is lowered. To examine the efficacy of this mechanism, we first characterize the social optimum and then analyze the response of DIs under a recirculation fee levied on cross-shipped cash. We show that neither a linear recirculation fee, which is the Fed's current practice, nor a more sophisticated nonlinear fee is sufficient to guarantee a socially optimal response from DIs. We then derive a fundamentally different mechanism that induces DIs to self-select the social optimum. Our mechanism incorporates a fairness adjustment that avoids penalizing DIs that recirculate their fair share of cash and rewards DIs that recirculate more than this amount. We demonstrate that the mechanism is easy to implement and tolerates a reasonable amount of imprecision in the problem parameters. We also discuss a concept of welfare-preserving redistribution wherein the Fed allows a group of DIs to reallocate (amongst themselves) their deposits and demand if such a possibility does not increase societal cost. Finally, we analyze the impact of incorporating the custodial inventory program, another component of the Fed's new policy.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1106",""

Antimicrobial resistance is increasing, creating a strain between ensuring the provision of adequate empiric therapy and slowing the development of antimicrobial resistance. Excessive antimicrobial therapy places patients are at greater risk of drug interactions, adverse events, and superinfections. Ways to maximize adequate empiric therapy include (1) categorizing each patient’s risk of being infected with a multidrug-resistant pathogen and knowledge of local susceptibility patterns, (2) de-escalating antimicrobial therapy to decrease the rates of superinfections such as Clostridium difficile, and (3) limiting the duration of therapy to decrease the likelihood of adverse events, drug interactions, and antimicrobial resistance. Pharmacodynamically enhanced dosing regimens also have the potential to improve clinical outcomes and slow the development of antimicrobial resistance. Drugs whose killing is optimized by the percentage time above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), such as β-lactams, can be given by continuous or extended infusion to provide superior pharmacodynamic (PD) target attainment rates compared with traditional regimens. Drugs whose killing is optimized with a high-peak plasma concentration to MIC ratio (eg, aminoglycosides) should be administered once daily to maximize the likelihood of achieve optimal target attainment rates. Drugs whose killing is optimized by the ratio of the area under the curve (AUC) to MIC ratio (eg, fluoroquinolones) depend on the total daily dose as opposed to the dosing schedule or infusion time.

Five experiments were performed in five groups of STZ-induced diabetic rats to study the effects of EA at ST-36 (Zusanli) on gastric slow-wave dysrhythmia, delayed GE and intestinal transit, impaired gastric accommodation, and the mechanisms of EA involving the autonomic and opioidergic pathways. We found the following: 1) EA improved gastric dysrhythmia in the diabetic rats. The normal percentage of slow waves was 55.4 ± 2.9% at baseline and significantly increased to 69.2 ± 2.2% with EA ( P = 0.01); this effect was blocked by naloxone. 2) EA resulted in a 21.4% increase in GE and 18.2% increase in small intestinal transit in the diabetic rats. 3) EA restored diabetes-induced impairment in gastric accommodation. Gastric accommodation was 0.98 ± 0.13 ml with sham EA and significantly increased to 1.21 ± 0.15 ml with EA ( P = 0.01), and this effect was blocked by naloxone. 4) EA increased vagal activity assessed by the spectral analysis of the heart rate variability.

Immunohistochemical staining of a large panel of primary non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples for ALDH1A1, ALDH3A1, and CD133 revealed a significant correlation between ALDH1A1 (but not ALDH3A1 or CD133) expression and poor prognosis in patients including those with stage I and N0 disease. Flow cytometric analysis of a panel of lung cancer cell lines and patient tumors revealed that most NSCLCs contain a subpopulation of cells with elevated ALDH activity, and that this activity is associated with ALDH1A1 expression. Isolated ALDH+ lung cancer cells were observed to be highly tumorigenic and clonogenic as well as capable of self-renewal compared with their ALDH− counterparts. Expression analysis of sorted cells revealed elevated Notch pathway transcript expression in ALDH+ cells. Suppression of the Notch pathway by treatment with either a γ-secretase inhibitor or stable expression of shRNA against NOTCH3 resulted in a significant decrease in ALDH+ lung cancer cells, commensurate with a reduction in tumor cell proliferation and clonogenicity. Taken together, these findings indicate that ALDH selects for a subpopulation of self-renewing NSCLC stem-like cells with increased tumorigenic potential, that NSCLCs harboring tumor cells with ALDH1A1 expression have inferior prognosis, and that ALDH1A1 and CD133 identify different tumor subpopulations. Therapeutic targeting of the Notch pathway reduces this ALDH+ component, implicating Notch signaling in lung cancer stem cell maintenance.

This comparison leads to their integration, which enables a more precise understanding of managers’ roles within RBT. Then the authors discuss what is known and what remains to be known about resource orchestration. This leads to in-depth reviews of three areas where research on resource orchestration can be used to extend RBT. These areas are (1) breadth (resource orchestration across the scope of the firm), (2) life cycle (resource orchestration at various stages of firm maturity), and (3) depth (resource orchestration across levels of the firm).

Using a 2½-layer reduced-gravity ocean model, a systematic investigation into oceanic processes controlling the tropical Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) response to AMOC changes by varying the strength of northward mass transport at the open boundaries was conducted. It is found that the North Brazil Current (NBC) reverses its direction in response to a shutdown of the AMOC. Such a circulation change causes a decrease in upper equatorial ocean stratification and warming in the Gulf of Guinea and off the coast of Africa. These findings point to the importance of oceanic dynamics in the equatorial SST response to AMOC changes. Sensitivity experiments further show that the SST response relates nonlinearly to AMOC changes. The strength of the SST response increases dramatically when the AMOC strength falls below a threshold value. This nonlinear threshold behavior depends on the position of a subsurface temperature gradient forming along the boundary between the northern subtropical gyre and the tropical gyre that interacts with the western boundary current. The analysis suggests that, in order for the oceanic dynamics to have a dominant influence on tropical Atlantic SST in response to AMOC changes, two conditions must be satisfied: 1) the AMOC must weaken substantially so that the NBC flows equatorward, permitting water mass exchange between the northern subtropical and tropical gyres, and 2) the subsurface temperature front must be located in an optimal location where subsurface temperature anomalies induced by AMOC change are able to enter the equatorial zone.","http://journals.ametsoc.org/jcli/article-pdf/23/2/312/3956175/2009jcli3042_1.pdf",""

The protective effect of an early pregnancy is, in part, linked to changes in circulating hormones that are involved in both normal breast development and breast cancer. For example, a reduction in circulating growth hormone (GH) has been shown to protect rats from carcinogen-induced mammary tumors. We examined the ability of a full-term pregnancy to alter the endocrine GH/insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) axis and how this change affected normal mammary gland function in two commonly used rat models (Sprague-Dawley and Wistar Furth). Circulating GH and IGF-I were measured in blood drawn every 30 minutes from parous and age-matched virgin female rats. Mean serum GH levels were significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.01) in parous compared with age-matched virgin rats for both strains. Changes in GH levels were independent of estrous cycle, indicated by a significant (P &lt; 0.05) reduction in circulating levels of GH during estrus and diestrus in both parous strains. Despite the decrease in circulating GH, pituitary GH mRNA levels were unaltered in parous rats. Circulating IGF-I and hepatic IGF-I mRNA were also unaltered by parity in either rat strain. Immunoblot analysis of mammary glands showed decreases in phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A and Janus-activated kinase 2, suggesting reduced action of GH in the mammary gland. Therefore, although the parity reduction in circulating GH does not affect circulating IGF-I levels, it is possible that reduced GH acts directly at the mammary gland and may play a role in pregnancy protection from breast cancer.

Subjects and Methods: We analyzed 41 patients with stage III and IV squamous cell carcinoma of the auricle. Results: The mean age was 74.2 years (range, 20.6‐91.7 years). Thirty‐five patients (85.4%) were stage IV. Twenty‐nine patients (70.7%) had a prior history of nonauricular, nonmelanotic skin carcinoma. Twenty‐four patients (58.5%) had regional metastasis to either the cervical or parotid nodal basin. In patients with cervical metastasis, the involvement by level was 6.7% (n = 1), 80.0% (n = 12), 46.6% (n = 7), 13.3% (n = 2), and 40.0% (n = 6), respectively.

We previously found that NO donors decreased SP-B expression in H441 and MLE-12 lung epithelial cells by reducing SP-B promoter activity. In this study, we determined the roles of DNA elements and interacting transcription factors necessary for NO inhibition of SP-B promoter activity in H441 cells. We found that the NO donor diethylenetriamine-nitric oxide adduct (DETA-NO) decreased SP-B promoter thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (HNF-3), and Sp1 binding activities but increased activator protein 1 (AP-1) binding activity. DETA-NO decreased TTF-1, but not Sp1, levels, suggesting that reduced TTF-1 expression contributes to reduced TTF-1 binding activity. Lack of effect on Sp1 levels suggested that DETA-NO inhibits Sp1 binding activity per se. Overexpression of Sp1, but not TTF-1, blocked DETA-NO inhibition of SP-B promoter activity. DETA-NO inhibited SP-B promoter induction by exogenous TTF-1 without altering TTF-1 levels. DETA-NO decreased TTF-1 mRNA levels and gene transcription rate, indicating that DETA-NO inhibits TTF-1 expression at the transcriptional level. We conclude that NO inhibits SP-B promoter by decreasing TTF-1, Sp1, and HNF-3 binding activities and increasing AP-1 binding activity. NO inhibits TTF-1 levels and activity to decrease SP-B expression.

METHODS:: Participants were noncertified 2007 and 2008 incoming interns for pediatrics, combined pediatrics and internal medicine, family medicine, emergency medicine, and obstetrics and gynecology (n = 98). Pediatrics and combined pediatrics/internal medicine interns were eligible for 6-month follow-up (n = 34).

The impact on team behaviors persisted for at least 6 months. Incorporating team training into the NRP curriculum is a feasible and effective way to teach interns teamwork skills. It also improves simulated resuscitation quality by shortening the duration.","https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-pdf/125/3/539/895228/zpe00310000539.pdf",""

In vitro and animal studies have indicated that obesity-associated growth factor and cytokine signaling also play a role in breast tumorigenesis.

Genetic variations in miRNA processing genes and miRNA binding sites may affect the biogenesis of miRNA and the regulatory effect of miRNAs to their target genes, hence promoting tumorigenesis. This study analyzed 226 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in miRNA processing genes and miRNA binding sites in 339 ovarian cancer cases and 349 healthy controls to assess association with cancer risk, overall survival, and treatment response. Thirteen polymorphisms were found to have significant association with risk. The most significant were 2 linked SNPs (r2 = 0.99), rs2740351 and rs7813 in GEMIN4 [odds ratio (OR) = 0.71; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.57–0.87 and OR = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.57–0.88, respectively]. Unfavorable genotype analysis showed the cumulative effect of these 13 SNPs on risk (P for trend &lt; 0.0001). Potential higher order gene–gene interactions were identified, which categorized patients into different risk groups according to their genotypic signatures. In the clinical outcome study, 24 SNPs exhibited significant association with overall survival and 17 SNPs with treatment response. Notably, patients carrying a rare homozygous genotype of rs1425486 in PDGFC had poorer overall survival [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.69; 95% CI, 1.67–4.33] and worse treatment response (OR = 3.38; 95% CI, 1.39–8.19), compared to carriers of common homozygous and heterozygous genotypes. Unfavorable genotype analyses also showed a strong gene-dosage effect with decreased survival and increased risk of treatment nonresponse in patients with greater number of unfavorable genotypes (P for trend &lt; 0.0001). Taken together, miRNA-related genetic polymorphisms may impact ovarian cancer predisposition and clinical outcome both individually and jointly.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the alterations of liver protein profiles in estrogen‐deficient middle‐aged ovariectomized rats after GTP treatment by a gel‐based proteomic approach, which could lead to understand the mechanisms of GTP in promoting bone health. Liver samples were obtained from 14‐month‐old female ovariectomized rats treated with no GTP (OVX) or 0.5% GTP (OVX+GTP) in drinking water for 16 weeks (n=10/group). Two‐dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis combined with mass spectrometry, was used to compare the liver protein profiles of pooled samples from OVX and OVX+GTP. Liver proteins from OVX and OVX+GTP were labeled in duplicate by reversing the fluorescent dyes. Among approximately 800 reproducible protein spots detected, the level of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) was 2‐fold higher in OVX+GTP versus OVX, while the level of catechol‐O‐methyltransferase (COMT) was 1.5‐fold lower in OVX+GTP versus OVX. The changes of SOD1 and COMT in individual liver sample were confirmed by Western blot. As a result, our data provide evidences for the benefits of GTP on bone health through the antioxidant role in increasing SOD1 and the estrogen‐like effect in decreasing COMT.","",""

An attempt has been made in this work to fabricate tungsten oxide (WO3) thin films by radio-frequency reactive magnetron-sputter deposition. The impetus being the use of WO3 films for H2S sensors in coal gasification plants. The effect of growth temperature, which is varied in the range of 30–500 °C, on the growth and microstructure of WO3 thin films is investigated. Characterizations made using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) indicate that the effect of temperature is significant on the microstructure of WO3 films. XRD and SEM results indicate that the WO3 films grown at room temperature are amorphous, whereas films grown at higher temperatures are nanocrystalline. The average grain-size increases with increasing temperature. WO3 films exhibit smooth morphology at growth temperatures ≤300 °C while relatively rough at &gt;300 °C.

Twenty-five adult ewes were surgically prepared and randomly allocated to 1) an uninjured, untreated sham group ( n = 7), 2) an injured control group with no treatment ( n = 7), 3) an injury group treated with 7-nitroindazole from 1-h postinjury to the remainder of the 24-h study period ( n = 7), or 4) a sham-operated group subjected only to 7-nitroindazole to judge the effects in health. The combination injury was associated with twofold increased activity of neuronal nitric oxide synthase and oxidative/nitrosative stress, as indicated by significant increases in plasma nitrate/nitrite concentrations, 3-nitrotyrosine (an indicator of peroxynitrite formation), and malondialdehyde lung tissue content. The presence of systemic inflammation was evidenced by twofold, sixfold, and threefold increases in poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, IL-8, and myeloperoxidase lung tissue concentrations, respectively (each P < 0.05 vs. sham).

In BK5.erbB2 mice, erbB2 is overexpressed in the basal layer of epidermis and leads to heightened sensitivity to skin tumor development. GW2974 effectively inhibited skin tumor promotion by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate in wild-type and BK5.erbB2 mice, although a more marked effect was seen in BK5.erbB2 mice. In addition, this inhibitory effect was reversible when GW2974 treatment was withdrawn. GW2974 inhibited 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate–induced epidermal hyperproliferation, which correlated with reduced activation of both the EGFR and erbB2. These results support the hypothesis that both the EGFR and erbB2 play an important role in the development of skin tumors during two-stage skin carcinogenesis, especially during the tumor promotion stage. Furthermore, the marked sensitivity of BK5.erbB2 mice to the inhibitory effects of GW2974 during tumor promotion suggest greater efficacy for this compound when erbB2 is overexpressed or amplified as an early event in the carcinogenic process.

In the alcohol industry, Guerbet (dimer) alcohols are considered the ""gold"" standard for large, branched alcohols. These Guerbet alcohols tend to be more expensive than other alcohols when produced in high purity for various industrial applications. The high cost is mainly due to driving the reaction to completion and/or stripping-off of the unreacted monomer alcohol to produce high purity. However, inexpensive Guerbet alcohols (GA) can be prepared by aiming for less than quantitative conversion during the alcohol dimerization process. The resultant blend of 85-95% GA and 5-15% monomer alcohol is subsequently used in the alkoxylation process to add propylene oxide and/or ethylene oxide, followed by sulfation. Through the use of this new Guerbet process, these surfactants can be manufactured at low cost when made as sulfates as opposed to sulfonates. For example, a C32 GA can be produced from a C16 alcohol. These and other sulfate surfactants can be stabilized at high temperature with alkali. This is a surprising discovery that greatly increases the availability of low-cost, high performance surfactants for high temperature reservoirs.","http://onepetro.org/SPEIOR/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/129923-MS/1770680/spe-129923-ms.pdf",""

There are thousands of possible combinations of chemicals and components (including differing salinities, hardness, and oil concentrations) that could be tested on each crude oil. Each chemical combination requires many observations at reservoir temperature for proper evaluation. Therefore it would take too long, be too expensive, and in many cases not even be feasible to test all combinations. In practice we use our scientific understanding of surfactant/co-surfactant/co-solvent characteristics to match a chemical formulation to the properties of a crude oil and formation brine salinity at reservoir temperature. Typically the surfactant is mixed with other chemicals such as polymer in brine and injected at optimum salinity (the ASP slug). It is important that the ASP slug be a clear, stable solution since precipitation or phase separation will interfere with surfactant and polymer transport deep into the reservoir. Co-solvents and/or co-surfactants are often needed to make the primary surfactant sufficiently soluble. Core floods are presented that show the oil recovery is significantly increased by simply adding a small concentration of co-surfactant to make the ASP slug clear. In such cases, the use co-solvent/ co-surfactant is economically beneficial in terms of higher oil recovery because of the improved surfactant performance, lower surfactant retention and improved effectiveness of the polymer for mobility control.","http://onepetro.org/SPEIOR/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/130007-MS/1769850/spe-130007-ms.pdf",""

The extended record of GRACE monthly gravity solutions reveals the temporal and spatial evolution of both nonseasonal and interannual TWS change in the Amazon basin over the 7 year mission period from April 2002 to August 2009. GRACE observes a very dry season in 2002–2003 and an extremely wet season in 2009.

Our results implied that conditions far from thermodynamic equilibrium are needed to suppress phase separation. Both structural and electrical properties were found to improve significantly with increasing GR. The improvement in material quality is attributed to the suppression of phase separation with higher GR. The maximum thickness of the single phase epilayer tmax (i.e., maximum thickness that can be grown without phase separation) was determined via in situ interference pattern monitoring and found to be a function of GR.

Design: A prospective study of preoperative and postoperative culture results from the nasal, sublingual, and oropharyngeal surfaces of patients undergoing primary cleft lip repair and palate closure. Setting: Shriners Hospitals for Children, Galveston, Texas, and University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas. Patients: Seventy-nine patients were included in a 3-year period. Ten patients with isolated cleft lip underwent primary lip repair. Twenty-five patients with cleft lip and palate underwent primary lip repair, and 44 patients underwent palatoplasty. Results: Cleft palate patients had a significantly higher rate of colonization by staphylococcal species, but not methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, when compared to cleft lip patients ( p = .0298; chi-square test). Closure of the palatal cleft coincided with significant decline in the prevalence of Klebsiella and Enterobacter species ( p < .05; McNemar test). The only major complication, palatal dehiscence, was believed to be directly related to infection with group A beta-hemolytic streptococci. Conclusions: Despite a high prevalence of potential pathogenic and enteric flora preoperatively in primary palate repair, postoperative wound infection is rare in the prospective study population. However, the presence of beta-hemolytic streptococci was associated with a higher risk of repair dehiscence; therefore, screening for Streptococci prior to surgery should be performed routinely.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1597/08-187_1",""

The H9c2 cell line was used to assess whether RvE1 has direct protective effects on cardiomyocytes. In in vivo experiments, Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent 30 min of ischemia/4 h of reperfusion. Before reperfusion, rats received intravenous RvE1 (0, 0.03, 0.1, or 0.3mg/kg). In in vitro experiments, H9c2 cells were incubated with RvE1 (0, 1, 10, 100, or 1000 nM). Cells were subjected to 18 h of incubation under normoxic conditions, 16 h of hypoxia, or 16 h of hypoxia and 2 h of reoxygenation. In vivo, RvE1 dose dependently reduced infarct size (30.7 ± 1.7% of the area at risk in the control group and 29.1 ± 1.6%, 14.7 ± 1.3%, and 9.0 ± 0.6% in the 0.03, 0.1, and 0.3 mg/kg groups, respectively, P < 0.001). In vitro, RvE1 increased viability and decreased apoptosis in a dose-dependent fashion in cells exposed to hypoxia or hypoxia/reoxygenation. A maximal effect was achieved at a concentration of 100 nM. RvE1 augmented phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity, attenuated caspase-3 activity, and augmented calcium-dependent nitric oxide synthase activity in cells exposed to hypoxia or hypoxia/reoxygenation. RvE1 increased Akt, ERK1/2, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation and attenuated the levels of activated caspase-3 and phosphorylated p38 levels. AG-1478, an EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, blocked the protective effect of RvE1 both in vivo and in vitro and attenuated the RvE1-induced increase in Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In conclusion, RvE1, an anti-inflammatory mediator derived from eicosapentaenoic acid, has a direct protective effect on cardiomyocytes against ischemia-reperfusion injury and limits infarct size when administered intravenously before reperfusion.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpheart.01057.2009",""

Two electronic structures, which arise due to two different configurations of (VGa–ON)2−/1−, with ON either along the c-axis (axial configuration) or in one of the three equivalent tetrahedral positions (basal configuration), were observed.

Determining the optimal well location is a complex problem involving many factors including geological considerations, reservoir and fluid properties, economic costs, and technical ability. The most thorough approach to this problem is that of an exhaustive search, in which a simulation is run for every conceivable well position in the reservoir. Although thorough and accurate, this approach is typically not used in real world applications due to the time constraints from the excessive number of simulations. This paper suggests the use of a genetic algorithm applied to the horizontal well placement problem in a gas reservoir to reduce the required number of simulations. The objectives are to identify the optimized well placement and then to determine the benefit of optimization. Performance of the genetic algorithm was analyzed through different case scenarios. The genetic algorithm approach is used to evaluate the effect of well placement in heterogeneous and anisotropic reservoirs on reservoir recovery. The wells are constrained by surface gas rate and bottom-hole pressure for each case.","http://onepetro.org/SPEEURO/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/130999-MS/1741508/spe-130999-ms.pdf",""

Here, we report on an aptamer-based strategy directed against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the most common oncogene in glioblastoma (GBM), to detect these deadly tumor cells. GBMs are characterized by diffuse infiltration into normal brain regions, and the inability to detect GBM cells renders the disease surgically incurable with a median survival of just 14.2 months. To test the sensitivity and specificity of our platform, anti-EGFR RNA aptamers were immobilized on chemically modified glass surfaces. Cells tested included primary human GBM cells expressing high levels of the wild-type EGFR, as well as genetically engineered murine glioma cells overexpressing the most common EGFR mutant (EGFRvIII lacking exons 2–7) in Ink4a/Arf-deficient astrocytes. We found that surfaces functionalized with anti-EGFR aptamers could capture both the human and murine GBM cells with high sensitivity and specificity. Our findings show how novel aptamer substrates could be used to determine whether surgical resection margins are free of tumor cells, or more widely for detecting tumor cells circulating in peripheral blood to improve early detection and/or monitoring residual disease after treatment.

Background: Distributed teams, as sociotechnical systems, collaborate via technology to work on their task. The way in which they process information to inform their mental models may be examined via team communication and may unfold differently than it does in face-to-face teams. Method: We conducted our analysis on 32 three-member teams working on a planning task. Half of the teams worked as distributed teams in an electronic collaboration space, and the other half worked face-to-face without an interface. Results: Using event history analysis, we found temporal interdependencies among the initial convergence points of the multiple mental models we examined. Furthermore, the timing of mental model convergence and the onset of task work discussions were related to team performance. Differences existed in the temporal patterns of convergence and task work discussions across conditions. Conclusion: Distributed teams interacting via an electronic interface and face-to-face teams with no interface converged on multiple mental models, but their communication patterns differed. In particular, distributed teams with an electronic interface required less overall communication, converged on all mental models later in their life cycles, and exhibited more linear cognitive processes than did face-to-face teams interacting verbally. Application: Managers need unique strategies for facilitating communication and mental model convergence depending on teams’ degrees of collocation and access to an interface, which in turn will enhance team performance.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0018720810370458",""

In contrast, many of the automatic history matching methods utilize parameter sensitivities or gradients to directly update the fine-scale reservoir properties, potentially combining elements at all of these scales. In this paper we present a hierarchical streamline-assisted history matching approach that emulates the traditional structured procedures. First, a probabilistic approach is used to understand the uncertainty in the large-scale static and dynamic parameters, and to calibrate these global parameters. In this global calibration, the intent is to develop multiple models that all sensibly match the field performance. This global calibration is followed by a streamline sensitivity-based deterministic model calibration for local permeability changes in which each of the distinct models created in the global match are history matched in additional detail.","http://onepetro.org/SPEWRM/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/132642-MS/1745273/spe-132642-ms.pdf",""

The use of inflow control valves (ICV) allows us to optimize the production/injection rates of various segments along the wellbore, thereby maximizing sweep efficiency and delaying water breakthrough. We propose a practical and efficient approach for computing optimal injection and production rates given multiple geologic models with application to smart wells. Specifically, we examine the trade-off between maximizing oil recovery vs. maximizing NPV using a penalized misfit function for optimization. The waterflood sweep efficiency is maximized by equalizing the arrival times of the waterfront at the producing wells and the production acceleration is accomplished using a ‘norm’ constraint on the arrival times to accelerate injection/production rates. The ‘optimal’ strategy is decided based on a compromise between the two. Our previous work primarily focused on sweep efficiency optimization and did not account for production acceleration. There are four important elements in our current approach that makes it particularly well-suited for large-scale field applications. First, we use streamlines to efficiently and analytically compute the sensitivity of the arrival times with respect to well rates. For finite-difference models, the streamlines are easily derived from the velocity field. Second, we account for geological uncertainty via a stochastic optimization framework that relies on a combination of the expect value and variance of a performance measure from multiple realizations for risk assessments. Third, analytical forms for gradients and Hessian of the objective functions are derived which make our optimization computationally efficient for large field cases. Finally, optimization is performed under operational and facility constraints using a sequential quadratic programming approach. Multiple examples are presented to support the robustness and efficiency of the proposed optimization scheme. These include 2D synthetic examples for validation and a 3D benchmark field application.","http://onepetro.org/SPEATCE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/133882-MS/1724280/spe-133882-ms.pdf",""

The aims of this study were 1) to determine the molecular mechanisms by which obesity impairs adiponectin multimerization and stability, and 2) to determine the potential role of disulfide-bond-A oxidoreductase-like protein (DsbA-L), a recently identified adiponectin interactive protein that promotes adiponectin multimerization and stability in obesity-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and adiponectin downregulation. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a chemical chaperone that alleviates ER stress, was used to study the mechanism underlying obesity-induced adiponectin downregulation in db/db mice, high-fat diet-induced obese mice, and in ER-stressed 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The cellular levels of DsbA-L were altered by RNAi-mediated suppression or adenovirus-mediated overexpression. The protective role of DsbA-L in obesity- and ER stress–induced adiponectin downregulation was characterized. RESULTS: Treating db/db mice and diet-induced obese mice with TUDCA increased the cellular and serum levels of adiponectin. In addition, inducing ER stress is sufficient to downregulate adiponectin levels in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which could be protected by treating cells with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine or by overexpression of DsbA-L. CONCLUSIONS: ER stress plays a key role in obesity-induced adiponectin downregulation. In addition, DsbA-L facilitates adiponectin folding and assembly and provides a protective effect against ER stress–mediated adiponectin downregulation in obesity.","https://journals.org/diabetes/diabetes/article-pdf/59/11/2809/395472/zdb01110002809.pdf",""

Prior to the construction of test sections, a series of laboratory studies including strength, compressibility, swell/shrink and resilient modulus tests were performed on the selected base materials to verify their suitability as base materials for pavement construction. Pavement test sections were instrumented with horizontal inclinometers and pressure cells to monitor the long-term performance of these new base materials. Pavement surface profiling surveys were also conducted at regular intervals to monitor for any accumulated roughness of the pavement surfaces. Analysis of results obtained from both laboratory and field monitoring studies demonstrates that these secondary materials can be effectively used as pavement bases.

Whereas auction design has traditionally been an analytic process that relies on theory-driven assumptions such as bidders' rationality, bidders often exhibit unknown and variable behaviors. In this paper we present a data-driven adaptive auction mechanism that capitalizes on key properties of electronic auction markets, such as the large transaction volume, access to information, and the ability to dynamically alter the mechanism's design to acquire information about the benefits from different designs and adapt the auction mechanism online in response to actual bidders' behaviors. Our auction mechanism does not require an explicit representation of bidder behavior to infer about design profitability—a key limitation of prior approaches when they address complex auction settings. Our adaptive mechanism can also incorporate prior general knowledge of bidder behavior to enhance the search for effective designs. The data-driven adaptation and the capacity to use prior knowledge render our mechanisms particularly useful when there is uncertainty regarding bidders' behaviors or when bidders' behaviors change over time. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that the adaptive mechanism outperforms any single fixed mechanism design under a variety of settings, including when bidders' strategies evolve in response to the seller's adaptation; our mechanism's performance is also more robust than that of alternatives when prior general information about bidders' behaviors differs from the encountered behaviors.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/ijoc.1090.0353",""

For physisorption interfaces (Ag, Al, Cu, Cd, Ir, Pt, and Au), Fermi level pinning and Pauli-exclusion-induced energy-level shifts are shown to be two primary factors determining graphene’s doping types and densities. For chemisorption interfaces (Ni, Co, Ru, Pd, and Ti), the combination of Pauli-exclusion-induced energy-level shifts and hybridized states’ repulsive interactions lead to a band gap opening with metallic gap states. For practical applications, we show that external electric field can be used to modulate graphene’s energy-levels and the corresponding control of doping or energy range of hybridization.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.3524232/13962567/123711_1_online.pdf",""

We sought to determine whether a combination of essential amino acids (EAA) with low carbohydrate or high carbohydrate could effectively reduce MPB following resistance exercise and improve muscle protein net balance (NB). We hypothesized that higher levels of carbohydrate and resulting increases in circulating insulin would inhibit MPB and associated signaling, resulting in augmented NB. Thirteen male subjects were assigned to one of two groups receiving equivalent amounts of EAA (∼20 g) but differing carbohydrate levels (low = 30, high = 90 g). Groups ingested nutrients 1 h after an acute bout of leg resistance exercise. Leg phenylalanine kinetics (e.g., MPB, MPS, NB), signaling proteins, and mRNA expression were assessed on successive muscle biopsies using stable isotopic techniques, immunoblotting, and real-time quantitative PCR, respectively. MPB tended to decrease ( P < 0.1) and MPS increased ( P < 0.05) similarly in both groups following nutrient ingestion. No group differences were observed, but muscle ring finger 1 (MuRF1) protein content and MuRF1 mRNA expression increased following resistance exercise and remained elevated following nutrient ingestion, while autophagy marker (light-chain 3B-II) decreased after nutrient ingestion ( P < 0.05). Forkhead box-O3a phosphorylation, total muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx) protein, and MAFbx and caspase-3 mRNA expression were unchanged. We conclude that the enhanced muscle protein anabolic response detected when EAA+carbohydrate are ingested postresistance exercise is primarily due to an increase in MPS with minor changes in MPB, regardless of carbohydrate dose or circulating insulin level.","https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpregu.00077.2010",""

Successful RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics targeting NF-κB is challenged by small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery systems, which can render targeted in vivo delivery, efficient endolysosomal escape, and dynamic control over activation of RNAi. Here, we report near-IR (NIR) light–inducible NF-κB downregulation through folate receptor–targeted hollow gold nanospheres carrying siRNA recognizing NF-κB p65 subunit. Using micro–positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging, the targeted nanoconstructs exhibited significantly higher tumor uptake in nude mice bearing HeLa cervical cancer xenografts than nontargeted nanoparticles following i.v. administration. Mediated by hollow gold nanospheres, controllable cytoplasmic delivery of siRNA was obtained on NIR light irradiation through photothermal effect. Efficient downregulation of NF-κB p65 was achieved only in tumors irradiated with NIR light but not in nonirradiated tumors grown in the same mice. Liver, spleen, kidney, and lung were not affected by the treatments, in spite of significant uptake of the siRNA nanoparticles in these organs. We term this mode of action “photothermal transfection.” Combined treatments with p65 siRNA photothermal transfection and irinotecan caused substantially enhanced tumor apoptosis and significant tumor growth delay compared with other treatment regimens. Therefore, photothermal transfection of NF-κB p65 siRNA could effectively sensitize the tumor to chemotherapeutic agents. Because NIR light can penetrate the skin and be delivered with high spatiotemporal control, therapeutic RNAi may benefit from this novel transfection strategy while avoiding unwanted side effect.

Findings suggest that social networks, economic factors, and future expectancies are significant predictors of the level of substance use among homeless young adults. Being able to identify those areas that place homeless young adults at risk for substance abuse and dependence has implications for effective intervention.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/08897070903442566",""

Breakthroughs in the understanding of underlying molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis has led to the discovery and design of several drugs capable of exerting effects on key targets essential for tumor propagation. Consider rapamycin and LY294002, drugs that target the PI3K/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, a pathway found to be dysregulated in breast cancer. The objective is to generate a nanoscale platform capable of site-specifically delivering a powerful payload of PI3K/mTOR inhibitors for the synergistic treatmentof breast tumors. The novel, injectable nanocarrier consists of three components: 1) mesoporous silicon particles (MSPs) that will be injected into the bloodstream and housing; 2) nanoparticles (polymer micelles) loaded with; 3) PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. We hypothesize that this platform will provide for enhanced bioavailability and drug synergy at tumor sites.","https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/70/24_Supplement/P6-14-10/560739/Abstract-P6-14-10-Treatment-of-Breast-Cancer-Using",""

Betulinic acid (BA) and curcumin inhibited bladder cancer cell growth and downregulated specificity protein (Sp) transcription factors, and this was accompanied by decreased expression of EGFR mRNA and protein levels. EGFR, a putative Sp-regulated gene, was also decreased in cells transfected with a cocktail (iSp) containing small inhibitory RNAs for Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4, and RNA interference with individual Sp knockdown indicated that EGFR expression was primarily regulated by Sp1 and Sp3. BA, curcumin, and iSp also decreased phosphorylation of Akt in these cells, and downregulation of EGFR by BA, curcumin, and iSp was accompanied by induction of LC3 and autophagy, which is consistent with recent studies showing that EGFR suppresses autophagic cell death. The results show that EGFR is an Sp-regulated gene in bladder cancer, and drugs such as BA and curcumin that repress Sp proteins also ablate EGFR expression. Thus, compounds such as curcumin and BA that downregulate Sp transcription factors represent a novel class of anticancer drugs that target EGFR in bladder cancer cells and tumors by inhibiting receptor expression.

In this paper we show that if the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) manually inspects all those passengers classified as likely attackers and sends others through a screening system, as it did when it deployed the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS), then it is superior to no profiling on all four performance measures if and only if the quality of the profiler vis-à-vis that of the screening system is sufficiently high. If the quality of the screening device is sufficiently high, profiling could be detrimental on all four performance measures. On the other hand, if the TSA deploys two screening devices along with the profiler—each screening device optimally configured for each of the two groups of passengers—then profiling improves the reliability of screening device signals, reduces the inconvenience caused to normal passengers, and improves the social welfare even when quality of the screening device is high. One of the implications of our findings is that the security architecture used by the TSA when it deployed CAPPS could provide a strong support to the arguments by some against the use of profiling; however, if the TSA deploys a two-screening device architecture, it might not only blunt the criticism that profiling is discriminatory but also benefit normal passengers and overall society economically.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/opre.1090.0793",""

The structures consist of a Pt surface monolayer and a composite core having an anchor bilayer where C atoms in the interstitial sites lock 3d metals in their locations, thus avoiding their surface segregation and posterior dissolution. The modified subsurface geometry induces less strain on the top surface, thus exerting a favorable effect on the surface catalytic activity where the adsorption strength of the oxygenated species becomes more moderate: weaker than on pure Pt(111) but stronger than on a Pt monolayer having a 3d metal subsurface. Here we analyze the effect of changing the nature of the 3d metal in the subsurface anchor bilayer, and we also test the use of a Pd monolayer instead of Pt on the surface. It is found that a subsurface constituted by two layers with an approximate composition of M2C (M=Fe, Ni, and Co) provides a barrier for the migration of subsurface core metal atoms to the surface. Consequently, an enhanced resistance against dissolution in parallel to improved oxygen reduction activity is expected, as given by the values of adsorption energies of reaction intermediates, delayed onset of water oxidation, and/or low coverage of oxygenated species at surface oxidation potentials.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.3481482/15431220/134705_1_online.pdf",""

XRD results showed that increasing the number of deposited layers caused an incremental increase on the detected peak intensities, aided in the promotion of the perovskite phase, and diminished the presence of the pyrochlore phase. It was also observed, during electrical measurements, that increasing the number deposited layers directly increased the overall capacitance of the thin-film structure. This effect was attributed primarily to the large amount of perovskite and large size of grains presented on thick samples.","https://www.scientific.net/MSF.644.97.pdf",""

The current challenges remain in the lack of precision of measuring techniques and understanding the behavior of neuron. Here, we report a fluid shear method to investigate adhesion at the neuron/poly-D-lysine interface. In this study, the adhesion of 12-day-old chick embryo-retina neurons cultured on poly-D-lysine coated glass coverslips was measured via parallel disk rotational flow. The shear stress experienced by the cells increases with the disk radius. There is a critical point along the radius (Rc) where the stress experienced by the neurons equals their adhesion. The measured Rc can be used to calculate the neuron adhesion. Our results demonstrate that neurons adhered to the poly-D-lysine had a strain hardening effect. The adhesive shear stress of the neuron-material increased with applied shear (τa). When the τa reached or exceeded the value of 40 dyn/cm2, the adhesion remained constant at approximately 30 dyn/cm2. The present work allowed us not only to quantify the adhesive strength and force but also to evaluate the value of strain hardening at the neuron/poly-D-lysine interface.","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/1.3456504/13370096/024702_1_online.pdf",""

Thiocolchicoside, a semisynthetic colchicoside from the plant Gloriosa superba, is a muscle relaxant and used to treat rheumatologic and orthopedic disorders because of its analgesic and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Given that activation of the transcription factor NF-κB plays a major role in inflammation and tumorigenesis, we postulated that thiocolchicoside would inhibit NF-κB and exhibit anticancer effects through the modulation of NF-κB–regulated proteins. We show that thiocolchicoside inhibited proliferation of leukemia, myeloma, squamous cell carcinoma, breast, colon, and kidney cancer cells. Formation of tumor colonies was also suppressed by thiocolchicoside. The colchicoside induced apoptosis, as indicated by caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and suppressed the expression of cell survival [e.g., Bcl-2, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), MCL-1, bcl-xL, cIAP-1, cIAP-2, and cFLIP] proteins. Cell proliferation biomarkers such as c-MYC and phosphorylation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase and glycogen synthase kinase 3β were also blocked by thiocolchicoside. Because most cell survival and proliferation gene products are regulated by NF-κB, we studied the effect of thiocolchicoside on this transcription factor and found that thiocolchicoside inhibited NF-κB activation, degradation of inhibitory κBα (IκBα), IκBα ubiquitination, and phosphorylation, abolished the activation of IκBα kinase, and suppressed p65 nuclear translocation. This effect of thiocolchicoside on the NF-κB pathway led to inhibition of NF-κB reporter activity and cyclooxygenase-2 promoter activity. Our results indicate that thiocolchicoside exhibits anticancer activity through inhibition of NF-κB and NF-κB–regulated gene products, which provides novel insight into a half-century old drug.

Function means trees (FMT) and design matrices (DM) are constructed for each of the architectures and are used in deciding whether the architecture is a coupled, uncoupled, or decoupled design per the independence axiom. The choice is supported by means of simulation results obtained for each architecture.
